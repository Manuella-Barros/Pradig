He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in The Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 79 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nNo Open redux: Bryson DeChambeau (76), Rory McIlroy (78) befuddled at Royal Troon\n\nThe two players who decided the U.S. Open will be struggling to make the cut at The Open Championship.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/4fCrJZnKpt6SwCjVUx_hHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_golf_channel_404/2a2892a0a4165cd0982f82e9b5dba370", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines British Open notebook: McIlroy, DeChambeau, Woods stumble badly out of the gates\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.",

I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years'.\n\n'No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.'\n\nRead More Escape to Manhattan, changing his phone number... how McIlroy bounced back from US Open meltdown\n\nA downbeat Rory McIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run of holes around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven over par, 12 shots behind Lowry.\n\nAccording to statistician Justin Ray, lead data analyst at KPMG Performance Insights, 87 per cent of Open winners since 1960 have been within four shots of the lead after the first round.\n\nLowry exchanged a fist bump with his caddie Darren Reynolds after a successful opener\n\nDaniel Brown trails Lowry by one shot at the close of play on Thursday evening in Scotland\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: 'I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.'\n\nThe 35-year-old, who agonisingly missed out on an overdue fifth major title in last month's US Open, added: 'I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n'But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine, thinking that I could maybe get those couple of shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\n'Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n'I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.'\n\nHot off winning his second US Open, Bryson DeChambeau found himself well down the field\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second US Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 included a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth, where he could only advance his second shot a few yards from heavy rough before hitting his next onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\n'It was a thick lie and I tried to hit a 7-iron out, and I didn't get it high enough,' DeChambeau said.\n\n'Then I tried to fade a 5-wood and it squirted off the left side of my clubface and just shot left. I'm just glad nobody got hurt.'\n\nThomas had set the clubhouse target on three under par thanks to birdies on the 17th and 18th, the two-time major winner's 68 representing a 14-shot improvement on his opening round at Hoylake last year.\n\nFormer world number one Justin Thomas is two shots behind Lowry and comfortable with his play on day one\n\n'I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking or how it was then,' Thomas said when asked to compare the two rounds.\n\n'I'm just worried about how I am now, and I'm very pleased with my game and know things are continuing to work in the right direction. I've just got to keep trying to play well.'\n\nSweden's Alex Noren, who only secured his place in the field via a tie for 10th in the Scottish Open on Sunday, was a shot off the pace alongside American Russell Henley and Ryder Cup team-mates Justin Rose and Nicolai Hojgaard.\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in his bogey-free 69.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club",

It came from the opposite direction off the Irish Sea, accompanied by occasional rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone was expecting.\n\nTurns out that wasn't even the biggest surprise Thursday.\n\nDaniel Brown made his major championship tournament debut a memorable one. The 29-year-old from England birdied two of the last three holes for a 6-under-par 65, giving him a one-shot lead over 2019 British Open champion Shane Lowry of Ireland with just enough spectators left in the Scottish twilight to celebrate Brown's amazing day.\n\nIt was getting too dark to take a photo of his name atop the leaderboard, and that didn't interest him anyway. There are at least 54 holes to go in the year's final major, though he was only focused on the next 18.\n\n\"I'm going to try and keep my feet on the ground a bit,\" he said, \"and take on the job again tomorrow.\"\n\nBrown, whose lone win on the Europe-based DP World Tour came last September in Northern Ireland, arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying opportunity for this tournament; the other was the Scottish Open, where he made the cut before finishing 61st on Sunday.\n\nWeather is almost always a factor in links golf, but the wind at Royal Troon managed to stand out even for a British Open. Yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keep it together on the way back, it was tough from start to finish.\n\nFour-time major champion Rory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot a 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for reigning U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Tiger Woods won 14 major titles from 1997 to 2008 and a 15th at the 2019 Masters, but these days, every trip to one of golf's biggest four events is tough on the 48-year-old. He had a 79, his highest opening round in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start. He at least knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it. Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today\" said Lowry, five years removed from his lone major title at Northern Ireland's Royal Portrush.\n\nTwo-time PGA Championship winner Justin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if the 31-year-old American's score didn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he started the Scottish Open with a 62 at the Renaissance Club in North Berwick on the other side of the country -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Royal Troon. He was alone in third.\n\nThe group at 69 included Xander Schauffele, who won the PGA Championship in May for his first major title, and 2013 U.S. Open champ Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free -- and with greater appreciation of this British Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70 that had him tied for 11th.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" said the American star who has been atop the Official World Golf Ranking for more than a year. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 (yards) to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nChattanooga resident Stephan Jaeger, who won the Houston Open in March for his first PGA Tour victory, made his British Open debut. The 35-year-old former Baylor School and University of Tennessee at Chattanooga standout from Germany was 5 over at the turn after a trio of bogeys and a double, and while he would make two more on the 12th and 14th, they sandwiched an eagle on the 13th. Birdies on the 16th and 18th allowed him to finish off a 74, tied for 69th in the field of 156 players.\n\nHarris English, one of Jaeger's former teammates at Baylor, is playing the British Open for the fourth consecutive year and ninth time overall. He missed the cut in the past two and started this one with a 76 that left him tied for 96th.\n\nAP photo by Scott Heppell / Shane Lowry catches a golf ball as he prepares to putt on the 18th green at Royal Troon during the opening round of the British Open on Thursday in Troon, Scotland. Lowry shot a 66 and was alone in second place behind Daniel Brown.\n\nLowry hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh hole from about 10 feet and hit a wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to five feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennent's were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop, and he missed a four-foot putt and made a double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery: \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to a bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine,\" Thomas said, \"but stayed patient and kept plugging.\"\n\nHe avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, then finished with a 6-iron to eight feet for a birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much the wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of at least that many stokes.\n\nMcIlroy broke 80, but not by much.\n\nThe 35-year-old from Northern Ireland was hopeful of one last chance in 2024 to end his drought in the majors that has reached a decade. Now he only wants to make it to the weekend.\n\nHe took two shots to get out of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and he sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out of bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that, other options present themselves, and you start to second-guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said. \"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club",

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course.

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nSign Up for Newsletters\n\nEmail*\n\nSelect Newsletters to Sign Up For\n\nNews Updates\n\nBreaking News\n\nSports Digest\n\nObituaries and Death Notices\n\nSubmit\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "news-journal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Longview News-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/news-journal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/e6/7e6ae7dc-4549-11ef-ba2b-0f9256c02ade/669983a6bbd24.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Jon Super)TROON, Scotland (AP) - The wind caught just about everyone off guard Thursday in the British Open. It came from the opposite direction off the Irish Sea, accompanied by occasional rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone was expecting. Turns out that wasn't even the biggest surprise. Daniel Brown made his major championship debut a memorable one. He birdied two of the last three holes for a 6-under 65, giving him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry with just enough spectators left in the Scottish twilight to celebrate his amazing day. It was getting too dark to take a photo of his name atop the leaderboard, and that doesn't interest the 29-year-old from England, anyway. \"I'm going to try and keep my feet on the ground a bit and take on the job again tomorrow,\"\u009d Brown said. A one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st. But this day was all about the wind - yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish. Rory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay. Lowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect. \"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\"\u009d Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\u009d Justin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 - he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open - and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon. The group at 69 included Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., who ended his round with a birdie on 18, PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in. Throw in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70. \"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\"\u009d Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\u009d Corey Conners of Listowel, Ont., shot an even round of 71, while Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin, both from Abbotsford, B.C., were at 4-over 75. Lowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\"\u009d that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole. He also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66. The applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday. \"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\"\u009d he said. \"It was late in the afternoon - a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\u009d Thomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card. His tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\"\u009d They eventually found it, but it led to bogey. \"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\"\u009d Thomas said. Indeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping - 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole. Justin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher. McIlroy broke 80, but not by much. He was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now McIlroy only wants to make it to the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind. \"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\"\u009d McIlroy said. \"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\u009d ___ AP golf:", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the Open Championship, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 - he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open - and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon - a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0718%2Fr1360315_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium.

One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keep it together on the way back, it was tough from start to finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 79 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here.

I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennent's were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop, and he missed a four-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much the wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nMcIlroy broke 80, but not by much.\n\nHe was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years.

Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second-guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@register-herald.com", "name": "Doug Ferguson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Feet", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/register-herald.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/7a/27aad32e-84c5-53f1-a760-bb30eb3e0d4b/6697f079a065e.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nDundas, Ont., native Mackenzie Hughes was the top Canadian, shot 2-under 69 for a share of fourth. Listowel, Ont., native Corey Conners closed his round even par, while Abbotsford, B.C., natives Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin laboured to 4-over finishes.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nWATCH | Canada's Hughes off to hot start following Round 1 of British Open:\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mackenzie Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Taylor_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Taylor (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Hadwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Hadwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.7268541.1721338501!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/2161952597.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

McIlroy struggled to an opening 78. England's Daniel Brown birdied two of his last three holes to card a six-under 65.\n\nIt was a contrast that immediately brought to mind the 2019 Open at Royal Portrush, when Lowry started with a 67 on his way to the Claret Jug and McIlroy's chances were blown away with a 79.\n\n\"It was enjoyable,\" Lowry, who made birdies on the fourth, seventh, eighth, 11th and 18th, told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I got off to a bit of an iffy start and holed a couple of nice par putts early on and then I was off and running.\n\n\"I try not to think about it [2019] too much now. I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years'.\n\n\"No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nMcIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run of holes around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was even par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind, McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven-over par, 12 shots behind Lowry.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old, who missed out on a fifth major title in last month's U.S. Open, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine, thinking that I could maybe get those couple of shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second U.S. Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 included a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth, where he could only advance his second shot a few yards from heavy rough before hitting his next onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\n\"It was a thick lie and I tried to hit a 7-iron out, and I didn't get it high enough,\" DeChambeau said.\n\n\"Then I tried to fade a 5-wood and it squirted off the left side of my clubface and just shot left. I'm just glad nobody got hurt.\"\n\nThomas had set the clubhouse target on three under par thanks to birdies on the 17th and 18th, the two-time major winner's 68 representing a 14-shot improvement on his opening round at Hoylake last year.\n\n\"I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking or how it was then,\" Thomas said when asked to compare the two rounds.\n\n\"I'm just worried about how I am now, and I'm very pleased with my game and know things are continuing to work in the right direction. I've just got to keep trying to play well.\"\n\nSweden's Alex Noren, who only secured his place in the field via a tie for 10th in the Scottish Open on Sunday, was a shot off the pace alongside American Russell Henley and Ryder Cup teammates Justin Rose and Nicolai Hojgaard.\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in his bogey-free 69.\n\nTiger Woods, three-time Open champion, struggled to an 8-over 79.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conor_langs@westhawaiitoday.com", "name": "Conor Langs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoylake", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hoylake"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hoylake"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/web1_OCR1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He recovered with two birdies over the final three holes for a 2-under 69, giving him a two-shot lead as the second round headed for a conclusion.\n\nAnd now he gets to wait even longer before he plays again, a product of being in the lead and among the late starters on the weekend with the silver claret jug he won five years ago at Royal Portrush coming more into view.\n\nHe was at 7-under 135, two shots ahead of surprise 18-hole leader Daniel Brown of England (72) and Justin Rose (68). Lowry shared the 36-hole lead when he won at Portrush in 2019.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to have a very late tee time tomorrow. I'm not going to be playing for another 24 hours. I know what that's about,\" Lowry said. \"I know tomorrow is going to be a long day, but I've done it before.\n\n\"For me, it's just about going out and playing my own game, shooting the best score I can. Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff.\"\n\nIt was best to keep blinders on at Royal Troon. There were some harrowing scenes.\n\nJustin Thomas, who opened with a 68 to get himself in the mix, shot a 45 on the front nine and played his best golf from there to salvage a 78 and make sure he at least made the cut.\n\nRobert MacIntyre had an even tougher start. Scotland's biggest star after winning his national Open last week, MacIntyre was stuck in pot bunkers and high grass. He was 8 over for his round through four holes -- four holes! -- and then put together a big fight on the back nine in a bid to make the weekend.\n\nAguri Iwasaki had them all beat. He took a 9 on consecutive holes and shot 52 on the back nine for a 91. One of those 9s was on the par-3 14th, where he took four shots out of two bunkers and once had to go backward toward the fairway.\n\nTiger Woods missed another cut in a major -- that was one of the few surprises because he opened with a 79 -- but left his mark by tying his own mark with his highest 36-hole score as a pro with 156. The only time he had a higher 36-hole score was at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a senior in high school.\n\nWoods had company in leaving early. Rory McIlroy, who started with a 78, needed a good start and got a triple bogey on the par-5 fourth hole. He barely moved it from high grass, chipped from more rough into a bunker and missed a 4-foot putt.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler missed all that calamity. He put together another steady round of 70 -- three birdies, two bogeys and the rest pars -- and joined the group at 2-under 140. He was five shots behind Lowry as he chases his second major of the year.\n\nJoaquin Niemann of Chile managed another 71 despite taking a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 eighth hole -- the Postage Stamp -- that measures a mere 123 yards. He was in three bunkers around the tiny green and three-putted when he finally got out of them. Niemann also made six birdies in a most remarkable round of level par.\n\nSo much chaos across the century-old links, and it looked for a brief moment like Lowry might take part. It took so long to play the 11th hole that Jordan Spieth in the group behind him walked over to the side of the fairway and sat down near a gorse bush to wait.\n\nLowry at least kept it in play, though it was in the rough to the right. He was distracted by a photographer and angry at himself for not backing off the shot that he tugged left toward a clump of gorse.\n\nFiguring it would be lost in the prickly mess, Lowry hit a provisional for a lost ball onto the green, a terrific shot. One problem. Someone found the ball. It was no longer lost, so the provisional ball was not in play.\n\nLowry took a penalty drop from the bush, going back to find a place where he had a swing, put it short of the green, chipped on and salvaged a double bogey 6.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" Lowry said.\n\nHe made five birdies on the day, and yet nothing felt better than a par. That came on the 12th, one of the toughest holes into the wind. He hit driver and 4-iron to 30 feet, two putts for a most beautiful, calming par.\n\n\"The best shots I've hit all week,\" Lowry said. \"From then on, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAnd now comes a big opportunity for Lowry to reclaim that claret jug, for Rose to become the first player in the modern era of exemptions to come through 36-hole qualifying, and for Brown to become one of the biggest surprises since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.\n\nAnd so many others are very much in the mix, starting with Scheffler, golf's best player.\n\n\"I've played two solid rounds and it put me five shots back, and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts,\" Scheffler said, making it all sound so simple on a day when nothing felt easy.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nSo much calamity, and it looked for a brief mome", "source":

It came from the opposite direction off the Irish Sea, accompanied by occasional rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone was expecting.\n\nTurns out that wasn't even the biggest surprise.\n\nDaniel Brown made his major championship debut a memorable one. He birdied two of the last three holes for a 6-under 65, giving him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry with just enough spectators left in the Scottish twilight to celebrate his amazing day.\n\nIt was getting too dark to take a photo of his name atop the leaderboard, and that doesn't interest the 29-year-old from England, anyway.\n\n\"I'm going to try and keep my feet on the ground a bit and take on the job again tomorrow,\" Brown said.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 69 included Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., who ended his round with a birdie on 18, PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nCorey Conners of Listowel, Ont., shot an even round of 71, while Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin, both from Abbotsford, B.C., were at 4-over 75.\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nMcIlroy broke 80, but not by much.\n\nHe was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now McIlroy only wants to make it to the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nDoug Ferguson, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "tricitynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tri-City

Lowry was at 7 under overall, two strokes ahead of Justin Rose and Daniel Brown. Scott Heppell/Associated Press\n\nTROON, Scotland -- Shane Lowry found himself in a familiar position in the British Open, even if it required a detour that could have rattled him on a wild day Friday at Royal Troon.\n\nLowry took what seemed like an eternity to make a double bogey on the 11th hole. He recovered with two birdies over the final three holes for a 2-under 69, giving him a two-shot lead as the second round headed for a conclusion.\n\nAnd now he gets to wait even longer before he plays again, a product of being in the lead and among the late starters on the weekend, with the silver claret jug he won five years ago at Royal Portrush coming more into view.\n\nHe was at 7-under 135, two shots ahead of Justin Rose (68) and surprise 18-hole leader Daniel Brown of England (72). Lowry shared the 36-hole lead when he won at Portrush in 2019.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to have a very late tee time tomorrow. I'm not going to be playing for another 24 hours. I know what that's about,\" Lowry said. \"I know tomorrow is going to be a long day, but I've done it before.\n\n\"For me, it's just about going out and playing my own game, shooting the best score I can. Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was best to keep blinders on at Royal Troon. There were some harrowing scenes.\n\nJustin Thomas, who opened with a 68 to get himself in the mix, shot a 45 on the front nine and played his best golf from there to salvage a 78 and make sure he at least was inside the cut line.\n\nRobert MacIntyre had an even tougher start. Scotland's biggest star after winning his national Open last week, MacIntyre was stuck in pot bunkers and high grass. He was 8 over for his round through four holes, and then was 4 under the rest of the way to make it to the weekend.\n\nAguri Iwasaki took a 9 on consecutive holes and shot 52 on the back nine for a 91. One of those 9s was on the par-3 14th, where he needed four shots out of two bunkers and once had to go backward toward the fairway.\n\nTiger Woods missed another cut in a major - that was one of the few surprises, because he opened with a 79 - and tied his highest 36-hole score as a pro at 156. The only time he had a higher 36-hole score was at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a senior in high school.\n\nWoods had company in leaving early. Rory McIlroy, who started with a 78 on Thursday, made a triple bogey on the par-5 fourth hole. He barely moved the ball from high grass, chipped from more rough into a bunker and missed a 4-foot putt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler avoided all that calamity. He put together another steady round of 70 - three birdies, two bogeys - and was tied for fourth at 2-under 140 as he chases his second major of the year. Billy Horschel and Dean Burmester were also at 2 under.\n\nJoaquin Niemann of Chile managed another 71 despite taking a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 eighth hole - the Postage Stamp - that measures a mere 123 yards. He was in three bunkers around the tiny green and three-putted when he finally got out of them. Niemann also made six birdies in a most remarkable round.\n\nThere was so much chaos across the century-old links, and for a brief moment, Lowry was involved. It took so long to play the 11th hole that Jordan Spieth in the group behind him walked over to the side of the fairway and sat down near a gorse bush to wait.\n\nLowry at least kept his ball in play, though it was in the rough to the right. He was distracted by a photographer and angry at himself for not backing off a shot that he tugged left toward a clump of gorse.\n\nFiguring it would be lost in the prickly mess, Lowry hit a provisional for a lost ball onto the green, a terrific shot. One problem: Someone found his ball. It was no longer lost, so the provisional ball was not in play.\n\nLowry took a penalty drop from the bush, going back to find a place where he had a swing, put it short of the green, chipped on, and salvaged a double bogey 6.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" Lowry said.\n\nHe made five birdies, and yet nothing felt better than a par on the 12th, one of the toughest holes into the wind. He hit driver and 4-iron to 30 feet, and needed two putts for a most beautiful, calming par.\n\n\"The best shots I've hit all week,\" Lowry said. \"From then on, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAnd now comes a big opportunity for Lowry to reclaim that claret jug, for Rose to become the first player in the modern era of exemptions to come through 36-hole qualifying and win, and for Brown to become one of the biggest surprises since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.\n\nAnd so many others are very much in the mix, starting with Scheffler, golf's best player.\n\n\"I've played two solid rounds and it put me five shots back, and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts,\" Scheffler said, making it all sound so simple on a day when nothing felt easy.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\nRelated Stories Latest

It wasn't a disaster,\" said Lowry on his travails at 11.\n\n\"To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here.\"\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nA monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nWoods' tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\n\"I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again,\" he said.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score leaving him in 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nScottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre's dreams of a first major on home soil unravelled as he dropped eight shots in his first four holes to drop to nine over.",

I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nA downbeat McIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven over par, 12 behind his great friend Lowry.\n\nAccording to statistician Justin Ray, lead data analyst at KPMG Performance Insights, 87 per cent of Open winners since 1960 have been within four shots of the lead after the first round.\n\nSpectators search for Rory McIlroy\u00b4s ball after he drove out of bounds on the 11th (Jane Barlow/PA)\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old, who agonisingly missed out the US Open title last month, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second US Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 included a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth, where he could only advance his second shot a few yards from heavy rough before hitting his next onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\nThomas had set the early clubhouse target on three under par thanks to birdies on the 17th and 18th, the two-time major winner's 68 representing a 14-shot improvement on his opening round at Hoylake last year.\n\n\"I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking or how it was then,\" Thomas said when asked to compare the two rounds.\n\n\"I'm just worried about how I am now, and I'm very pleased with my game and know things are continuing to work in the right direction.\"\n\nFormer supermarket delivery driver Joe Dean was part of a seven-way tie for fourth place on two under par which included US PGA winner Xander Schauffele and Ryder Cup team-mates Nicolai Hojgaard and Justin Rose.\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in a bogey-free 69.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It wasn't pretty - he hit it thin and it shot like a bullet straight across the other side of the green.\n\nMicrophones captured a reaction most weekend hacks can relate too. He then took his hat off, muttered \"f--- it, I'm out,\" shook his playing partner's hands, and walked off Royal Troon.\n\nThe Frenchman later took to social media to explain it was a back injury that forced him out, rather than a rage quit.\n\n\"Hurt my back on hole 4 and it became (worse and worse) after it ... see you next year,\" he said on X.\n\nLangasque had bogeyed the first, but bounced back with a birdie on the second. He made par on the third, but bogeyed three of the next four holes before pulling the pin.\n\nAt the top of the leaderboard, Daniel Brown had a major debut he won't soon forget.\n\nHe birdied two of the last three holes to card a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" he said.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said.\n\n\"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No.2 today, I had (151m) to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about (187m). It went probably $141m) at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 112m hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a near 8m putt on the 10th, before holing a six metre birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4-under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only the first round.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said.\n\n\"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4-under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\"\n\nThey eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 8m on the 419m closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years.\n\nNow he's hopeful of just sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course,\" McIlroy explained.\n\n\"Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nAdam Scott is best of the Aussies in a tie for 11th five shots back at 1-under. Min Woo Lee is a shot further behind at even par. Jason Day is at 2-over.\n\nElvis Smylie (5-over), amateur Jasper Stubbs (9-over) and Smith (9-over) will all battle to make the cut, which right now would be at 4-over.", "source": {"uri":

Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like the crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Daly_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Daly (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0718%2Fr1360315_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I felt through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And Darren (Reynolds, his caddie) did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nBrown might have been expected to come back down to earth with a bump after his Thursday heroics, but the 29-year-old from Northallerton delivered an impressive sequel on his major debut.\n\n\"I've always been quite laid back really,\" Brown said. \"I think I am a bit of a realist as well.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to start getting ahead of myself and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm leading the Open' or 'I'm second in the Open' or whatever.\n\n\"There's still 36 holes left. I might have a good round tomorrow and then I might have a stinky round on Sunday. You just don't know.\"\n\nRose's round drew high praise from six-time major winner Sir Nick Faldo, the last English winner of the Open in 1992, during a commentary stint on Sky Sports.\n\n\"Maybe the best 68 of his whole career on a day like today in this wind,\" Faldo said.\n\nSpeaking about his chance to make history, Rose said: \"When I won the US Open (in 2013) it was like 'First since Tony Jacklin' and they are nice moments when they come together, but you are never thinking of it.\n\n\"In the moment you are just trying to get the job done.\"\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel and Dean Burmester were five shots off the lead on two under par, with Jason Day, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Corey Conners all one under.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk",

It was late in the afternoon and a few pints of Tennent's were had out there. It felt more like the weekend.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\n\n\"The walk down 18 was actually pretty cool. I said to Billy Foster (Matt Fitzpatrick's caddie) that it's the greatest walk in golf and I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house. That's the plan, to try to get to do that again.\n\n\"I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again and that's why I'm here this week.\n\n\"No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nA downbeat McIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven over par, 12 behind his great friend Lowry.\n\nAccording to statistician Justin Ray, lead data analyst at KPMG Performance Insights, 87 per cent of Open winners since 1960 have been within four shots of the lead after the first round.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old, who agonisingly missed out the US Open title last month, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second US Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 included a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth, where he could only advance his second shot a few yards from heavy rough before hitting his next onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\nThomas had set the early clubhouse target on three under par thanks to birdies on the 17th and 18th, the two-time major winner's 68 representing a 14-shot improvement on his opening round at Hoylake last year.\n\n\"I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking or how it was then,\" Thomas said when asked to compare the two rounds.\n\n\"I'm just worried about how I am now, and I'm very pleased with my game and know things are continuing to work in the right direction.\"\n\nFormer supermarket delivery driver Joe Dean was part of a seven-way tie for fourth place on two under par which included US PGA winner Xander Schauffele and Ryder Cup team-mates Nicolai Hojgaard and Justin Rose.\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in a bogey-free 69.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

So I assumed that was OK.\n\nIreland\u00b4s Shane Lowry reacts as he plays a shot from the rough on the 11th during day two at Royal Troon (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I felt through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And Darren (Reynolds, his caddie) did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\nAnything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on Shane Lowry\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nBrown might have been expected to come back down to earth with a bump after his Thursday heroics, but the 29-year-old from Northallerton delivered an impressive sequel on his major debut.\n\n\"I've always been quite laid back really,\" Brown said. \"I think I am a bit of a realist as well.\n\nEngland\u00b4s Daniel Brown remains in contention (Zac Goodwin/PA)\n\n\"I know I'm not going to start getting ahead of myself and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm leading the Open' or 'I'm second in the Open' or whatever.\n\n\"There's still 36 holes left. I might have a good round tomorrow and then I might have a stinky round on Sunday. You just don't know.\"\n\nRose's round drew high praise from six-time major winner Sir Nick Faldo, the last English winner of the Open in 1992, during a commentary stint on Sky Sports.\n\n\"Maybe the best 68 of his whole career on a day like today in this wind,\" Faldo said.\n\nSpeaking about his chance to make history, Rose said: \"When I won the US Open (in 2013) it was like 'First since Tony Jacklin' and they are nice moments when they come together, but you are never thinking of it.\n\n\"In the moment you are just trying to get the job done.\"\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel and Dean Burmester were five shots off the lead on two under par, with Jason Day, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Corey Conners all one under.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Howell_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Howell (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jacklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Jacklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Faldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Faldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/19/20/wire-87551649-1721417547-923_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nJohn Deere will lay off an undetermined number of salaried workers beginning next week One dead in early morning shooting in Hudson Interstate traffic shut down for person on bridge Four injured in wrong-way crash Waterloo day care operator charged with three counts of child endangerment NEW DETAILS: John Deere announces another 345 layoffs at Waterloo facilities Iowa restaurant inspection update: Grimy blenders, mouse droppings and bad sushi Colleagues remember Waverly-Shell Rock principal Suz SmolikHagen Apartment hit in weekend shooting UPDATE WITH NAME: One dead in tanker crash south of Hudson High School Baseball: Don Bosco wins substate thriller over Saint Ansgar Trump injured but 'fine' after attempted assassination at rally; shooter and one attendee are dead Kathyrn Koob: Remarkable journey from farm girl to diplomat and esteemed educator One arrested in downtown shooting Waterloo council votes 4-2 to allow for construction of tiny home\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and

I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years'.\n\n\"No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nA downbeat Rory McIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run of holes around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven over par, 12 shots behind Lowry.\n\nAccording to statistician Justin Ray, lead data analyst at KPMG Performance Insights, 87 per cent of Open winners since 1960 have been within four shots of the lead after the first round.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old, who agonisingly missed out on an overdue fifth major title in last month's US Open, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine, thinking that I could maybe get those couple of shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second US Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 included a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth, where he could only advance his second shot a few yards from heavy rough before hitting his next onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\n\"It was a thick lie and I tried to hit a 7-iron out, and I didn't get it high enough,\" DeChambeau said.\n\n\"Then I tried to fade a 5-wood and it squirted off the left side of my clubface and just shot left. I'm just glad nobody got hurt.\"\n\nThomas had set the clubhouse target on three under par thanks to birdies on the 17th and 18th, the two-time major winner's 68 representing a 14-shot improvement on his opening round at Hoylake last year.\n\n\"I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking or how it was then,\" Thomas said when asked to compare the two rounds.\n\n\"I'm just worried about how I am now, and I'm very pleased with my game and know things are continuing to work in the right direction. I've just got to keep trying to play well.\"\n\nSweden's Alex Noren, who only secured his place in the field via a tie for 10th in the Scottish Open on Sunday, was a shot off the pace alongside American Russell Henley and Ryder Cup team-mates Justin Rose and Nicolai Hojgaard.\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in his bogey-free 69.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_casey@aol.co.uk", "name": "Phil Casey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

He recovered with two birdies over the final three holes for a 2-under 69, giving him a two-shot lead as the second round headed for a conclusion.\n\nAnd now he gets to wait even longer before he plays again, a product of being in the lead and among the late starters on the weekend with the silver claret jug he won five years ago at Royal Portrush coming more into view.\n\nHe was at 7-under 135, two shots ahead of surprise 18-hole leader Daniel Brown of England (72) and Justin Rose (68). Lowry shared the 36-hole lead when he won at Portrush in 2019.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to have a very late tee time tomorrow. I'm not going to be playing for another 24 hours. I know what that's about,\" Lowry said. \"I know tomorrow is going to be a long day, but I've done it before.\n\n\"For me, it's just about going out and playing my own game, shooting the best score I can. Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff.\"\n\nIt was best to keep blinders on at Royal Troon. There were some harrowing scenes.\n\nJustin Thomas, who opened with a 68 to get himself in the mix, shot a 45 on the front nine and played his best golf from there to salvage a 78 and make sure he at least made the cut.\n\nRobert MacIntyre had an even tougher start. Scotland's biggest star after winning his national Open last week, MacIntyre was stuck in pot bunkers and high grass. He was 8 over for his round through four holes -- four holes! -- and then put together a big fight on the back nine in a bid to make the weekend.\n\nAguri Iwasaki had them all beat. He took a 9 on consecutive holes and shot 52 on the back nine for a 91. One of those 9s was on the par-3 14th, where he took four shots out of two bunkers and once had to go backward toward the fairway.\n\nTiger Woods missed another cut in a major -- that was one of the few surprises because he opened with a 79 -- but left his mark by tying his own mark with his highest 36-hole score as a pro with 156. The only time he had a higher 36-hole score was at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a senior in high school.\n\nWoods had company in leaving early. Rory McIlroy, who started with a 78, needed a good start and got a triple bogey on the par-5 fourth hole. He barely moved it from high grass, chipped from more rough into a bunker and missed a 4-foot putt.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler missed all that calamity. He put together another steady round of 70 -- three birdies, two bogeys and the rest pars -- and joined the group at 2-under 140. He was five shots behind Lowry as he chases his second major of the year.\n\nJoaquin Niemann of Chile managed another 71 despite taking a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 eighth hole -- the Postage Stamp -- that measures a mere 123 yards. He was in three bunkers around the tiny green and three-putted when he finally got out of them. Niemann also made six birdies in a most remarkable round of level par.\n\nSo much chaos across the century-old links, and it looked for a brief moment like Lowry might take part. It took so long to play the 11th hole that Jordan Spieth in the group behind him walked over to the side of the fairway and sat down near a gorse bush to wait.\n\nLowry at least kept it in play, though it was in the rough to the right. He was distracted by a photographer and angry at himself for not backing off the shot that he tugged left toward a clump of gorse.\n\nFiguring it would be lost in the prickly mess, Lowry hit a provisional for a lost ball onto the green, a terrific shot. One problem. Someone found the ball. It was no longer lost, so the provisional ball was not in play.\n\nLowry took a penalty drop from the bush, going back to find a place where he had a swing, put it short of the green, chipped on and salvaged a double bogey 6.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" Lowry said.\n\nHe made five birdies on the day, and yet nothing felt better than a par. That came on the 12th, one of the toughest holes into the wind. He hit driver and 4-iron to 30 feet, two putts for a most beautiful, calming par.\n\n\"The best shots I've hit all week,\" Lowry said. \"From then on, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAnd now comes a big opportunity for Lowry to reclaim that claret jug, for Rose to become the first player in the modern era of exemptions to come through 36-hole qualifying, and for Brown to become one of the biggest surprises since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.\n\nAnd so many others are very much in the mix, starting with Scheffler, golf's best player.\n\n\"I've played two solid rounds and it put me five shots back, and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts,\" Scheffler said, making it all sound so simple on a day when nothing felt easy.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Woods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend. Lowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\nLowry leads by two shots from Brown, who showed little sign of nerves under the spotlight in his first major, with a steady 72 to sit at five under.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster,\" said Lowry on his travails at 11.\n\n\"To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here.\"\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nA monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.\n\nWoods' tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\n\"I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again,\" he said.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score leaving him in 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nScottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre's dreams of a first major on home soil unravelled as he dropped eight shots in his first four holes to drop to nine over.", "source": {"uri":

But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\nWorld number three Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three 3-putts today.

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"And Darren (Reynolds, his caddie) did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nBrown might have been expected to come back down to earth with a bump after his Thursday heroics, but the 29-year-old from Northallerton delivered an impressive sequel on his major debut.\n\n\"I've always been quite laid back really,\" Brown said. \"I think I am a bit of a realist as well.\n\n\"There's still 36 holes left. I might have a good round tomorrow and then I might have a stinky round on Sunday. You just don't know.\"\n\nRose's round drew high praise from six-time major winner Sir Nick Faldo, the last English winner of the Open in 1992, during a commentary stint on Sky Sports.\n\n\"Maybe the best 68 of his whole career on a day like today in this wind,\" Faldo said.\n\nSpeaking about his chance to make history, Rose said: \"When I won the US Open (in 2013) it was like 'First since Tony Jacklin' and they are nice moments when they come together, but you are never thinking of it.\n\n\"In the moment you are just trying to get the job done.\"\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel and Dean Burmester were five shots off the lead on two under par, with Jason Day, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Corey Conners all one under.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Howell_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Howell (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jacklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Jacklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Faldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Faldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/v2/5CB3WTW5T5GA5DRCYYKDONBBMY.jpg?auth=385fb05931fcd335c3aba478d058aed906cee96d61399964fdae531083710603&width=1200&height=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It came from the opposite direction off the Irish Sea, accompanied by occasional rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone was expecting.\n\nTurns out that wasn't even the biggest surprise.\n\nDaniel Brown made his major-championship debut a memorable one. He birdied two of the last three holes for a 6-under 65, giving him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry with just enough spectators left in the Scottish twilight to celebrate his amazing day.\n\nIt was getting too dark to take a photo of his name atop the leaderboard, and that doesn't interest the 29-year-old from England, anyway.\n\n\"I'm going to try and keep my feet on the ground a bit and take on the job again tomorrow,\" Brown said.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago, and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason, I felt like the crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop, and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine, but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th, and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nMcIlroy broke 80, but not by much.\n\nHe was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now McIlroy only wants to make it to the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course,\" McIlroy said. \"Then when the wind is like that, other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Irish Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/18/id5689487-Shane-Lowry-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 69 included Mackenzie Hughes of Dundas, Ont., who ended his round with a birdie on 18, PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nCorey Conners of Listowel, Ont., shot an even round of 71, while Nick Taylor and Adam Hadwin, both from Abbotsford, B.C., were at 4-over 75.\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend.

He also dropped shots at the 10th, 15th and 18th.\n\n\"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut,\" said McIlroy.\n\n\"I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more and feel like I have half a chance.\"\n\n- Woods wobbles -\n\nDeChambeau had been the form player in the majors so far this year, despite his defection to the breakaway LIV Tour.\n\nThe American finished sixth at the Masters and runner-up in the USPGA Championship before claiming his second US Open.\n\nHowever, his struggles with the windy conditions of links golf continued as he was six over par for his opening nine holes.\n\nDeChambeau battled back on the back nine as an eagle on the 17th helped him to a 76.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" said DeChambeau.\n\n\"I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home'. But no, I've got a chance tomorrow.

names to miss the cut.\n\nOnly 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.\n\nLowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.\n\nThe Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\n\"To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here,\" said Lowry.\n\n\"The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday.\"\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nA monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nMcIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.\n\nThe world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.\n\nWoods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\n\"I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again,\" he said.\n\nThe three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.\n\nThey were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.\n\nScottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over.\n\nkca/ea/nr\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source":

Following Thursday's opening round of the 152nd Open Championship, he surely is in good spirits.\n\nLowry, part of the afternoon wave, walked off the course posting a 5-under 66. That is the lowest opening round score of his Open Championship career. As he strolled off 18, he held the lead. Ultimately, Daniel Brown (ranked 272nd in the world), passed him at 6-under.\n\nNevertheless, Lowry played flawless golf on a day where the proved incredibly difficult. Of the 156 golfers that competed, only 17 finished under par.\n\nMeanwhile, some of the game's best like Rory McIlroy, Wyndham Clark, Max Homa and Bryson DeChambeau struggled mightily. The legend himself, Tiger Woods, also had a rough go Thursday. He finished 8-over par and is staring at an early exit from Royal Troon.\n\nFollowing his opening 18, Lowry maintained composure and put his great start into perspective.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy, but it's only one day. We've got three more days. I kept telling myself that out there because for some reason I felt like the crowd were getting very excited out there. It was late in the afternoon. A few points the attendance were high out there, I'd say. They were quite excitable out there, and it felt more like the weekend,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nHandled himself is quite the understatement.\n\nLowry was one of only three players to turn in a clean card, with five birdies and zero bogeys. The aforementioned Brown and Justin Rose did so also.\n\nShane Lowry looking to repeat history at The Open\n\nThe last time Shane Lowry shot under par to begin The Open was in 2019 at Royal Portrush. He would go on to win his first and only major three days later. But the 2019 Golfer of the Year is not putting any stock into that.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, that doesn't mean anything. That was five years ago,\" said Lowry.\n\nFollowing a couple years with some tumultuous play, the Irishman seems to have found proper form. He, alongside teammate and fellow Irishman Rory McIroy, won the Zurich Classic earlier this year. He followed that up with a T6 at the PGA Championship, a top 20 finish at the U.S. Open and closed in ninth at his last tournament, the Travelers Championship.\n\nIndeed, there is a lot of golf left to play this week. The 37-year-old pro took advantage of the afternoon wave that saw lower winds and better scores. Can he replicate that Friday?

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use

If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days.\"\n\nTwo-time major winner Justin Thomas is lurking at three under, while recently crowned USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is among a group of seven on two under that also includes Justin Rose.\n\nWorld No 1 Scottie Scheffler cut a frustrated figure on the greens but is still in the mix after a one under round that featured four birdies and three bogeys.\n\nMcIlroy was aiming to get over his heartbreak at the US Open last month, where he missed two short putts to blow the lead as Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second major by one shot.\n\nHowever, the Northern Irishman's round, and probably championship, was blown off course at the postage stamp 120-yard eighth.\n\nNear-perfect shot slips off\n\nMcIlroy was unfortunate as his near-perfect tee shot slipped off the green into a bunker, which he took two attempts to escape, to post a double bogey five.\n\nAnother double bogey followed at the 11th. He also dropped shots at the 10th, 15th and 18th.\n\n\"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut,\" said McIlroy.\n\n\"I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more and feel like I have half a chance.\"\n\nWoods wobbles\n\nDeChambeau had been the form player in the majors so far this year, despite his defection to the breakaway LIV Tour.\n\nThe American finished sixth at the Masters and runner-up in the USPGA Championship before claiming his second US Open.\n\nHowever, his struggles with the windy conditions of links golf continued as he was six over par for his opening nine holes.\n\nDeChambeau battled back on the back nine as an eagle on the 17th helped him to a 76.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" said DeChambeau.\n\n\"I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home'. But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\nSchauffele's continues fine form\n\nWorld No 3 Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three 3-putts today. I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today.\"\n\nCameron Smith, champion at St. Andrews two years ago, fared even worse with an 80.\n\nWorld No 4 Ludvig

British Open lead as McIlroy, Woods miss cut", "body": "Rory McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major goes on after missing the cut at the British Open\n\nShane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.\n\nOnly 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.\n\nLowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.\n\nThe Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\n\"To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here,\" said Lowry.\n\n\"The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday.\"\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nA monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also well in the running at one under.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nMcIlroy's decade-long wait for a major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.\n\nThe world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.\n\nWoods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has

eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again,\" he said.\n\nThe three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.\n\nThey were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.\n\nScottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over.\n\nkca/ea/nr", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_canning@ktbs.com", "name":

So I assumed that was OK.\n\nIreland\u00b4s Shane Lowry reacts as he plays a shot from the rough on the 11th during day two of The Open at Royal Troon (Owen Humphreys/PA)\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I felt through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\nAnything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on Shane Lowry\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nBrown might have been expected to come back down to earth with a bump after his Thursday heroics, but the 29-year-old from Northallerton delivered an impressive sequel on his major debut.\n\nEngland\u00b4s Daniel Brown after putting on the fourth during day two of The Open at Royal Troon (Zac Goodwin/PA)\n\n\"I've always been quite laid back really,\" Brown said. \"I think I am a bit of a realist as well.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to start getting ahead of myself and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm leading the Open' or 'I'm second in the Open' or whatever.\n\n\"There's still 36 holes left. I might have a good round tomorrow and then I might have a stinky round on Sunday. You just don't know.\"\n\nRose's round drew high praise from six-time major winner Sir Nick Faldo, the last English winner of the Open in 1992, during a commentary stint on Sky Sports.\n\n\"Maybe the best 68 of his whole career on a day like today in this wind,\" Faldo said.\n\n\"When I won the US Open it was likem 'First since Tony Jacklin' and they are nice moments when they come together, but you are never thinking of it,\" Rose said of his chance to make history.\n\n\"In the moment you are just trying to get the job done.\"\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel and Dean Burmester were five shots off the lead on two under par, with Jason Day, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Corey Conners all one under.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayr", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayr"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayr"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Howell_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Howell (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jacklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Jacklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Faldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Faldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/19/18/wire-87549111-1721411848-448_636x382.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

He trails Daniel Brown, who fired off a bogey-free 6-under 65, by one shot as he sits in solo second.\n\nOnly 17 players fired under-par scores during the first round, a testament to the 25-mile-per-hour winds that blew across Royal Troon. Very few players kept a clean scorecard, too.\n\nBut Lowry's preparation for this tournament is why he is towards the top of the leaderboard after day one. He played many practice rounds early and took advantage of his later tee time.\n\n\"I'm very happy. I went out there -- lucky I watched a lot of golf this morning and saw that the golf course was not playing easy,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"I tried to go out, play my game, hit some good shots, and hole a few putts. I did that, and I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nThe Irishman had 25 putts after the first round, tied for first among the field. He made three birdies in six holes on the front nine to turn in 33 shots, a 3-under par score.\n\nLowry made another par-breaker on the 11th, and his final birdie came on the 18th.\n\nHe explained that a trip to Royal Troon two weeks ago helped him adjust to these greens.\n\n\"Sometimes I struggle when I come back from playing a season on the PGA Tour with the speed of the greens,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"I got here, and I played a couple of practice rounds here, and I was really happy with how my speed was... I wasn't struggling to get the ball to the hole because sometimes I can be like that. My speed control was very good, and I saw my lines great. I feel like links greens when you start to see your lines, the hole feels quite big, so it felt like that today, and long may it continue.\"\n\nThis 66 marks his lowest first-round score in a major championship. In 2019, at Royal Portrush, Lowry shot a 67 that first day. While he was happy with the score, the 37-year-old stayed realistic.\n\n\"It's only one day. We've got three more days,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"I kept telling myself that out there because, for some reason, I felt like the crowd was getting very excited. They were quite excitable, and it felt more like the weekend. I kept telling myself there's a lot more to do, and there's a few days left, so I stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nLowry said he would give anything to win this tournament again but does not want to look ahead. This first-round score will mean nothing if he does not play well in the next three days.\n\nSo, it appears the Irishman will keep himself grounded, as 54 holes remain Normally, Lowry likes to have an early round on Thursday and a late one on Friday, but he has the opposite this week. It is a quick turnaround that will allow him to get after it.\n\nThe conditions will be similar at The Open for Friday's round, too.\n\n\"If they are, it's not going to be easy, and pars are going to be good. That's kind of the game plan,\" Lowry said.\n\nLowry tees off at 4:47 a.m. ET for the second round with Cameron Smith and Matt Fitzpatrick.

Spokane", "body": "Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday as a tame Tiger Woods limped to 14 over to miss the cut.\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\nHe leads by two shots from Brown, who showed little sign of nerves under the spotlight in his first major, with a steady first 14 holes to sit at five under.\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nThe American was not blown off track as the winds strengthened through Friday afternoon with 11 pars in his opening 13 holes before a monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took him within striking range.\n\nHowever, a costly bogey on the last left him still four adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also in the mix after a one over par round was enough to keep him in the top 10 at one under.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nWoods' tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score a tie for 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nkca/jc\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [{"uri":

British Open lead as torrid Tiger misses cut", "body": "World number one Scottie Scheffler closed to within four shots of the lead at the British Open\n\nShane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday as a tame Tiger Woods limped to 14 over to miss the cut.\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\nHe leads by two shots from Brown, who showed little sign of nerves under the spotlight in his first major, with a steady first 14 holes to sit at five under.\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nThe American was not blown off track as the winds strengthened through Friday afternoon with 11 pars in his opening 13 holes before a monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took him within striking range.\n\nHowever, a costly bogey on the last left him still four adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also in the mix after a one over par round was enough to keep him in the top 10 at one under.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nWoods' tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score a tie for 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nkca/jc",

I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years'. No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nLowry's closest challenge came from Brown, playing in the penultimate group, who charged up the leaderboard after carding a front-nine 34 and then adding successive birdies from the tenth to get within one of the lead.\n\nBrown got up and down from a tough lie at the par-five 16th to make a birdie to move alongside Lowry, before grabbing the solo advantage after rolling in from eight feet to pick up a shot at the last - in near-darkness - and move to six under.\n\nTwo-time PGA champion Justin Thomas set the initial target after a birdie-birdie finish gave him a three-under 68, leaving him three strokes back in third, while Alex Noren, Justin Rose and reigning PGA champion Xander Schauffele are among the group in tied-fourth on two under.\n\nWorld No 1 Scottie Scheffler began his bid for a seventh victory in 11 starts with a one-under 70, leaving him in the group tied-11th also containing five-time major champion Brooks Koepka, Matt Fitzpatrick and Matt Wallace, with just 17 of the 158 players ending the day under par.\n\nDeChambeau needed a 55-foot eagle at the par-five 16th to stay within 11 shots of the lead, while McIlroy admitted his focus was simply making the cut rather than challenging for the Claret Jug after carding one of the highest opening rounds of his major career.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, having double-bogeyed the Postage Stamp as part of five dropped shots in four holes, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nWoods made a great start when he holed a long-range putt for a birdie at the third, only to add just one more in a round containing six bogeys and two double bogeys. The 48-year-old faces a quick turnaround ahead of his Friday morning tee times, where he admitted he would need to shoot in the mid-60s to have a chance of making the cut.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/768x432/skysports-golf-daniel-brown_6631266.jpg?20240718215630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to

The Offaly-man is just one shot behind clubhouse leader Daniel Brown at -6 ahead of play on Friday.\n\nLowry, the 2019 Open Championship winner, teed off at 2:59 PM alongside LIV Tour member Cameron Smith and 2022 US Open winner Matt Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe damp and breezy conditions on Thursday suited Lowry, particularly during the first four holes, which he played in -1.\n\nThe green speed on the 7,300-yard, par-71 layout was 10.7, and Lowry made two remarkable putts on the seventh and the famous Postage Stamp eighth hole, leading to an impressive front nine score of -3. Lowry's back nine was equally crucial as he played holes 10 and 11 in -1.\n\nDespite the challenges faced by the 157-strong field, Lowry managed to play 17 holes without a mistake. His round concluded with a sensational nine-iron shot from 177 yards on the 18th, followed by a successful putt, resulting in a bogey-free round of -5.\n\nThe day began early at 6:35 AM with a tribute to long-time announcer Ivor Robson, followed by Justin Leonard starting the action.\n\nOne of the notable morning groups included 2014 Open Championship winner Rory McIlroy, who teed off at 10:09 AM with Max Homa and Tyrrell Hatton.\n\nMcIlroy, competing in his first major since disappointingly losing the US Open on the final few holes, started poorly with a bogey on the first hole.\n\nHe managed to return to level par with an impressive wedge shot from 116 yards on the third hole but was hindered by a double bogey on the eighth.\n\nMcIlroy's struggles continued on the back nine, particularly on holes 10 and 11, where he played +3.\n\nHe finished his round with bogeys on the 15th and 18th, resulting in a round of 78 (+7).\n\n\"I was sort of struggling to hole the ball in that wind a little bit, and that got me,\" McIlroy said.\n\nCurrently tied for 129th, McIlroy will begin his Friday round at 3:10 PM. \"I need to do a better job in those conditions, play better, and try to shoot something under par to at least be here for the weekend,\" he added.\n\nJustin Thomas also featured in Thursday's early coverage, playing the front nine in -3 and finishing with birdies on the 17th and 18th to post a round of -3.\n\nJustin Rose, who had to qualify for this year's Open, started strong with a round of 69 (-2).\n\nXander Schauffele, recently crowned PGA Championship winner, played in the afternoon leading group with Tiger Woods and Patrick Cantlay, scoring birdies on the challenging fifth and 11th holes to end the day at -2.\n\nSeventeen players finished the day under par, with five-time major champion Brooks Koepka's opening round of -1 highlighted by four consecutive birdies from holes four to seven.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, playing his first tournament in three weeks, overcame a bogey on the first hole to finish with a birdie and a round of -1 (70).\n\nTwo-time Open Championship winner Padraig Harrington had a tough start but recovered to play the back nine in -1, posting a round of +1.\n\nMcIlroy was not the only player to struggle; Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Tommy Fleetwood, and Bryson DeChambeau collectively shot +18.", "source": {"uri": "sportsjoe.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsJOE.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paddy_morgan@sportsjoe.ie", "name": "Paddy Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1draig_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1draig Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://d1ur8kxvk6cuvz.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/07/343402.jpg?height=720&width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Shane Lowry got past that part.\n\nBut it was his second shot from the right rough that potentially caused him a great deal of angst on Friday afternoon, one that led to a provisional he couldn't use, a ruling, a drop and a double bogey that he was actually happy to achieve.\n\nLowry, the Irishman who won the 2019 British Open at Royal Portrush, put himself in position to get a crack at another Claret Jug this weekend with a second-round 69 that included him bouncing back from near-disaster at the par-4 11th to lead by two over 2013 U.S. Open champion Justin Rose and first-time major participant Daniel Brown.\n\n\"I did the hard part. I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole,\" Lowry said of the tee shot that preceded all the drama.\n\n\"I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\nLowry smother-hooked the shot from the right rough into gorse left of the fairway and behind the spectator line. The ball flew into it and the situation appeared dire. Lowry took a drop, believing his ball would be declared lost. It meant hitting his fourth to the green.\n\n\"Then from there, I hit a great provisional,\" Lowry said. \"The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was O.K. Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\"\n\nAh, but he did. Under Rule 18.3c (3), if the original ball is found, it must be played as it lies. That was not possible, so Lowry needed to take a penalty. The provisional was on longer in use.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes, it was whatever it was, of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing, and I felt like Darren (his caddie) did a great job too just kind of -- he kept telling me, we have loads of time,\" Lowry said. \"We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\nWith his fourth shot after the drop from left of the fairway, Lowry advanced to the front of the green then got up-and-down for double bogey.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6,\" Lowry said. \"It was not like -- it wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nLowry came back to par four straight holes before birdies at the 16th and 18th holes helped him regain those two dropped shots.\n\n\"I think the 12th hole for me was key,\" said Lowry, 37, a six-time winner in Europe and a three-time winner on the PGA tour. \"Twelve was playing very difficult, straight into the wind. I hit driver, 4-iron there, the best shots I've hit all week and made par there. From then on, I felt like it was playing quite difficult, but I felt you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5616,h_3159,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j361fhq910ffc54vf8.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use

It came from the opposite direction to the Irish Sea, with intermittent rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone expected.\n\nTurns out that's not even a big surprise.\n\nDaniel Brown made his major championship debut a memorable one. He birdied two of the last three holes At 6-under 65, one shot ahead of Shane Lowry, he had enough spectators to celebrate his wonderful day in the Scottish twilight.\n\nIt was too dark to photograph his name on the leaderboard, which didn't interest the 29-year-old from England anyway.\n\n\"I'm going to try and put my feet on the ground a little bit and get back to work tomorrow,\" Brown said.\n\nA one-time winner on the European Tour, he arrives at Royal Troon on the back of a seven-straight winless streak dating back to March until two good events. One was the final qualification to qualify for his first major, and the other saw him make the cut at the Scottish Open and finish tied for 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind - yes, it was harsh, but it was different. Scoring on the downwind front nine, the players struggled from start to finish instead of trying to keep it together on the way back.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He scored 78 runs With a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for US Open champion Bryson DeCambeau, who shot 42 for a 76. There were 79 For his highest start at a major after an 80 at the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLori kept the motor all year round, put as well, Soaking in warm applause There were three more laps ahead of him, reminding himself that it was only a good start. But he knew what to expect.\n\n\"Luckily, I got here two weeks ago and I played this wind the second day I played here. I looked at the golf course every wind and I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I think that's a good thing, and it's paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score isn't. He had a 68 - he had a 62 at the Scottish Open last week - and feels he played well because misses are so severely punished at Troon.\n\nIncluded in the group's 69 were reigning PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also went bogey-free at the Open to much acclaim, as he had to endure a 36-hole final qualifier to enter.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scotty Scheffler had it tough after a struggling 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, challenging, especially when you're dealing with rain,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball in the air, it's amazing how short it goes. I think on No. 2 today, I was a little oversloping at 165 and I hit a 5-iron with a grip, which is usually about 205 for me. It went up to 155 and I scratched it.\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from nearly 10 feet and nailed the famous \"postage stamp\" that caused so much damage to the 123-yard hole to 10 feet on the par-3 eighth.\n\nBefore that he made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th A 20-foot birdie putt hole on the 11th 4 to reach under. Lowry finished his round with a 5-under par for his 66.\n\nThe applause grew louder and Lori reminded herself that it was Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason he felt like the crowd was really excited there,\" he said. \"It was late afternoon - there were a few pints of Tennent's in there ... and it felt like the weekend. There's still a lot to do, a few more days to go, so I stayed in my lane and hit some good shots and I was really happy with the way I handled myself.\n\nThomas had played earlier in the day and was 4 under 11. He had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole, requiring a penalty drop, and he missed a 4-foot putt to make double bogey.

They eventually find it, but it leads to the bogey.\n\n\"A little hiccup at the start of the back nine but just be patient and keep plugging away,\" Thomas said.\n\nIn fact, Thomas managed to hold it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th, and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much the wind helped -- a 4-iron off the tee, wedged 25 on the 458-yard closing hole. within feet.\n\nJustin Leonard, who won at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honors of the opening tee shot with a shiny claret jug placed nearby on a podium. He had one 80 in 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nMcIlroy broke 80, but not by much.\n\nHe is hoping for one last chance this year to end his 10-year drought in the majors.

If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days.\"\n\nTwo-time major winner Justin Thomas is lurking at three under, while recently crowned USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is among a group of seven on two under that also includes Justin Rose.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler cut a frustrated figure on the greens but is still in the mix after a one under round that featured four birdies and three bogeys.\n\nMcIlroy was aiming to get over his heartbreak at the US Open last month, where he missed two short putts to blow the lead as Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second major by one shot.\n\nHowever, the Northern Irishman's round, and probably championship, was blown off course at the postage stamp 120-yard eighth.\n\nMcIlroy was unfortunate as his near-perfect tee shot slipped off the green into a bunker, which he took two attempts to escape, to post a double bogey five.\n\nAnother double bogey followed at the 11th. He also dropped shots at the 10th, 15th and 18th.\n\n\"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut,\" said McIlroy.\n\n\"I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more and feel like I have half a chance.\"\n\nWoods wobbles\n\nDeChambeau had been the form player in the majors so far this year, despite his defection to the breakaway LIV Tour.\n\nThe American finished sixth at the Masters and runner-up in the USPGA Championship before claiming his second US Open.\n\nHowever, his struggles with the windy conditions of links golf continued as he was six over par for his opening nine holes.\n\nDeChambeau battled back on the back nine as an eagle on the 17th helped him to a 76.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" said DeChambeau.\n\n\"I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home'. But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\nWorld number three Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three 3-putts today. I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today.\"\n\nCameron Smith, champion at St. Andrews two years ago, fared even worse with an 80.\n\nWorld number four

Open lead as torrid Tiger Woods misses cut", "body": "Troon: Shane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday as a tame Tiger Woods limped to 14 over to miss the cut.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nSign of nerves\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\nHe leads by two shots from Brown, who showed little sign of nerves under the spotlight in his first major, with a steady first 14 holes to sit at five under.\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world No 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nCostly miss\n\nWorld No 1 Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nThe American was not blown off track as the winds strengthened through Friday afternoon with 11 pars in his opening 13 holes before a monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took him within striking range.\n\nHowever, a costly bogey on the last left him still four adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also in the mix after a one over par round was enough to keep him in the top 10 at one under.\n\nWoods' worst ever Open\n\nWoods' tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\n\"I'd like to have played more, but I just wanted to make sure that I was able to play the major championships this year,\" Woods told reporters after his second round the west coast of Scotland.\n\n\"I've gotten better, even though my results really haven't shown it, but physically I've gotten better, which is great.\n\n\"I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again.\"\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score a tie for 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As Lowry prepared to hit his approach shot, he noticed a photographer standing several yards in front of him.\n\n\"There was a cameraman there and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" said Lowry, who is looking for his second major title after winning the 2019 Open Championship.\n\nThe photographer raised his camera, and the movement distracted Lowry, he said, causing him to smother his shot out of the high fescue. His ball shot across the fairway and landed in gorse on the left.\n\nLowry turned his frustration to the photographer, telling him, \"Just get outta the way. Just get back there. F---'s sake.\"\n\n\"I did the hard part,\" Lowry said. \"I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole. I had a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\nLowry informed the R&A rules official walking with his group that he was hitting a provisional shot in case his ball was lost. He hit a new ball onto the green, about 15 feet past the hole.\n\nThat's when the real drama ensued. As Lowry was walking up the fairway, he was informed that a spectator had found his original ball in the gorse. Since his ball wasn't actually lost, he had to take an unplayable lie and identify an acceptable spot to hit from.\n\n\"I hit a great provisional,\" Lowry said. \"The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then or you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, you didn't have to go and identify it.\"\n\nLowry asked for a second official to confirm the ruling. After a 20-minute delay, he took a one-stroke penalty for an unplayable lie and dropped his original ball on trampled rough, two club lengths from the previous spot in the gorse bush. His view of the 11th green was obstructed, and his fourth shot landed short of the green. Lowry two-putted from 33 feet.\n\nThe double-bogey 6 dropped Lowry into a first-place tie with Brown at 5 under.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing,\" Lowry said. \"I felt like [caddie] Darren [Reynolds] did a great job too. He kept telling me, 'We have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.'\"\n\nLowry carded pars on each of the next four holes. He reached the par-5 16th green in two shots and two-putted from 58 feet for a birdie. A 20\u00bd-foot birdie on the par-4 18th extended his lead over Brown to two shots.\n\n\"I felt like I went out there, I was in control of my ball [and] did all the right things for a lot of the round,\" Lowry said. \"Then when I got in a bit of trouble, I feel like I really finished the round well. I'm pretty happy with the day. To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here, it's why we're here.\"\n\nRose, who finished second in 2018 at Carnoustie Golf Links, had to go through final qualifying to make the field this year. He is making the most of his opportunity, carding a 3-under 68 on Friday, including a 41\u00bd-footer on No. 18 to get to 5 under and tie Brown for second.\n\nIt's Rose's best 36-hole position in a major since he had a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the 2021 Masters. He finished seventh at Augusta National that year.\n\nAn Englishman hasn't won The Open since Nick Faldo in 1992. When Rose captured the 2013 U.S. Open, he was the first golfer from England to do it since Tony Jacklin in 1970.\n\n\"Those are nice moments when it comes together and you can share the story of what it means, but you're never thinking of it, and we are pretty selfish from that point of view,\" Rose said. \"Like we want it for us, and obviously it's great to share it with everybody that it's meaningful to, but in the moment you're just trying to get the job done.\"\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler was five shots behind Lowry after posting a 1-under 70 for the second straight round. Scheffler's caddie, Ted Scott, labored through the round after battling a stomach illness Thursday night. He was seen lying on the ground and sitting between holes Friday.\n\n\"He seemed to feel better as the day went on,\" Scheffler said. \"The doc here took good care of him, but he did not sleep very much last night apparently. We didn't know if he was going to be able to go this morning, but he fought it out. You saw him laying down probably quite a bit out there, which was pretty funny.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schlabach@espn.co.uk", "name": "Mark Schlabach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-stroke engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Jacklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tony Jacklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnoustie_Golf_Links", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnoustie Golf Links"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Faldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Faldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0719%2Fr1360573_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Playing in the tougher tee time window in both rounds, Rose went 29 holes before his first bogey and has just one bogey through 36 holes.\n\nLowry, the 2019 Open Champion, shot 69 to jump Brown for the solo second-round lead Friday. He did it despite a dramatic double-bogey on the 11th hole that included disagreements with R&A officials and a 20-minute delay.\n\nLowry, coming off a first-round 66 in which he led the field in putting, led the tournament in ball striking Friday with five birdies. The Irishman attacked pins all day and took the lead despite missing three putts inside 10 feet.\n\nJust behind him are Rose and 29-year-old English journeyman Brown, who shot a 1-over-par 72 to stay in a strong position after a first-round leading 65 on Thursday. Brown, ranked No. 272 in the world, entered the Scottish Open last week coming off six straight missed cuts. He finished 61st last week, but now he's in the final group at The Open.\n\nLowry entered that 11th hole 7 under with a two-shot lead, but when hitting his second shot from a good lie in the rough, he shanked it into the thick gorse bushes and hit a provisional.\n\n\"I hit a great provisional. The referee asked me going down, 'Did I want to find my first one?'\" Lowry recalled. \"And I said no. So I assumed that was okay. Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\"\n\nAfter 20 minutes of deliberation, Lowry finally took his unplayable lie penalty and hit his shot. He double bogeyed the hole.\n\nR&A rules official Charlie Maran explained: \"You can declare a ball lost, but when it's actually found, it is the ball in play. The provisional ball that he did play now becomes a wrong ball. So, he has to take his options with his original ball.\"\n\nLowry then finished with birdies on 16 and 18 to regain the solo lead into the weekend.\n\nBilly Horschel had only one career major top-10 finish entering 2024. He then finished T8 at the PGA Championship in May, and Friday he shot a bogey-free 68 to put himself in the mix. He's tied for fourth with LIV golfer Dean Burmester and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who has shot consecutive 70s to stay afloat.\n\nTiger Woods finished 14 over but still committed to playing in The Open next year, in addition to the other majors. He said he will not play again until his Hero World Challenge event in the Bahamas in November.\n\nMany other top stars missed the cut at Royal Troon, which closed at 6 over par.

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Former Lenoir-Rhyne administrator talks about diversity, inclusion at university\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to

If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days.\"\n\nTwo-time major winner Justin Thomas is lurking at three under, while recently crowned USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is among a group of seven on two under that also includes Justin Rose.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler cut a frustrated figure on the greens but is still in the mix after a one under round that featured four birdies and three bogeys.\n\nMcIlroy was aiming to get over his heartbreak at the US Open last month, where he missed two short putts to blow the lead as Bryson DeChambeau claimed his second major by one shot.\n\nHowever, the Northern Irishman's round, and probably championship, was blown off course at the postage stamp 120-yard eighth.\n\nMcIlroy was unfortunate as his near-perfect tee shot slipped off the green into a bunker, which he took two attempts to escape, to post a double bogey five.\n\nAnother double bogey followed at the 11th. He also dropped shots at the 10th, 15th and 18th.\n\n\"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut,\" said McIlroy.\n\n\"I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more and feel like I have half a chance.\"\n\nDeChambeau had been the form player in the majors so far this year, despite his defection to the breakaway LIV Tour.\n\nThe American finished sixth at the Masters and runner-up in the USPGA Championship before claiming his second US Open.\n\nHowever, his struggles with the windy conditions of links golf continued as he was six over par for his opening nine holes.\n\nDeChambeau battled back on the back nine as an eagle on the 17th helped him to a 76.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" said DeChambeau.\n\n\"I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home'. But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\nWorld No. 3 Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three three-putts today. I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today.\"\n\nCameron Smith, champion at St. Andrews two years ago, fared even worse with an 80.\n\nWorld No. 4 Ludvig Aberg was another of the big names to falter in his first ever round at a British Open with a four-over round of 75.

It came from the opposite direction off the Irish Sea, accompanied by occasional rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone was expecting.\n\nTurns out that wasn't even the biggest surprise.\n\nDaniel Brown made his major championship debut a memorable one. He birdied two of the last three holes for a 6-under 65, giving him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry with just enough spectators left in the Scottish twilight to celebrate his amazing day.\n\nIt was getting too dark to take a photo of his name atop the leaderboard, and that doesn't interest the 29-year-old from England, anyway.\n\n\"I'm going to try and keep my feet on the ground a bit and take on the job again tomorrow,\" Brown said.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keep it together on the way back, it was tough from start to finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 79 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 69 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most.

I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with how things have gone. The job tomorrow is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.\"\n\nExplained: Lowry's double-bogey chaos at the 11th\n\nLowry held a two-shot advantage when he sent his tee shot at the 11th into the rough, but he felt he had \"done the hard part\" on the hole named \"The Railway\" due to its proximity to the train line.\n\nHe was distracted by a cameraman and pulled it way left into a bush, then hit his fourth shot to around 10 feet before his original ball was found by a spectator and made the provisional void.\n\nThere was a lengthy delay to decide where Lowry would take his drop, where he then finished short of the green with his approach and needed to get up and down to limit the damage.\n\n\"I hit a great provisional,\" Lowry said. \"The referee asked me going down [the fairway] did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was okay. Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it.\n\n\"I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't. [But] through that whole process of 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop, I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And I felt like Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too, he kept telling me that we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\"\n\nLowry holds a two-shot lead over Brown, who stayed in contention with a one-over 72, while Justin Rose and world No 1 Scottie Scheffler are among the chasing pack heading into the final two rounds.\n\n\"I'm not sure Scottie Scheffler is too worried about anyone with the form he's in,\" Lowry joked. \"He's obviously on the leaderboard, and he's one person that people are going to be talking about. There's some other guys there as well.\n\n\"I see Justin Rose going well, and this guy Daniel Brown, I've never played with him, but obviously he had a great day yesterday and looks to be going all right today. I think if I give myself a chance on Sunday, I know I can do it. That's as good a position to be in as any.\"", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/768x432/skysports-shane-lowry-golf_6632189.jpg?20240719164626", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score a tie for 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nkca/jc", "source": {"uri":

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I felt through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And Darren (Reynolds, his caddie) did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nBrown might have been expected to come back down to earth with a bump after his Thursday heroics, but the 29-year-old from Northallerton delivered an impressive sequel on his major debut.\n\n\"I've always been quite laid back really,\" Brown said. \"I think I am a bit of a realist as well.\n\n\"I know I'm not going to start getting ahead of myself and thinking, 'Oh my God, I'm leading the Open' or 'I'm second in the Open' or whatever.\n\n\"There's still 36 holes left. I might have a good round tomorrow and then I might have a stinky round on Sunday. You just don't know.\"\n\nRose's round drew high praise from six-time major winner Sir Nick Faldo, the last English winner of the Open in 1992, during a commentary stint on Sky Sports.\n\n\"Maybe the best 68 of his whole career on a day like today in this wind,\" Faldo said.\n\nSpeaking about his chance to make history, Rose said: \"When I won the US Open (in 2013) it was like 'First since Tony Jacklin' and they are nice moments when they come together, but you are never thinking of it.\n\n\"In the moment you are just trying to get the job done.\"\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel and Dean Burmester were five shots off the lead on two under par, with Jason Day, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Corey Conners all one under.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Fri

I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole,\" Lowry said of the 11, which runs parallel to railroad tracks. \"I had a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right [by a cameraman] just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\n'Just get back there!' Open leader Shane Lowry gets off rails at 11 with lengthy, crazy double\n\nLowry was leading The Open by two shots until he ran into trouble at the 11th hole.\n\nLowry's shot wasn't just left; it landed in the gorse. Fearing it lost, he hit a provisional ball onto the green. When asked if he wanted to search for the wayward shot or take the penalty and play the provisional, he told the official not to look for the ball.\n\n\"Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So, apparently you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it,\" said Lowry, who was forced to play his original ball and eventually took a penalty drop after a complicated ruling that took nearly 20 minutes.\n\nLowry made a double bogey on No. 11 to fall into a share of the lead with Daniel Brown, but it was how he responded to that miscue that gave him confidence the rest of the round.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" he said. \"I think the 12th hole, for me, was key. [No.] 12 was playing very difficult, straight into the wind. I hit driver, 4-iron there, too, the best shots I've hit all week, to about 30 feet and made par there. From then on, I felt like [the wind being] down out of the left coming in, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nLowry played his last seven holes in 2 under, including a birdie at No. 18, for a 69 and two-stroke lead at 7 under over Brown (72) and Justin Rose (68).", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irishman_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Irishman (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/lBCCwMnhMZCjeG07cqMHQA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_golf_channel_404/08c2c0648142cc55ade9493b78c3704c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

takes British Open lead as McIlroy, Woods miss cut", "body": "Rory McIlroy's decade-long wait for a major goes on after missing the cut at the British Open\n\nShane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday as Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods were among the star names to miss the cut.\n\nOnly 10 of the 154 players left in the field are under par as the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast wreaked havoc with five of the world's top 10 failing to make the weekend.\n\nLowry leads by two from Justin Rose, who came through qualifying to book his place in Troon, and unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown on his major debut.\n\nThe Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\n\"To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here,\" said Lowry.\n\n\"The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday.\"\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nA monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took the American within striking range before a costly bogey on the last left him still five adrift of Lowry.\n\nMore from this section Trump Says He Would Let Fed Chair Jerome Powell

major will extend into 2025 at least after a disastrous two days to finish on 11 over.\n\nThe world number two needed an under par round after shooting 78 on Thursday but carded a triple bogey eight at the fourth in a run of six dropped shots in four holes.\n\nWoods was one of the few players to finish below McIlroy on 14 over after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\n\"I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again,\" he said.\n\nThe three-time British Open champion's score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and was his poorest at this event by three shots.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, Ludvig Aberg, Wyndham Clark and Viktor Hovland were the other top-10 players to miss the cut.\n\nThey were joined by 2022 champion Cam Smith, Tommy Fleetwood and Sahith Theegala.\n\nScottish Open champion Bob MacIntyre bounced back from dropping eight shots in his first four holes to sneak into the weekend at five over.\n\nkca/ea/nr", "source":

I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years'. No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nLowry's closest challenge came from Brown, playing in the penultimate group, who charged up the leaderboard after carding a front-nine 34 and then adding successive birdies from the tenth to get within one of the lead.\n\nBrown got up and down from a tough lie at the par-five 16th to make a birdie to move alongside Lowry, before grabbing the solo advantage after rolling in from eight feet to pick up a shot at the last - in near-darkness - and move to six under.\n\nTwo-time PGA champion Justin Thomas set the initial target after a birdie-birdie finish gave him a three-under 68, leaving him three strokes back in third, while Alex Noren, Justin Rose and reigning PGA champion Xander Schauffele are among the group in tied-fourth on two under.\n\nWorld No 1 Scottie Scheffler began his bid for a seventh victory in 11 starts with a one-under 70, leaving him in the group tied-11th also containing five-time major champion Brooks Koepka, Matt Fitzpatrick and Matt Wallace, with just 17 of the 158 players ending the day under par.\n\nDeChambeau needed a 55-foot eagle at the par-five 16th to stay within 11 shots of the lead, while McIlroy admitted his focus was simply making the cut rather than challenging for the Claret Jug after carding one of the highest opening rounds of his major career.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, having double-bogeyed the Postage Stamp as part of five dropped shots in four holes, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nWoods made a great start when he holed a long-range putt for a birdie at the third, only to add just one more in a round containing six bogeys and two double bogeys. The 48-year-old faces a quick turnaround ahead of his Friday morning tee times, where he admitted he would need to shoot in the mid-60s to have a chance of making the cut.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/1600x900/skysports-golf-daniel-brown_6631266.jpg?20240718215630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Lowry shared the 36-hole lead when he won at Portrush in 2019.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to have a very late tee time tomorrow. I'm not going to be playing for another 24 hours. I know what that's about,\" Lowry said. \"I know tomorrow is going to be a long day, but I've done it before.\n\n\"For me, it's just about going out and playing my own game, shooting the best score I can. Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff.\"\n\nIt was best to keep blinders on at Royal Troon. There were some harrowing scenes.\n\nJustin Thomas, who opened with a 68 to get himself in the mix, shot a 45 on the front nine and played his best golf from there to salvage a 78 and make sure he at least made the cut.\n\nRobert MacIntyre had an even tougher start. Scotland's biggest star after winning his national Open last week, MacIntyre was stuck in pot bunkers and high grass. He was 8 over for his round through four holes -- four holes! -- and then put together a big fight on the back nine in a bid to make the weekend.\n\nAguri Iwasaki had them all beat. He took a 9 on consecutive holes and shot 52 on the back nine for a 91. One of those 9s was on the par-3 14th, where he took four shots out of two bunkers and once had to go backward toward the fairway.\n\nTiger Woods missed another cut in a major -- that was one of the few surprises because he opened with a 79 -- but left his mark by tying his own mark with his highest 36-hole score as a pro with 156. The only time he had a higher 36-hole score was at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a senior in high school.\n\nWoods had company in leaving early. Rory McIlroy, who started with a 78, needed a good start and got a triple bogey on the par-5 fourth hole. He barely moved it from high grass, chipped from more rough into a bunker and missed a 4-foot putt.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler missed all that calamity. He put together another steady round of 70 -- three birdies, two bogeys and the rest pars -- and joined the group at 2-under 140. He was five shots behind Lowry as he chases his second major of the year.\n\nJoaquin Niemann of Chile managed another 71 despite taking a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 eighth hole -- the Postage Stamp -- that measures a mere 123 yards. He was in three bunkers around the tiny green and three-putted when he finally got out of them. Niemann also made six birdies in a most remarkable round of level par.\n\nSo much chaos across the century-old links, and it looked for a brief moment like Lowry might take part. It took so long to play the 11th hole that Jordan Spieth in the group behind him walked over to the side of the fairway and sat down near a gorse bush to wait.\n\nLowry at least kept it in play, though it was in the rough to the right. He was distracted by a photographer and angry at himself for not backing off the shot that he tugged left toward a clump of gorse.\n\nFiguring it would be lost in the prickly mess, Lowry hit a provisional for a lost ball onto the green, a terrific shot. One problem. Someone found the ball. It was no longer lost, so the provisional ball was not in play.\n\nLowry took a penalty drop from the bush, going back to find a place where he had a swing, put it short of the green, chipped on and salvaged a double bogey 6.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" Lowry said.\n\nHe made five birdies on the day, and yet nothing felt better than a par. That came on the 12th, one of the toughest holes into the wind. He hit driver and 4-iron to 30 feet, two putts for a most beautiful, calming par.\n\n\"The best shots I've hit all week,\" Lowry said. \"From then on, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAnd now comes a big opportunity for Lowry to reclaim that claret jug, for Rose to become the first player in the modern era of exemptions to come through 36-hole qualifying, and for Brown to become one of the biggest surprises since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.\n\nAnd so many others are very much in the mix, starting with Scheffler, golf's best player.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Hill_Club_and_Lodge", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay Hill Club and Lodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_St_George's_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal St George's Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Curtis_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Curtis (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/OnqUlugjzgNAGVDTri5x9QJpzLQ=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/TVZIAPNMJWZWHW4PGR2J5FHZB4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It came from the opposite direction off the Irish Sea, accompanied by occasional rain, and made Royal Troon a tougher test than anyone was expecting.\n\nTurns out that wasn't even the biggest surprise.\n\nDaniel Brown made his major championship debut a memorable one. He birdied two of the last three holes for a 6-under 65, giving him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry with just enough spectators left in the Scottish twilight to celebrate his amazing day.\n\nIt was getting too dark to take a photo of his name atop the leaderboard, and that doesn't interest the 29-year-old from England, anyway.\n\n\"I'm going to try and keep my feet on the ground a bit and take on the job again tomorrow,\" Brown said.\n\nPeople are also reading...

One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nBut this day was all about the wind -- yes, it was fierce, but it was different. Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only a good start and three more rounds were ahead of him. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nMcIlroy broke 80, but not by much.\n\nHe was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now McIlroy only wants to make it to the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "siouxcityjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sioux City Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodbury_County,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Woodbury County, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Woodbury County, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_City,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sioux City, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa_Great_Lakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa Great Lakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_High_School_(Sioux_City,_Iowa)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West High School (Sioux City, Iowa)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_29", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interstate 29"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Lowry shared the 36-hole lead when he won at Portrush in 2019.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to have a very late tee time tomorrow. I'm not going to be playing for another 24 hours. I know what that's about,\" Lowry said. \"I know tomorrow is going to be a long day, but I've done it before.\n\n\"For me, it's just about going out and playing my own game, shooting the best score I can. Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff.\"\n\nIt was best to keep blinders on at Royal Troon. There were some harrowing scenes.\n\nJustin Thomas, who opened with a 68 to get himself in the mix, shot a 45 on the front nine and played his best golf from there to salvage a 78 and make sure he at least made the cut.\n\nRobert MacIntyre had an even tougher start. Scotland's biggest star after winning his national Open last week, MacIntyre was stuck in pot bunkers and high grass. He was 8 over for his round through four holes -- four holes! -- and then put together a big fight on the back nine in a bid to make the weekend.\n\nAguri Iwasaki had them all beat. He took a 9 on consecutive holes and shot 52 on the back nine for a 91. One of those 9s was on the par-3 14th, where he took four shots out of two bunkers and once had to go backward toward the fairway.\n\nTiger Woods missed another cut in a major -- that was one of the few surprises because he opened with a 79 -- but left his mark by tying his own mark with his highest 36-hole score as a pro with 156. The only time he had a higher 36-hole score was at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a senior in high school.\n\nWoods had company in leaving early. Rory McIlroy, who started with a 78, needed a good start and got a triple bogey on the par-5 fourth hole. He barely moved it from high grass, chipped from more rough into a bunker and missed a 4-foot putt.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler missed all that calamity. He put together another steady round of 70 -- three birdies, two bogeys and the rest pars -- and joined the group at 2-under 140. He was five shots behind Lowry as he chases his second major of the year.\n\nJoaquin Niemann of Chile managed another 71 despite taking a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 eighth hole -- the Postage Stamp -- that measures a mere 123 yards. He was in three bunkers around the tiny green and three-putted when he finally got out of them. Niemann also made six birdies in a most remarkable round of level par.\n\nSo much chaos across the century-old links, and it looked for a brief moment like Lowry might take part. It took so long to play the 11th hole that Jordan Spieth in the group behind him walked over to the side of the fairway and sat down near a gorse bush to wait.\n\nLowry at least kept it in play, though it was in the rough to the right. He was distracted by a photographer and angry at himself for not backing off the shot that he tugged left toward a clump of gorse.\n\nFiguring it would be lost in the prickly mess, Lowry hit a provisional for a lost ball onto the green, a terrific shot. One problem. Someone found the ball. It was no longer lost, so the provisional ball was not in play.\n\nLowry took a penalty drop from the bush, going back to find a place where he had a swing, put it short of the green, chipped on and salvaged a double bogey 6.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" Lowry said.\n\nHe made five birdies on the day, and yet nothing felt better than a par. That came on the 12th, one of the toughest holes into the wind. He hit driver and 4-iron to 30 feet, two putts for a most beautiful, calming par.\n\n\"The best shots I've hit all week,\" Lowry said. \"From then on, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAnd now comes a big opportunity for Lowry to reclaim that claret jug, for Rose to become the first player in the modern era of exemptions to come through 36-hole qualifying, and for Brown to become one of the biggest surprises since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.\n\nAnd so many others are very much in the mix, starting with Scheffler, golf's best player.\n\n\"I've played two solid rounds and it put me five shots back, and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts,\" Scheffler said, making it all sound so simple on a day when nothing felt easy.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Hill_Club_and_Lodge", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay Hill Club and Lodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_St_George's_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal St George's Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Curtis_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Curtis (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/sZr-lEoaKUugWCEviK7bQokP-5I=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/NTW23ZJ7KCWQXIY2Y2Q3WA6RKA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I felt through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on.

It was late in the afternoon and a few pints of Tennent's were had out there. It felt more like the weekend.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\n\n\"The walk down 18 was actually pretty cool. I said to Billy Foster (Matt Fitzpatrick's caddie) that it's the greatest walk in golf and I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house. That's the plan, to try to get to do that again.\n\n\"I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again and that's why I'm here this week.\n\n\"No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nA downbeat McIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven over par, 12 behind his great friend Lowry.\n\nAccording to statistician Justin Ray, lead data analyst at KPMG Performance Insights, 87 per cent of Open winners since 1960 have been within four shots of the lead after the first round.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old, who agonisingly missed out the US Open title last month, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second US Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 included a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth, where he could only advance his second shot a few yards from heavy rough before hitting his next onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\nThomas had set the early clubhouse target on three under par thanks to birdies on the 17th and 18th, the two-time major winner's 68 representing a 14-shot improvement on his opening round at Hoylake last year.\n\n\"I couldn't even tell you what I was thinking or how it was then,\" Thomas said when asked to compare the two rounds.\n\n\"I'm just worried about how I am now, and I'm very pleased with my game and know things are continuing to work in the right direction.\"\n\nFormer supermarket delivery driver Joe Dean was part of a seven-way tie for fourth place on two under par which included US PGA winner Xander Schauffele and Ryder Cup team-mates Nicolai Hojgaard and Justin Rose.\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in a bogey-free 69.", "source": {"uri": "ayradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He lets you know when he's crying in the Carnoustie car park in 2018 as \"golf wasn't my friend at the time,\" just like he runs along the gallery in Rome riling up European crowds and exchanging expletives with Joe LaCava at the Ryder Cup. He tells you when he feels like he can't make a putt for his life, and he tells you when you're in his way.\n\nShane Lowry is golf's great open vein. He's a big-bearded, 225-pound Irishman with a career of monumental highs and sickening lows whose vulnerability is his greatest calling card and the trait that might rub some the wrong way.\n\nSo there's Shane Lowry, shanking a ball deep into Royal Troon's wicked gorse bushes on the 11th hole and immediately unleashing on a cameraman.\n\n\"As I was over the ball, I could just see you with the f -- ing camera up!\" Lowry frustratedly told the cameraman. \"Just get back there! (Expletive) sake!\"\n\nAt that moment, the 152nd Open Championship could have gotten away from him. After somebody found the ball he certainly didn't want to find, after a lengthy disagreement with officials over whether he could use his provisional, after a delay that lasted closer to 30 minutes than 20 and held up the tournament, Lowry's two-shot lead evaporated with a double bogey. Suddenly, he was tied with Englishman Dan Brown going into the difficult back nine.\n\nBut there was that emotion again. Lowry walked off the 18th green with a fist in the air as his 20-foot putt fell. The 37-year-old closed with birdies on 16 and 18 to enter the weekend with a two-shot lead while fighting for his second Claret Jug.\n\nSo a reporter asked Lowry a simple question: \"Are you a good frontrunner?\"\n\nLowry paused for a few moments.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a good runner,\" he countered to a room full of hearty laughs.\n\nThe contrasts between Lowry's high and low emotions match well with the rollercoaster elements of his career. He's gone from being dismissed as Rory McIlroy's lifelong sidekick to becoming a two-time Ryder Cupper deserving your respect. He collapsed at the 2016 U.S. Open, giving away a two-shot lead with a Sunday 76, but he also ran away with the 2019 Open Championship at Royal Portrush. During stretches of a great 2022 season, DataGolf ranked him No. 7 in the world. Ten months later, he dropped to No. 67, causing many to want him off the Ryder Cup team.\n\nWhen he teamed up with McIlroy again at the Zurich Classic in April, they were two golfers in need of a reset. McIlroy was tense and having a tough start to the year. Lowry was in a horrible putting slump ranking toward the bottom of the field each week. The duo won the PGA Tour's lone team event that week in New Orleans, and even then, amid the celebration, Lowry somberly implied that McIlroy carried him to victory.\n\nSince then, though, Lowry has reminded the world he is one of golf's great survivors. He tied the all-time major record with a Saturday 62 at the PGA Championship to finish T6. He went T19 at the U.S. Open and shot another 62 at the Travelers before finishing T9.\n\nLowry is lovable. He's funny and good with fans and would go to war for his mates. He also runs a little hot, the way we saw with the cameraman Friday or at the Ryder Cup in Rome. Nobody is just one thing, and viewers should enjoy the ride that is Shane Lowry at the Open Championship. If you do, you will see creativity and emotion and pure links golf at its best.\n\nYou will have fun.\n\n\"I can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot-headed at times,\" Lowry said, \"but I really feel like that's why I've had the career I've had. I've spoken to people, my coach and my team about this at times, and if I go out there and try to be somebody I'm not, you're just not going to be successful. That's how I feel.\"'\n\nWhat bodes well for Lowry is that he's in this two-shot lead playing two opposite rounds. Thursday, he shot 66 thanks to an epic day with his putter. He didn't aim at pins or make highlight-reel shots. He generally kept himself out of trouble, put himself in position and led the field in putting.\n\nSo on Friday, Lowry had better control of his swing and instead led the morning wave in strokes gained in approach. Aside from the mess he made of No. 11, Lowry hit sick iron shots while controlling the ball through Troon's difficult winds and left himself constant birdie chances. If anything, Lowry left many shots out there -- he lost strokes putting.\n\nHe went out in 34 before his second shot went into that gorse on the par-4 11th. Lowry said an official asked him if he wanted to find the ball and Lowry declared no, in his eyes meaning it was settled and he'd play his provisional. That provisional was up on the green, at a makeable distance for bogey.\n\n\"Then we get down there, and somebody had found it,\" Lowry recalled \"So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\nR&A rules official Charlie Maran said: \"You can declare a ball lost, but when it's actually found, it is the ball in play.The provisional ball that he did play now becomes a wrong ball. So, he has to take his options with his original ball.\"\n\nLowry actually took pride in the way he stayed calm throughout the endeavor. He walked over to the 12th fairway and settled down. When it was over, he said he was happy to get out of there with a 6 and continue his round. He played the final seven holes in 2-under par.\n\nThere is a long way to go at this Open Championship, and every player in the field will be well aware of world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler lurking at 2-under, but Lowry has a chance to change the way we discuss his career.\n\nIt would be extremely dismissive to call Lowry a one-hit wonder. He is not. A win this week certainly cements Lowry as one of the great competitors in European golf. It would mean two Claret Jugs on top of two Ryder Cups and 19 major finishes of T25 or better.\n\nYet Lowry is the one downplaying any such talk. Saturday is going to be a long day of waiting for the field trying to catch him. His goal is to ignore it.\n\n\"Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

He birdied two of the last three holes Thursday in the British Open, giving him a 6-under 65 with just enough spectators still left in the twilight of Royal Troon to celebrate with him.\n\nIt gave him a one-shot lead over Shane Lowry, who played bogey-free for a 66 and his best start in 46 majors.\n\nLowry at least knew what to expect with an opposite wind that seemed to catch just about everyone off guard. He came to Troon two weeks ago and knew what to expect, and it paid off handsomely for the Irishman.\n\nThe surprise was Brown.\n\nA one-time winner on the European tour, he arrived at Royal Troon having failed to make the cut in seven straight tournaments dating to March until a couple of good events. One was the final qualifying to earn a spot in his first major, the other at the Scottish Open when he made the cut and finished 61st.\n\nPeople are also reading... $400K in unpaid bills for grapes lead to slew of lawsuits against Napa winemaker Customers are raving about Moulin -- downtown Napa's new caf\u00e9 and bakery Ryan Seacrest's Napa County home up for sale at $22 million Letter: Concerns about St. Helena Agritourism Initiative Napa City Council to weigh selling land for downtown development Fight between Le Petit Elephant and Alta Heights neighbors gets personal Mount Veeder vineyard owners sue own lawyers over money tied to Tubbs Fire Napa City Council votes to sell Dwight Murray Plaza, other downtown land to developers Hank McGraw, onetime baseball phenom turned maverick and late-life Napan, dead at 81 Why is that?

Instead of players trying to make a score on the downwind front nine and keeping it together on the way back, it was tough from start-to-finish.\n\nRory McIlroy certainly found that to be the case. He shot 78 with a pair of double bogeys. Ditto for U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, who went out in 42 on his way to a 76. Every major is tough on 48-year-old Tiger Woods, who had a 78 for his highest start in a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nLowry motored along, putting as well as he has all year, soaking up the warm applause all while reminding himself it was only one day. But he sure knew what to expect.\n\n\"Fortunately enough, I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nJustin Thomas is off to another great start for the second straight week in Scotland, even if his score doesn't look that way. He had a 68 -- he shot 62 last week in the Scottish Open -- and feels as though he played better because the misses are more severely punished at Troon.\n\nThe group at 68 included PGA champion Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose, who also played bogey-free with greater appreciation of this Open because he had to endure 36-hole final qualifying just to get in.\n\nThrow in the occasional rain, and Masters champion Scottie Scheffler found it plenty difficult after battling his way to a 70.\n\n\"I don't know if confusing is the right word, just challenging, especially when you get the rain involved,\" Scheffler said. \"When you get a wet ball into the wind, it's amazing how short it goes. I think it was No. 2 today, I had 165 to the pin off a slight upslope, and I hit a hold 5-iron, which for me usually goes about 205. It went probably 155 at the most. And I striped it.\"\n\nLowry, the Open champion at Royal Portrush five years ago, hit his stride around the turn. He birdied the seventh from about 10 feet and hit wedge to 10 feet at the par-3 eighth, the famed \"Postage Stamp\" that caused so much damage for a 123-yard hole.\n\nHe also made two big pars, including a 25-foot putt on the 10th, before holing a 20-foot birdie putt on the 11th to reach 4 under. Lowry ended his round with a wedge to 5 feet for his 66.\n\nThe applause kept getting louder, and Lowry kept reminding himself it was only Thursday.\n\n\"For some reason I felt like he crowd were getting very excited out there,\" he said. \"It was late in the afternoon -- a few pints of Tennents were had out there ... and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nThomas played earlier in the day and was at 4 under through 11. He just had to work hard to keep a good score on his card.\n\nHis tee shot landed in a bush on the tough 12th hole that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Leonard, a winner at Royal Troon in 1997, returned for the first time since 2016 and was given the honor of the opening tee shot with the shiny claret jug positioned nearby on a podium. He had an 80, one of 12 rounds of 80 or higher.\n\nThat included John Daly, who made 8 on the last hole. It also included Cameron Smith, the Open champion from two years ago at St. Andrews.\n\nThe back is longer and typically plays into a strong wind. It was the opposite direction for the early going and still caused its share of problems.\n\nIt was a nightmare for McIlroy, who was hopeful of one last chance this year to end his drought in the majors that dates 10 years. Now he's hopeful of sticking around for the weekend. He took two to get of a bunker on the Postage Stamp, and then sent his drive on the 11th over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds. He couldn't solve the wind.\n\n\"You play your practice rounds, and you try to come up with a strategy that you think is going to get you around the golf course. Then when the wind is like that other options present themselves, and you start to second guess yourself a little bit,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job.\"\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to

I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry told reporters on his return to the clubhouse.\n\n\"As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, (it was) my own fault.\"\n\nThe drama continued when Lowry struck a \"great\" provisional shot - taken when a ball is presumed lost outside a penalty area or out of bounds - to within 12 feet of the hole, only for one eagle-eyed fan to subsequently find his original ball and void his provisional effort in the process.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion with a rules official regarding where to take a drop from, the 37-year-old golfer eventually left with a double bogey - enough to erase his two-shot cushion, but \"not a disaster\", he later reflected.\n\nIf Lowry had lost his cool, he quickly found it in abundance. After rebounding with four steady pars, the Irishman signed off with his second birdie in three holes to restore the gap to English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown heading into the weekend.\n\nAs he seeks to turn back the clock to his dominant triumph at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland five years ago, Lowry has no intention of throttling the passion that helped him clinch his sole major to date.\n\n\"I can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot headed at times, but I really feel like that's why I've had the career I've had,\" Lowry, who has nine combined wins on the PGA Tour and European Tour, said.\n\n\"If I go out there and try to be somebody I'm not, you're just not going to be successful ... [But] If I go out there and be myself, I feel like I can do very well. So allowing myself to do that, without getting in your own way.\"\n\nIt was an entirely contrasting day for Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, as the world No. 2 capitulated to become the highest profile casualty of a host of big names that failed to make the cut.\n\nThe 35-year-old star had been out to exorcise the demons of his latest heartbreaking major near-miss at the US Open last month but found only more woe at Royal Troon, finishing 11-over par overall to fall well short of the top-70 players and ties that progressed to the weekend.\n\nNeeding a fast start after a grueling first round 78, McIlroy's hopes of making the cut were effectively extinguished by the end of the sixth hole after a nightmarish stretch. Having bogeyed the third, McIlroy triple bogeyed the following par-five hole before back-to-back bogeys.\n\nA solid back nine saw him go two-under par down the stretch but the damage was done, his closing 75 ensuring his wait for a fifth major will continue into an 11 year.\n\nOnce I made the eight on the 4th hole, that was it. 22 holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week,\" McIlroy admitted to reporters.\n\n\"It was a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that, but at least I played okay and at least feel like, when the wind dropped, my game felt a little more comfortable and I hit some good shots.\"\n\nTiger Woods will also be absent from the weekend, resigning him to a third consecutive missed major cut for just the second time in his career.\n\nThe 48-year-old shot 79 and 77 to finish on 14-over par, the joint-highest 36-hole score he has ever recorded at a major, but insisted he still enjoyed the challenge.\n\n\"I've always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,\" Woods, who added he will \"definitely\" compete at next year's Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, told reporters Friday.\n\n\"Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn't as sharp as I needed to be.

No one seemed ready for the wind to blow from an entirely different direction.\n\n\"Hitting driver on 1 in the practice round wasn't really great prep for today,\" said Xander Schauffele, who needed 3-iron, 6-iron instead, \"but that's just kind of how links golf is, and that's the beauty of it.\"\n\nPlaying into an opposite wind was a puzzle that few players had the answers to unless your name happened to be Daniel Brown, not the Da Vinci Code author, but the golfer making his major championship debut, who shot 65 and leads by one over 2019 Open champ Shane Lowry.

Last year, it was amateur Christo Lamprecht; this time, Daniel Brown, a 29-year-old English golfer who plays on the DP World Tour, grabbed the lead with an 8-foot birdie on 18 to shoot 6-under 65.\n\n\"Yeah, amazing, isn't it?\" said Brown, who had his brother, Ben, on the bag. \"I was nervous on the 1st tee, obviously it being my first major, but I hit a few nice shots early, so I kind of got settled into the round pretty quick.\"\n\nRanked No. 272 in the world, Brown won his maiden title last year ISPS Handa World Invitational. In all three of his PGA Tour starts in his career, he's opened with 65. But even Brown probably didn't see a round like this coming: His last eight DP World Tour starts included six missed cuts, a WD and a 61st-place finish.\n\nAt the par-3, fifth hole, with the wind howling, Brown was asked if he tried to cut his 3-iron to the flag, which ended 2 feet from the hole. \"No, I pulled it,\" he admitted, but it was a tap-in birdie.\n\nBrown took advantage of more benign conditions playing late in the day. At No. 11, he drained a 42-foot birdie. \"I felt good all day, really, with the putter,\" he said.\n\nFrom the deep rough at 16, he tacked on another birdie and then broke a tie with Lowry with his birdie at the last.\n\n\"He took advantage of the conditions coming home,\" Golf Channel's Notah Begay III said. \"After missing so many cuts and not playing great golf coming in, you know this game can come up at any moment and bite you. We've all been there. He knows he put up a great round, celebrate it for a very brief moment, but I promise he will show up ready to play tomorrow, knowing that he hasn't been on the greatest streak of golf coming in.\"\n\nShane Lowry locked in on the greens\n\nShane Lowry hits his tee shot on the 14th hole during the first round of the Open Championship golf tournament at Royal Troon. Mandatory Credit: Jack Gruber-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFive years removed from winning the Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, Irishman Shane Lowry rode a hot putter to a bogey-free 66, his lowest opening-round score in 46 career major appearances and one better than his start en route to victory in 2019.\n\n\"Lucky I watched a lot of golf this morning and I saw that the golf course was not playing easy,\" he said.\"Just tried to go out and play my game and hit some good shots and hole a few putts, and I did that, and I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nLowry was hot with the putter, especially from the 10-foot range, sinking three birdies on the front nine, including at the Postage Stamp, and a 21-footer at No. 11.\n\n\"I feel like links greens when you start to see your lines, the hole feels quite big, so it felt like that today, and long may it continue,\" he said.\n\nLowry may have been better prepared for the change in wind direction after playing some rounds at Troon two weeks during a scouting trip.\n\n\"I played this wind on the second day that I played here,\" he said. \"I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it.\"\n\nLowry held the opening-round lead when he won in 2019, and said getting off to a fast start should serve him well, but there's a long way to go.\n\n\"Look, I'd give anything to win this tournament again,\" he said. \"I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week.

But with rounds of 66 and 68 at the Burnham & Berrow qualifying site, Rose finished in a tie for first and earned his spot in the field to secure his 22nd appearance in the game's oldest major.\n\nThe Englishman started well in chasing that elusive Claret Jug, signing for a bogey-free 2-under 69 on Thursday.\n\nRose noted that he switched last week to a Scotty Cameron putter for the slower greens on this side of the pond and the early returns have been good.\n\n\"Just for a change of feel,\" Rose said. \"Just changed it up for a different visual for a period of time and see if we can find some magic.\"\n\nAdam Scott's shaft switch\n\nAdam Scott after putting on the 18th green during the first round of the Open Championship golf tournament at Royal Troon.

He swapped out the shafts in his irons to the True Temper Project X LZ, a shaft he used back in 2016.\n\n\"I don't know why I changed from it,\" he said. \"I played good that year, so of course I changed it.\"\n\nScott said he made the change leading into the Scottish Open after a nice pattern started emerging in his swing after making the adjustment.\n\n\"It's incredible. It's one of those things I've been looking for, like it just started feeling easy again whereas I feel like it's been hard work and I don't know why,\" Scott said. \"I couldn't quite figure it out.\"\n\nThe Postage Stamp stumps McIlroy and others\n\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland looks on from the 18th green on day one of The 152nd Open championship at Royal Troon on July 18, 2024 in Troon, Scotland.

To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here, it's why we're here.\n\n\"I'll sit back and watch a bit of golf in the afternoon and see where it leaves me come the end of the day, and get out there tomorrow. The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.''\n\nLowry's issue on the 11th ironically occurred after he'd hit the most difficult shot on the hole -- the tee shot -- with the railway just a few yards to the right of the hole. His tee shot came to rest in the right rough and his second shot went way left into the bush.\n\n\"I did the hard part; I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole,'' Lowry said. \"I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\n\n\"Then from there, I hit a great provisional. The referee asked me going down, 'Did I want to find my first one?' And I said, 'No.' So, I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there, and somebody had found it.\n\n\"So, apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it. I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It was not like it wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.''\n\nLowry called the 12th hole \"a key'' to his round because it \"was playing very difficult, straight into the wind.''\n\n\"I hit driver, 4-iron there, too, the best shots I've hit all week, to about 30 feet and made par there,\" he said. \"From then on, I felt like (wind) down out of the left coming in, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.''\n\nLowry lauded how calm he was in the windy conditions.\n\n\"I get to conditions like this, and I know I can do it, I know I can deal with that,'' he said. \"There's an art (to it). It's quite difficult to stand up there from 190 yards and make yourself hit a 4-iron as low as you can. It's quite difficult to tell yourself that.''\n\nLowry credited the time he spent around home in Ireland in the lead-up to this week playing links golf with his buddies as a help.\n\n\"The golf I've played in Ireland, coming here and doing my (preparation) here a few weeks ago, I feel like that's all helped,'' he said. \"I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with how things have gone.''\n\nTo his credit, Brown, who had the 36-hole lead at 6-under, hung in there and dropped only one shot on Friday, standing on 5-under par.\n\nThis is a 29-year-old journeyman who entered the week having missed seven of his previous eight cuts on the DP World Tour and making it into the field after draining a 20-foot putt on the final hole of 36-hole qualifying.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-1nngoc9b4-1721407361622.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721393534&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry told reporters on his return to the clubhouse.\n\n\"As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, (it was) my own fault.\"\n\nThe drama continued when Lowry struck a \"great\" provisional shot - taken when a ball is presumed lost outside a penalty area or out of bounds - to within 12 feet of the hole, only for one eagle-eyed fan to subsequently find his original ball and void his provisional effort in the process.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion with a rules official regarding where to take a drop from, the 37-year-old golfer eventually left with a double bogey - enough to erase his two-shot cushion, but \"not a disaster\", he later reflected.\n\nIf Lowry had lost his cool, he quickly found it in abundance. After rebounding with four steady pars, the Irishman signed off with his second birdie in three holes to restore the gap to English duo Justin Rose and Daniel Brown heading into the weekend.\n\nAs he seeks to turn back the clock to his dominant triumph at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland five years ago, Lowry has no intention of throttling the passion that helped him clinch his sole major to date.\n\n\"I can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot headed at times, but I really feel like that's why I've had the career I've had,\" Lowry, who has nine combined wins on the PGA Tour and European Tour, said.\n\n\"If I go out there and try to be somebody I'm not, you're just not going to be successful ... [But] If I go out there and be myself, I feel like I can do very well. So allowing myself to do that, without getting in your own way.\"\n\nMcIlroy among big stars to crash out\n\nIt was an entirely contrasting day for Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, as the world No. 2 capitulated to become the highest profile casualty of a host of big names that failed to make the cut.\n\nThe 35-year-old star had been out to exorcise the demons of his latest heartbreaking major near-miss at the US Open last month but found only more woe at Royal Troon, finishing 11-over par overall to fall well short of the top-70 players and ties that progressed to the weekend.\n\nNeeding a fast start after a grueling first round 78, McIlroy's hopes of making the cut were effectively extinguished by the end of the sixth hole after a nightmarish stretch. Having bogeyed the third, McIlroy triple bogeyed the following par-five hole before back-to-back bogeys.\n\nA solid back nine saw him go two-under par down the stretch but the damage was done, his closing 75 ensuring his wait for a fifth major will continue into an 11th year.\n\nOnce I made the eight on the 4th hole, that was it. 22 holes into the event and I'm thinking about where I'm going to go on vacation next week,\" McIlroy admitted to reporters.\n\n\"It was a pretty meaningless 14 holes after that, but at least I played okay and at least feel like, when the wind dropped, my game felt a little more comfortable and I hit some good shots.\"\n\nTiger Woods will also be absent from the weekend, resigning him to a third consecutive missed major cut for just the second time in his career.\n\nThe 48-year-old shot 79 and 77 to finish on 14-over par, the joint-highest 36-hole score he has ever recorded at a major, but insisted he still enjoyed the challenge.\n\n\"I've always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors,\" Woods, who added he will \"definitely\" compete at next year's Open at Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland, told reporters Friday.\n\n\"Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn't as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high.\"\n\nOther big names that failed to survive the cut included last month's US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau, and last year's US Open champion Wyndham Clark.\n\nWith McIlroy, world No. 4 Ludvig Aberg and world No. 7 Viktor Hovland also missing out, only half of the world's top-10 ranked players - Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Collin Morikawa, Patrick Cantlay and Jon Rahm - will tee up Saturday.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Justin Thomas is alone in third after a 3-under 68.\n\nA one-time winner on the DP World Tour, the 29-year-old Brown had a round to remember in his major championship debut.\n\nAfter playing the front nine in 2 under, Brown briefly tied Lowry's lead at 4 under with a pair of improbable birdie putts -- from nearly 35 feet at No. 10 and about 42 feet at No. 11.\n\nLowry went on to stick his second shot at the par-4 18th to 5 feet of the pin, prompting a roar from the crowd, and set up a go-ahead birdie to retake sole possession of the lead.\n\n\"It's only one day. We've got three more days,\" Lowry said. \"I kept telling myself that out there because for some reason I felt like the crowd were getting very excited out there.\"\n\nBut Brown stayed steady on the back nine as visibility began to fade. He recovered from a wayward second shot at the par-5 16th and sank a 13-footer for birdie to tie Lowry again. Then he drained an 8-foot putt at about 9:30 p.m. local time to take the top spot for himself.\n\nAfter missing the fairway and green and the par-4 10th, Lowry made a crucial save by sinking a 24-foot putt for par. He took that momentum to the 11th, where his 20 1/2-foot birdie putt fell to give the tournament its first new outright leader in several hours.\n\n\"I went out there, lucky I watched a lot of golf this morning and I saw that the golf course was not playing easy,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, just tried to go out and play my game and hit some good shots and hole a few putts, and I did that, and I'm pretty happy.\"\n\nThomas, a two-time major champion who's struggled in recent seasons, set the early pace by making seven birdies to offset two bogeys and a double. A chip-in birdie at the second hole sent him on his way, and he was 4 under through 11 holes before losing his tee shot at the par-4 12th.\n\nSettling for double bogey there and bogey at No. 13 didn't take him out of the running amid the cool, rainy conditions on the Scottish seaside. Thomas birdied his final two holes, getting a 25-foot birdie putt at No. 18 to fall to take the lead outright.\n\n\"I feel like everything has been turning the right way, and I've been working on the right things,\" said Thomas, who's winless since the 2022 PGA Championship. \"Just like I said, I haven't really had much to show for it. That's just how this game works sometimes. But I know that I'm close the way it is, and I'm just going to keep playing and not play for results, just play for my game, and it'll take care of itself.\"\n\nReigning PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele contended for the lead with three birdies in his first 11 holes before settling for a 2-under 69. He is tied with six others, including Justin Rose -- the 43-year-old Englishman who had to go through final qualifying to make the field.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler finished birdie-bogey-birdie to post a 1-under 70. Past major winners Brooks Koepka, Matt Fitzpatrick of England and Adam Scott of Australia also shot 70.\n\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland is in danger of missing Friday's cut after a disastrous 7-over 78. At the par-3 eighth hole, nicknamed \"Postage Stamp\" for its small green, McIlroy found \"The Coffin\" bunker off the tee. On his first attempt to punch out, the ball trickled back down the slope into the sand.\n\nAfter taking double bogey there and bogey at No. 10, McIlroy drove out of bounds at the par-4 11th and incurred another double bogey.\n\n\"The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week,\" McIlroy said. \"I guess when that happens, you play your practice rounds, you have a strategy that you think is going to help you get around the golf course, but then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Yeah, just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nTiger Woods similarly struggled to an 8-over 79. He only hit 10 of 18 greens in regulation and had two double bogeys to go with two birdies and six bogeys.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors":

Open", "body": "Lowry backs up strong start with two-under par round on Friday.\n\nSHANE LOWRY SET the early clubhouse lead at The Open Championship at seven-under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday.\n\nThe Clara native had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six-under 65.\n\nHowever, Lowry, who won his sole major at The Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two-under par round of 69.\n\nHe leads by two shots from Brown, who showed little sign of nerves under the spotlight in his first major, with a steady first 15 holes to sit at five-under.\n\nSee the latest live leaderboard here >\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes, including this magnificent closing 20-foot putt at the last.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two-under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nThe American was not blown off track as the winds strengthened through Friday afternoon with 11 pars in his opening 13 holes before a monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took him within striking range.\n\nHowever, a costly bogey on the last left him still four adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also in the mix after a one over par round was enough to keep him in the top 10 at one under.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nMeanwhile, a tame Tiger Woods limped to 14 over to miss the cut, as his tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score a tie for 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to Rory McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four-over.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.", "source": {"uri": "the42.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The42"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@the42.ie", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

Brown shot a 1-over 72.\n\nLowry had a two-stroke lead over Brown when he stepped to the 11th hole, which is known as \"The Railway\" and is considered the most difficult on the course because of the railroad running down the right side of the fairway and thick gorse protecting the left.\n\nAfter safely hitting his tee shot 301 yards down the right side, Lowry was left with 176 yards to the pin. As Lowry prepared to hit his approach shot, he noticed a photographer standing several yards in front of him.\n\n\"There was a cameraman there and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry said.\n\nThe photographer raised his camera, and the movement distracted Lowry, he said, causing him to smother his shot out of the high fescue. His ball shot across the fairway and landed in gorse on the left.\n\nLowry turned his frustration to the photographer, telling him, \"Just get outta the way. Just get back there. F---'s sake.\"\n\n\"I did the hard part,\" Lowry said. \"I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole. I had a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\nLowry informed the R&A rules official walking with his group that he was hitting a provisional shot in case his ball was lost. He hit a new ball onto the green, about 15 feet past the hole.\n\nThat's when the real drama ensued. As Lowry was walking up the fairway, he was informed that a spectator had found his original ball in the gorse. Since his ball wasn't actually lost, he had to take an unplayable lie and identify an acceptable spot to hit from.\n\n\"I hit a great provisional,\" Lowry said. \"The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then or you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, you didn't have to go and identify it.\"\n\nLowry asked for a second official to confirm the ruling. After a 20-minute delay, he took a one-stroke penalty for an unplayable lie and dropped his original ball on trampled rough, two club lengths from the previous spot in the gorse bush. His view of the 11th green was obstructed, and his fourth shot landed short of the green. Lowry two-putted from 33 feet.\n\nThe double-bogey 6 dropped Lowry into a first-place tie with Brown at 5 under.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing,\" Lowry said. \"I felt like [caddie] Darren [Reynolds] did a great job too. He kept telling me, 'We have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.'\"\n\nLowry carded pars on each of the next four holes. He reached the par-5 16th green in two shots and two-putted from 58 feet for a birdie. A 20\u00bd-foot birdie on the par-4 18th extended his lead over Brown to two shots.\n\n\"I felt like I went out there, I was in control of my ball [and] did all the right things for a lot of the round,\" Lowry said. \"Then when I got in a bit of trouble, I feel like I really finished the round well. I'm pretty happy with the day. To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here, it's why we're here.\"\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler was five shots behind Lowry after posting a 1-under 70 for the second straight round. Scheffler's caddie, Ted Scott, labored through the round after battling a stomach illness Thursday night. He was seen lying on the ground and sitting between holes Friday.\n\n\"He seemed to feel better as the day went on,\" Scheffler said. \"The doc here took good care of him, but he did not sleep very much last night apparently.

He could not hit it right, where out-of-bounds and the Scottish Rail run along the entirety of this hole's right side, hence the nickname.\n\nSo, Lowry understandably went left. But he went too far left into danger, another reason why this hole is so tough. You cannot miss on either side. At any rate, a big number loomed as Lowry, who had played near flawless golf to that point, held the lead at 7-under par.\n\nBut knowing gorse almost always leads to lost balls, Lowry took another drop and hit his fourth shot to about eight feet away. He had a chance to dash out of there with a bogey-five, which would have been remarkable considering the circumstances. Even Ryder Cup legend Sam Torrance, who called some action for USA Network early Friday, called the shot \"magnificent.\"\n\nThen, unfortunately for Lowry, a spectator had located the Irishman's ball at the stem of the gorse, a spot nobody could play from. When you find your ball, you have to play it. But Lowry wished nobody saw it.\n\nRules officials, spectators, and Lowry then deliberated for 20 minutes as the 2019 Open winner pondered where to drop. It took a while, but Lowry knew he had all the time in the world. He was not in a rush because he knew another mistake could seriously jeopardize his chances of winning a second Claret Jug.\n\n\"I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing,\" Lowry explained.\n\n\"I felt like [my caddie] Darren [Reynolds] did a great job telling me, 'We have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.'\"\n\nLowry finally took his drop and pitched up to the front of the green. He two-putted from there and walked away with a double-bogey.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6,\" Lowry added. \"It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nBut Lowry would not have been in this predicament if he had not lost his train of thought for a split second.\n\n\"There was a cameraman there, and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry said of the moment that took place right before he rifled his second shot into the gorse.\n\n\"As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should have stood off it; my own fault.\"\n\nHe somehow re-focused and took his time to regain his composure. But the critical moment for him, he says, came on the par-4 12th, a hole that plays dead into the wind. He needed to bounce back and not compound his mistake, a tall task considering the 12th played as the most difficult hole on Friday -- an eye-opening reality knowing how challenging the 11th is.\n\n\"I hit driver, 4-iron there too, the best shots I've hit all week, to about 30 feet and made par there,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"From then on, I felt [the wind] down out of the left coming in. It was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nLowry took advantage of the par-5 16th -- the only real birdie opportunity the back nine offers. He found the green in two and two-putted from 58 feet.\n\nHe then closed with a gorgeous birdie on the par-4 18th, rolling in a 20-footer to get back to 7-under, where he was when he stood on the 11th tee.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with the day,\" Lowry said.\n\n\"To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here, it's why we're here. Yeah, I'll sit back and watch a bit of golf in the afternoon, see where it leaves me at the end of the day, and get out there tomorrow. The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.\"\n\nWhen Lowry won this tournament in 2019, he finished six strokes ahead of runner-up Tommy Fleetwood. After the second round, he held a share of the 36-hole lead with J.B. Holmes, and then, on Saturday, he fired a course record, 8-under 63, to take a four-shot lead going into the final round.\n\n\"I wouldn't say I'm a good runner,\" Lowry joked when a reporter asked if he is a good frontrunner.\n\n\"I don't know. I put myself there in a few big tournaments, and I've managed to knock them off. So I've done it a few times. I don't know. It's hard to win tournaments. We'll see. I'll tell you Sunday evening.\"\n\nLowry holds a two-shot after 36-holes over Daniel Brown at the midway point of the championship. Time will tell if he can claim his second Claret Jug, but if he can remain level-headed -- just as he did for those 20 minutes on the 11th hole -- he will be hard to beat.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_milko@sbnation.com", "name": "Jack Milko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Torrance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Torrance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y67tCstVhKJeoovs4qJkDN_4WTQ=/0x325:3566x2108/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25537755/2162664200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

"Lowry takes British Open lead as torrid Tiger misses cut", "body": "World number one Scottie Scheffler closed to within four shots of the lead at the British Open\n\nShane Lowry moved into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par after his second round at Royal Troon on Friday as a tame Tiger Woods limped to 14 over to miss the cut.\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, recovered from a dramatic double bogey on the 11th that threatened to derail his charge to post a two under par round of 69.\n\nHe leads by two shots from Brown, who showed little sign of nerves under the spotlight in his first major, with a steady first 14 holes to sit at five under.\n\nLowry was on the charge as he hit the turn in 34 thanks to birdies on the first, fifth and eighth.\n\nThe world number 33, though, was rocked as after a wayward tee shot at the 11th, he veered way left into thick bushes.\n\nRemarkably Lowry's ball was found, but deemed unplayable forcing him to play a drop and lose two shots.\n\nHe bounced back impressively picking up two shots in the final three holes.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler has Lowry in his sights as the American moved into a share of fourth at two under despite dropping a shot at 18.\n\nScheffler has already won six times this year, including his second Masters title in April.\n\nThe American was not blown off track as the winds strengthened through Friday afternoon with 11 pars in his opening 13 holes before a monster putt at the 14th and a birdie on the par-five 16th took him within striking range.\n\nHowever, a costly bogey on the last left him still four adrift of Lowry.\n\nUSPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is also in the mix after a one over par round was enough to keep him in the top 10 at one under.\n\n- Woods' worst ever Open -\n\nWoods' tournament came to a sorry end after two rounds that will do little to quell doubts over whether he should continue to put a battered body through the strain of looking to add to his 15 major titles.\n\nThe 48-year-old hit back at suggestions earlier in the week from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire to preserve his status as one of the sport's all-time legends.\n\nWoods has stressed he feels physically better of late as he continues to fight back from the severe leg injuries he suffered in a car crash in 2021.\n\nBut the three-time British Open champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links with his two-round score a tie for 149th out of the 154 players still active in the tournament.\n\nHis score of 156 over two rounds matches his worst ever at a major with the 2015 US Open and is his poorest at a British Open by three shots.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78 with the projected cut sitting at four over.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nkca/jc\n\nMore from this section\n\nWilliam Cole Vineyards Celebrates the 25th Anniversary of Cuv\u00e9e Claire\n\nLuvme Hair Celebrates Success with Atlanta Pop-Up Shop\n\nNational Nonprofit

Despite a double bogey on the 11th, Lowry managed a two under par round of 69, giving him a two-shot lead over Englishman Daniel Brown, who sits at five under. World number one Scottie Scheffler is in a share of fourth place at two under, four shots behind Lowry.\n\nTiger Woods' tournament ended in disappointment as he missed the cut, finishing at 14 over par. Woods, a three-time British Open champion, struggled in the blustery conditions, matching his worst-ever major score of 156 over two rounds. This poor performance raises further doubts about his ability to compete at the highest level following severe leg injuries from a 2021 car crash.\n\nAttention now turns to Rory McIlroy, who needs an under-par round to make the weekend after a seven over par first round. US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also faces a challenge, starting his second round at five over.

And when it was over, Shane Lowry saw his two-shot lead evaporate, and he had a fight on his hands at the top of the Open Championship leaderboard.\n\nCredit Lowry, then, for pivoting off that frustration and continuing to press forward at Royal Troon. He closed his round with two birdies in the final three holes to bring home a clubhouse lead of -7, two strokes clear of the field.\n\nThe debate, which unfolded after Lowry appeared to lose his ball off the tee at 11, included everything from a rant at photographers to a lost-then-found ball to a missed approach. The result: a double-bogey that cost him the entirety of his lead over Daniel Brown. But with seven holes remaining, Lowry bore down and recaptured the lead.\n\n\"I was happy enough leaving (the par-4 11th) with a 6,\" Lowry said. \"It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nLowry, the 2019 Open champion, is in his element at Royal Troon, mastering both the wind and the greens. He understands that this course plays into his hands: \"I get to conditions like this, and I know I can do it, I know I can deal with that,\" he said. \"I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone. Yeah, I'm pretty happy with how things have gone.\"\n\nHe'll almost certainly be in the last group heading out on Saturday. Asked if he was a good frontrunner, Lowry paused and replied, \"I wouldn't say I'm a good runner.\"\n\nFive shots back lurks Masters champion and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who posted his second straight 1-under day to finish at -2. Scheffler struggled a touch with his putter, but conceded he has work to do to catch up to Lowry. \"I've played two solid rounds and it put me five shots back,\" Scheffler said, \"and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts out there.\"\n\n\"I'm not sure Scottie Scheffler is too worried about anyone with the form he's in,\" Lowry said. \"He's obviously on the leaderboard, and he's one person that people are going to be talking about.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yP1tTavNQXfl4kLTcRIyhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/ad12aef0-45d8-11ef-bffe-0abda1ee01c3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\n\"I played really solid, got it around. I felt like I had great control of the ball,\" said Thomas.\n\nWorld number three Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nFive-time major champion Brooks Koepka defied the worst of the weather to post four consecutive bridies between the fourth and the seventh before dropping back to one under.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three 3-putts today. I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today.\"\n\nCameron Smith, champion at St. Andrews two years ago, fared even worse with an 80.\n\nWorld number four Ludvig Aberg was another of the big names to falter in his first ever round at a British Open with a four-over round of 75.\n\nThe Swede's playing partner Jon Rahm is two over, while home favourite Bob McIntyre is in the running after a one-over 72 to back up his victory at last week's Scottish Open.\n\nkca/pi/ea", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"And Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too. He kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on.

He recovered with two birdies over the final three holes for a 2-under 69, giving him a two-shot lead as the second round headed for a conclusion.\n\nAnd now he gets to wait even longer before he plays again, a product of being in the lead and among the late starters on the weekend with the silver claret jug he won five years ago at Royal Portrush coming more into view.\n\nHe was at 7-under 135, two shots ahead of surprise 18-hole leader Daniel Brown of England (72) and Justin Rose (68). Lowry shared the 36-hole lead when he won at Portrush in 2019.\n\n\"Look, I'm going to have a very late tee time tomorrow. I'm not going to be playing for another 24 hours. I know what that's about,\" Lowry said. \"I know tomorrow is going to be a long day, but I've done it before.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Try not to worry about what other people are doing and just trying to take care of your own personal stuff.\"\n\nIt was best to keep blinders on at Royal Troon. There were some harrowing scenes.\n\nJustin Thomas, who opened with a 68 to get himself in the mix, shot a 45 on the front nine and played his best golf from there to salvage a 78 and make sure he at least made the cut.\n\nRobert MacIntyre had an even tougher start. Scotland's biggest star after winning his national Open last week, MacIntyre was stuck in pot bunkers and high grass. He was 8 over for his round through four holes -- four holes! -- and then put together a big fight on the back nine in a bid to make the weekend.\n\nAguri Iwasaki had them all beat. He took a 9 on consecutive holes and shot 52 on the back nine for a 91. One of those 9s was on the par-3 14th, where he took four shots out of two bunkers and once had to go backward toward the fairway.\n\nTiger Woods missed another cut in a major -- that was one of the few surprises because he opened with a 79 -- but left his mark by tying his own mark with his highest 36-hole score as a pro with 156. The only time he had a higher 36-hole score was at Bay Hill in 1994 when he was a senior in high school.\n\nWoods had company in leaving early. Rory McIlroy, who started with a 78, needed a good start and got a triple bogey on the par-5 fourth hole. He barely moved it from high grass, chipped from more rough into a bunker and missed a 4-foot putt.\n\nMasters champion Scottie Scheffler missed all that calamity. He put together another steady round of 70 -- three birdies, two bogeys and the rest pars -- and joined the group at 2-under 140. He was five shots behind Lowry as he chases his second major of the year.\n\nJoaquin Niemann of Chile managed another 71 despite taking a quintuple-bogey 8 on the par-3 eighth hole -- the Postage Stamp -- that measures a mere 123 yards. He was in three bunkers around the tiny green and three-putted when he finally got out of them. Niemann also made six birdies in a most remarkable round of level par.\n\nSo much chaos across the century-old links, and it looked for a brief moment like Lowry might take part. It took so long to play the 11th hole that Jordan Spieth in the group behind him walked over to the side of the fairway and sat down near a gorse bush to wait.\n\nLowry at least kept it in play, though it was in the rough to the right. He was distracted by a photographer and angry at himself for not backing off the shot that he tugged left toward a clump of gorse.\n\nFiguring it would be lost in the prickly mess, Lowry hit a provisional for a lost ball onto the green, a terrific shot. One problem. Someone found the ball. It was no longer lost, so the provisional ball was not in play.\n\nLowry took a penalty drop from the bush, going back to find a place where he had a swing, put it short of the green, chipped on and salvaged a double bogey 6.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament,\" Lowry said.\n\nHe made five birdies on the day, and yet nothing felt better than a par. That came on the 12th, one of the toughest holes into the wind. He hit driver and 4-iron to 30 feet, two putts for a most beautiful, calming par.\n\n\"The best shots I've hit all week,\" Lowry said. \"From then on, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAnd now comes a big opportunity for Lowry to reclaim that claret jug, for Rose to become the first player in the modern era of exemptions to come through 36-hole qualifying, and for Brown to become one of the biggest surprises since Ben Curtis in 2003 at Royal St. George's.\n\nAnd so many others are very much in the mix, starting with Scheffler, golf's best player.\n\n\"I've played two solid rounds and it put me five shots back, and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts,\" Scheffler said, making it all sound so simple on a day when nothing felt easy.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

At7-under 135, he has a two-shot edge over Englishmen Daniel Brown and Justin Rose entering the weekend in Troon, South Ayrshire, Scotland.\n\n\"I know (Saturday) is going to be a long day, but I've done it before,\" the 2019 Open champion said after his morning round. \"Going out there leading the tournament, who knows if I'm going to be leading by the end of the day? With these conditions, probably will be, but we'll have to wait and see.\"\n\nStiff winds exceeding 30 mph around the seaside course kept scores down in the afternoon. No one shot better than a 3-under 68 Friday, and Rose's was the only 68 from the afternoon wave.\n\nAfter carding three birdies and one bogey on the front nine, Lowry's second shot at the par-4 11th got lost in the rough, and he hit a provisional ball onto the green. Then his original ball was found; by rule he was required to play it. It took 20 minutes between shots for Lowry to make the decision to take a penalty stroke and a drop.\n\nHe hit a blind shot over shrubbery onto the green and double bogeyed back to 5 under.\n\n\"The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was OK,\" Lowry said. \"Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\n\"... To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It was not like -- it wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nBrown, the surprise 18-hole leader in his major championship debut, followed his first-round 65 with a 1-over 72. The No. 272-ranked golfer said he watched from home when Lowry won the 2019 Open and appreciates Lowry's grit and determination.\n\n\"Hopefully I'll get to witness that firsthand (Saturday) and try and hopefully go toe to toe with him,\" Brown said.\n\nRose, 43, didn't make his first bogey of the tournament until the 12th hole Friday. He capitalized at Nos. 16 and 18 with birdie putts, the latter a 41-foot bomb that ignited the home crowd.\n\nLike Brown, Rose had to earn his spot in the Open field as a qualifier. The one-time major champ, who placed fourth at the 1998 Open as an amateur, wants to win this major more than any other.\n\n\"You've got to be in it to win it, and the first big part of the journey was getting in the tournament,\" Rose said.\n\n\"... I look back (at qualifying), we played in a really, really tough westerly breeze. That golf course is incredibly difficult in a westerly and I think even that little bit of experience of (getting) back playing some tough links golf has probably helped me a little bit these last two days.\"\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler carded a 70 to join a tie at 2 under with Billy Horschel (68) and South Africa's Dean Burmester (69). Scheffler holed a 35-foot birdie putt at the par-3 14th and added a birdie at No. 16 to get to 3 under, but he found a pot bunker off the 18th tee and finished up with a bogey.\n\nThe two-time Masters winner -- whose caddie, Ted Scott, dealt with a stomach illness throughout the day -- is in contention to win his first major outside Augusta National.\n\n\"So far it's been two really successful days, keeping my head in it nice and taking the good breaks and the bad breaks in stride and just continuing to grind. So that's what's most important to me,\" Scheffler said.\n\nTied at 1 under are Xander Schauffele (72), Patrick Cantlay (68), Australia's Jason Day (68) and Canada's Corey Conners (70). Chile's Joaquin Niemann and England's Matthew Jordan both shot 71 and are tied at even par. The group at 1 over includes major champions Dustin Johnson (69), Collin Morikawa (70), Jon Rahm of Spain (70) and Brooks Koepka (73).\n\nJustin Thomas began the day in third place at 3 under but shot a disastrous 9-over 45 on his front nine, capped by a triple bogey at No. 9, to plummet out of contention. He righted the ship on the back nine, finishing with a 78 to make the cut by two shots.\n\nTiger Woods followed an opening 79 with a 6-over 77 Friday to finish the two rounds at 14 over, missing the cut at his third straight major.\n\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland joined Woods in the double digits at 11 over par after a 75. On the way to a triple-bogey 8 at No. 4, McIlroy hit his second shot only two yards in a native area. His fifth shot crossed the green into a bunker, and he missed a double-bogey putt from 4 feet.\n\nOther notable players on the wrong side of the 6-over cut line included U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau (9 over), Englishman Tommy Fleetwood (9 over), Norway's Viktor Hovland (10 over) and 2022 Open champ Cameron Smith of Australia (12 over).", "source": {"uri": "kenyastar.com", "dataType":

The 29-year-old from Northallerton shot a flawless 65 to take a one-shot lead in the Open.\n\nIn his first major championship, let alone his first Open, Brown led the field in strokes gained from the tee and performed equally strongly from putting. He gained 4.5 strokes on the greens to rank second in strokes gained from putting in the field at Royal Troon. Brown is making his third appearance on the PGA Tour, having come within a cut of the Scottish Open, but had failed to make six consecutive cuts before that. According to The athlete Contributor Justin Ray says Brown is the only player in the past 30 years to start his major career with an error-free round of 65 or less.\n\nBehind Brown is a player who is well aware of the tough conditions that continued at Royal Troon on Thursday. Shane Lowry is second at 5-under par. Lowry, who won the 2019 Open at Royal Portrush in his native Ireland, has become a standout player in recent years. He has only two PGA Tour wins but has won at Portrush and finished 25th or better in 15 of his last 22 majors.\n\nLowry put himself in good positions all day while many of his contemporaries found themselves buried in thick bushes and deep bunkers. Meanwhile, he made no mistakes on the greens, leading the team in putting, successfully putting all 14 inside 10 feet. He scored one on holes 7, 8 and 10 to lead the group and settled into first place with six straight before heading to the 18th hole to take a one-putt.\n\nLowry has had a rough start to 2024, even admitting in his win at the Zurich Classic that teammate Rory McIlroy sometimes carried him. Since that win, Lowry has finished sixth at the PGA Championship, 19th at the U.S. Open and ninth at the Travelers Championship.\n\nJustin Thomas entered the locker room leading the morning group after shooting a 68 in more difficult conditions. Thomas has struggled badly on the golf courses in his career. Thomas' best finish in the Open Championship was 11th in 2019 and his best finish since then was 40th. He has missed three of his seven Open rounds and last year he opened with an 82 at Royal Liverpool which was his lowest finish.\n\nBut on Thursday, Thomas attacked the greens with flying colors and finished well. He finished 10th in the group in strokes gained while making 16 of his 18 putts from 20 feet to take advantage.\n\nBut Thomas responded even more impressively when the field got the better of him. After starting at four under par on the 10th hole with a two-shot lead, he double-faulted on the 12th and then followed that up with another on the 13th. Royal Troon had been eating players up all day by that point, but Thomas finished the round with two shots on the 17th and 18th.\n\n\"I feel like everything is going in the right direction, that I'm working on the right things,\" Thomas said. \"As I said, I haven't had a lot of success. That's how it goes in this game sometimes. But I know I'm close to success, and I'm going to keep playing and I'm not going to play for the results, I'm just going to play for my performance, and I'm going to make it myself.\"\n\nWith the exception of Thomas, the European players performed well in the most international major tournament. In addition to the great starts from Lowry and Brown, England's Justin Rose shot a flawless 69, and 23-year-old Dane Nicolai Hojgaard and Swede Alex Noren also finished on two under par.\n\nThey were joined by 69-year-old Xander Schoeffel - who won the PGA Championship in May - and Russell Henley, who was looking for his first major victory.\n\nBut it seemed that several of the big stars on the field had been dismissed early in the day. The top two players at last month's U.S. Open, McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau, were 7- and 5-shots behind, respectively. McIlroy had only one shot all day, while DeChambeau was 6-shot behind through eight holes and needed an eagle on the 16th to set his lowest score.\n\n\"It's a completely different test,\" DeChambeau said. \"I haven't trained for it, I haven't played much in the rain. Yes, it's a tough test here. Something I don't know very well.\"\n\nTiger Woods, who played all four majors in a single year for the first time since 2019, started the day one under par but quickly lost eight strokes over the next nine holes to finish 8 over par. That puts him 140th in the field. Woods, 48, has not finished better than 47th in the seven majors he has played since a 2021 car accident that left him with serious leg injuries.", "source": {"uri": "houstonianonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "houstonianonline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Travelers Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Liverpool_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Liverpool Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't.\n\n\"[But] I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And I felt like Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too, he kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times.

Brown shot a 1-over 72.\n\nLowry had a two-stroke lead over Brown when he stepped to the 11th hole, which is known as \"The Railway\" and is considered the most difficult on the course because of the railroad running down the right side of the fairway and thick gorse protecting the left.\n\nAfter safely hitting his tee shot 301 yards down the right side, Lowry was left with 176 yards to the pin. As Lowry prepared to hit his approach shot, he noticed a photographer standing several yards in front of him.\n\n\"There was a cameraman there and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry said.\n\nThe photographer raised his camera, and the movement distracted Lowry, causing him to smother his shot out of the high fescue. His ball shot across the fairway and landed in gorse on the left.\n\nLowry turned his frustration to the photographer, telling him, \"Just get outta the way. Just get back there. F---'s sake.\"\n\n\"I did the hard part,\" Lowry said. \"I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole. I had a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\nLowry informed the R&A rules official walking with his group that he was hitting a provisional shot in case his ball was lost. He hit a new ball onto the green, about 15 feet past the hole.\n\nThat's when the real drama ensued. As Lowry was walking up the fairway, he was informed that a spectator had found his original ball in the gorse. Since his ball wasn't actually lost, he had to take an unplayable lie and identify an acceptable spot to hit from.\n\n\"I hit a great provisional,\" Lowry said. \"The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then or you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, you didn't have to go and identify it.\"\n\nLowry asked for a second official to confirm the ruling. After a 20-minute delay, he took a one-stroke penalty for an unplayable lie and dropped his original ball on an elevated spot in the adjoining 12th fairway. His view of the 11th green was obstructed, and his fourth shot landed short of the green. He two-putted from 33 feet.\n\nThe double-bogey 6 dropped Lowry into a first-place tie with Brown at 5 under.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing,\" Lowry said. \"I felt like [caddie] Darren [Reynolds] did a great job too. He kept telling me, 'We have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.'\"\n\nLowry carded pars on each of the next four holes. He reached the par-5 16th green in two shots and two-putted from 58 feet for a birdie. A 20\u00bd-foot birdie on the par-4 18th extended his lead over Brown to two shots.\n\n\"I felt like I went out there, I was in control of my ball [and] did all the right things for a lot of the round,\" Lowry said. \"Then when I got in a bit of trouble, I feel like I really finished the round well. I'm pretty happy with the day. To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here, it's why we're here.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schlabach@espn.com", "name": "Mark Schlabach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-stroke engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0719%2Fr1360573_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The Irishman was out in the early wave on Friday and put the pedal to the floor, claiming the solo lead at seven-under by the time he arrived at the par-four 11th - the infamous railway hole which claimed Rory McIlroy as one of its victims in the opening round.\n\nLowry was able to keep his tee shot in play but caught a poor lie in the fescue. And when he attempted to play his second shot, the long grass grabbed the hosel of the club and sent the ball straight left, flying over the gallery and into a gorse bush.\n\nREAD MORE: Dustin Johnson left to regret four-hole stretch as Open hopes in the balance\n\nREAD MORE: Shane Lowry reaction to rowdy Open crowd sums him up after racing into early contention\n\nThe 37-year-old was fuming with the outcome and he had a few choice words for a cameraman. Lowry unloaded: \"As I was over the ball I could just see you putting your ------- camera up. Just get out of the way. Just get back there. ---- sake.\"\n\nWith Lowry presuming his ball was lost, he dropped and quickly struck an accurate approach to the green with what he believed was his fourth shot. However, as he started walking down the fairway, he was informed that a member of the crowd had found Lowry's ball deep in the bush.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nAs a result, the shot he played onto the green was null and void. Instead, he had to declare his ball unplayable and take a drop, hitting his fourth shot again. But this time, with a more difficult angle, he was unable to find the putting surface, coming up a few feet short.\n\nHis bogey putt dribbled three feet past the cup and he was left to mark down a double-bogey six on the scorecard as he walked to the 12th, dropping back into a share of the lead with Broiwn at five-under.\n\nLowry shot his best opening round at a major championship on Thursday and he told reporters how much it would mean to lift the Claret Jug for a second time.\n\n\"It's great, but there's three rounds left,\" he said of his opening 18 holes. \"If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today.

Carding a bogey-free 66, the 2019 champion clipped the course scoring average at Royal Troon by more than eight strokes and positioned himself one shot behind shocking leader Daniel Brown (-6). Both stand in front of notable names like Justin Thomas, Xander Schauffele, Brooks Koepka and Scottie Scheffler.\n\nLowry's 66 represents the lowest opening round in his major career and his first 18-hole lead at such a tournament. It matches his previous best position at this juncture of The Open: He trailed J.B. Holmes by a single stroke at Royal Portrush in 2019. That led to the lone victory of Lowry's major career as he raised the Claret Jug that Sunday.\n\n\"I played pretty good. I'm pretty happy. But it's only one day. We've got three more days,\" Lowry said. \"I kept telling myself that out there because, for some reason, I felt like the crowd were getting very excited out there. It was late in the afternoon. A few points, the attendance were high out there, I'd say. They were quite excitable out there, and it felt more like the weekend.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nTeeing off in the afternoon hours, the Irishman received a reprieve from the conditions relative to those who were out on the golf course Thursday morning. With the wind dying down a bit, Lowry coupled solid ball striking with a scorching hot putter to ascend to the top of the leaderboard.\n\nNeeding just 25 putts on the day, he rolled in all 14 of his attempts inside 10 feet, including a 5-foot birdie bid on the last to take a portion of the lead into Friday. Brown trailed Lowry on both the golf course and leaderboard at that juncture, but once the Englishman grabbed a birdie late on No. 16, Lowry had company at the top. Another birdie on the last for Brown shot him all the way to the top of the leaderboard.\n\nThat's where The Open stands with 54 holes to play as Lowry aims to become the first player since Ernie Els in 2012 to claim a second Claret Jug.\n\n\"If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today,\" Lowry said. \"I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days. Look, I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week. This is obviously a great start to do that.\"\n\n1. Daniel Brown (-6): Lowry's presence near the top of the leaderboard was unsurprising. Brown, on the other hand, is the definition of surprising sitting in a solo lead after 18 holes. Before finishing outside the top 60 at the Scottish Open and cashing a paycheck, he had missed six straight cuts on the DP World Tour. Brown looked like a completely different man today carding one of three bogey-free rounds and missing just one fairway.\n\n2. Shane Lowry (-5)\n\n3. Justin Thomas (-3): How does a 14-stroke improvement sound? After starting last year's Open with an 82, Thomas began this year's championship with a 68. A first-round leader at the Scottish Open, he finished outside the top 60 by week's end. So, Thomas will need to prove that he can keep a good thing going over these next 54 holes. Major championships have not been kind to him over the last two years as he entered this week having missed the cut in five of the last seven.\n\nT4. Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele, Alex Noren, Nicolai Hojgaard, Russell Henley (-2): Rose is the seasoned veteran on this leaderboard as the Englishman was flawless Thursday with two birdies against 16 pars. He ranked second in strokes gained tee to green and should have realistic staying power having contended at the PGA Championship already this season. After needing to go through Open qualifying, Rose has positioned himself to win The Open with 54 holes to go.\n\n\"It's obvious, isn't it? [I'm] 44 soon. History would suggest [the clock is ticking],\" Rose said. \"But I think The Open offers you that opportunity maybe more than some of the other majors. Yeah, still feel very kind of confident in myself that I can actually still improve tomorrow versus today. As long as that's the case, I'll keep kind of believing for sure.\"\n\nT11. Scottie Scheffler, Brooks Koepka, Adam Scott, Matt Fitzpatrick, Sepp Straka, Matt Wallace, Chris Kirk (-1): This group is littered with major champions. Scheffler put together a sneaky effort Thursday carding birdies on two of his last three holes to slide into red figures. Meanwhile, Koepka found something with his putter -- which has abandoned him for the most part in 2024 -- and rattled off four straight birdies at one point in his first round. Scott was fantastic from tee to green as well ranking inside the top five in what was his 93rd straight major appearance.\n\nT18. Jordan Spieth, Tony Finau, Joaquin Niemann, Min Woo Lee and nine others (E): Want to talk about firepower? This crop of players have exactly that. Spieth got up and down from 300 yards on the par-5 16th to find himself in red figures briefly. A dropped shot on No. 17 pushed him back to even just as it did to Finau hours earlier. Both players hit their irons solidly, but it was Niemann who was the most lethal off the tee hitting 12 of 14 fairways.\n\nT31. Robert MacIntyre, Matthieu Pavon, Billy Horschel and eight others (+1): MacIntyre joked he may not have had the best preparation for this championship due to a Monday hangover following his Scottish Open victory. Despite that, the Scotsman hung tough. A closing birdie helped to ease the sting of a couple lip-out birdies during the middle portion of his round. MacIntyre has quietly been a great major competitor over the years and looks to be in a good spot once again.\n\nT42. Jon Rahm, Brian Harman, Tyrrell Hatton, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Cantlay and 23 others (+2): It's been a disappointing major championship season for Rahm, but despite carding a 73, there's still a chance to turn things around. All these players came in below the course average and many of them faced the toughest of the conditions. Rahm struggled off the tee, Harman found trouble coming into the greens, and Hatton said he hit the ball as poorly as he has all year.\n\n\"The greens are firm. The greens are really firm,\" Harman said. \"We got the text this morning that they had gone up probably like 5 percent or so in the firmness, and it was very apparent, especially coming downwind. It's almost impossible to stop the ball.\"\n\nT70. Dustin Johnson, Davis Thompson, Keegan Bradley and 10 others (+3)\n\nT83. Ludvig \u00c5berg, Viktor Hovland, Hideki Matsuyama and 10 others (+4)\n\nT96. Bryson DeChambeau, Tommy Fleetwood, Tom Kim, Max Homa, Sungjae Im, Will Zalatoris and 18 others (+5): DeChambeau got punched in the face immediately as he played his first six holes in 5 over. After turning in 42, the U.S. Open champion did well to claw back on his second nine. An eagle on No. 16 put his name just outside the cutline heading into the second round.\n\nT120. Sahith Theegala, Henrik Stenson, Lucas Glover and seven others (+6)\n\nT129. Rory McIlroy, Wyndham Clark, Louis Oosthuizen and five others (+7): McIlroy's redemption story will have to find a new setting. After playing his first seven holes in even par, the four-time major champion played his next four holes in 5 over. Two bogeys across his last four holes put a bow on one of the worst rounds in McIlroy's Open career.\n\nT138. Tiger Woods, Rickie Fowler and five others (+8): With his round of 79, Woods' scoring average in majors this season is now 75.4. He got off to a great start with an early birdie but sloppiness throughout the bag caused Tiger's name to tumble down the leaderboard as the round progressed. He hasn't played a weekend at The Open since 2018 at Carnoustie, an event he nearly won.\n\n\"I mean, he's only playing major championships,\" Schauffele said of Woods. \"He's making it as hard on himself as possible, and I know he's hard on himself, too. It's just hard. I think he's just learning. He's got to learn a little bit more about his body, what he can and can't do. I'm sure he'd like to prep more at home if his body would allow it. This is all stuff -- I'm not sure he tells you guys this stuff or not. But as a tour pro now, I kind of know what goes into it and what needs to be done to play at a high level. If your body is not letting you do it, it's just frustrating. I'm sure he's trying to figure that out.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_mcdonald@cbssports.com", "name": "Patrick

Although the vast majority of his career wins occurred during his time in the European Tour, Lowry has tended to come to life at major tournaments, including this year's British Open.\n\nThe Irishman placed sixth in this year's PGA Championship, just a few weeks after outlasting Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer in a playoff to take home the Zurich Classic of New Orleans title. An unremarkable showing at the U.S. Open followed. But at Royal Troon, the verdant oasis located on Scotland's south coast that is hosting this year's Open Championships, Lowry has been a cut above. He recorded a glimmering -2 score in Round 2, bringing his score for the tourney to a field-leading -7, two strokes better than his closest competition.\n\nWill Lowry be able to hold on? There's plenty of time left for others to make a comeback, including Daniel Brown (-5) and Justin Rose (-4), who sit in second place and third place, respectively.\n\nLowry has been here before, however. He's five years removed from his first (and to date, only) major title, one that came in circumstances eerily similar to the ones that exist at Royal Troon this time around.\n\nHere's a look back at Lowry's major history including his past performances at the British Open.\n\nMORE: Tiger Woods to miss cut at Open Championship\n\nLowry has one major title to his name, conquering all foes en route to a six-stroke win at the 2019 British Open.\n\nHe hasn't been able to pick up a second major trophy just yet, but his performances in the other three major tournaments seem to indicate better days could be on the way. Lowry finished tied for second in the 2016 U.S. Open, tied for third in the Masters in 2022, and tied for fourth at the PGA Championship in 2021.\n\nAll told, Lowry has eight top-10 finishes in 45 major appearances across the four tournaments.\n\nMORE: Meet Daniel Brown, the Brit competing with Shane Lowry, Justin Rose in his major debut\n\nLowry's first and only major win came at the 2019 British Open, held at Royal Portrush Golf Club in Northern Ireland.\n\nLowry shined beneath the rolling Inishowen hills, breaking the course record (since it was remodeled) with an 8-under 63 to take sole possession of first place in Round 3. Lowry's first three rounds were historic -- he carded a 197 across his first 54 holes, the best hole-scoring performance through 54 in Open Championship history.\n\nA 1-over 72 was all Lowry needed in the final round to hoist the Claret Jug. Lowry's six-stroke margin of victory over Tommy Fleetwood represented the largest winning margin in a major in two years.\n\nMORE: Tracking Rory McIlroy's worst finishes at British Open\n\nHere is a breakdown of Lowry's rounds at the 2019 British Open.\n\nLowry has won the British Open, taking home the Claret Jug following his impressive 2019 showcase. By in large, he's been solid, if unspectacular in the competition. Outside of his showing in 2019, Lowry has only placed in the top 10 in the British Open on one other occasion (2014). In 2023, he suffered the scorn of the cut line, seeing his British Open dreams vanish after the second round with a putrid 7-over 149 through the course's first 36 holes.\n\nAssuming Lowry keeps his hot streak going, he's on pace to secure his best performance at The Open since his win in 2019. With five strokes separating him and fourth place, he's in good stead to nab at least a top-10 finish when the dust settles.\n\nLowry is participating in his 12th British Open in 2024. He's made the cut in six of his prior 11 appearances in the tournament and has two top-10 and four top-25 displays to his name.\n\nHere is a comprehensive look at his British Open results up to date.\n\nLowry is the odds-on favorite to win the 2024 British Open entering into Day 3 of play. Barring an unforeseen collapse, he should place in the top 10 after the final day of competition.\n\nIf he can outlast his adversaries and lift the Claret Jug once more, Lowry would become the 28th player to win the event multiple times during his career. Notably, he'd join fellow Irishman Padraig Harrington on that list. Harrington won back-to-back British Opens in 2007 (Carnoustie) and 2008 (Royal Birkdale).", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Trainer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martin Trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inishowen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inishowen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Inishowen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Birkdale_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Birkdale Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1draig_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1draig Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnoustie", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnoustie"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Carnoustie"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/Shane%20Lowry%20061024.jpg?itok=ybm7DBsl", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it. I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nBack in 2019, Lowry claimed a first Claret Jug at Royal Portrush following a first round 67. That year, he began the second day one back of American, JB Holmes, with Lowry going on to fire rounds of 67, 63 and 72 to pick up the biggest win of his career.\n\nIn 2024, his current nearest challenges include DP World Tour winner, Daniel Brown, two-time Major champion, Justin Thomas, as well as the likes of Alex Noren, Xander Schauffele and Justin Rose.\n\n\"It's great (leading), but there's three rounds left. If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today,\" stated Lowry, who has one victory this year alongside Rory McIlroy at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans.\n\n\"I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days. Look, I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week.

The 29-year-old from Northallerton shot a bogey-free 65 to take a one-shot lead at the Open Championship.\n\nPlaying in his first major championship, let alone his first Open, Brown led the field in strokes gained off the tee and had a similarly strong putting performance. He gained 4.5 shots on the greens to rank second in strokes gained putting among the field at Royal Troon. Brown is making just his third PGA Tour start, and he's coming off of a made cut at the Scottish Open, but six consecutive missed cuts before that. According to The Athletic contributor Justin Ray, Brown is the only player in the last 30 years to begin his major career with a bogey-free round of 65 or lower.\n\nBehind Brown lurks a player who is more than familiar with the brutal link conditions that lingered at Royal Troon on Thursday. Shane Lowry sits in solo second place at 5-under-par. Lowry, who won the 2019 Open Championship at Royal Portrush in his native Ireland, has become something of a big-stage player in recent years. He has just two wins on the PGA Tour but has the win at Portrush and finished T25 or better in 15 of his last 22 majors.\n\nLowry put himself in good positions all day while so many of his contemporaries found themselves buried in thick gorse and deep bunkers. Meanwhile, he made no mistakes on the greens, leading the field in putting while making all 14 putts inside 10 feet. He birdied No. 7, 8 and 10 to take the lead and settled in with six straight pars before a pin-seeking approach for birdie on 18.\n\nLowry was off to a tough start in 2024, even admitting in his win at the team-event Zurich Classic that teammate Rory McIlroy carried him at times. Since that win, Lowry has gone T6 at the PGA Championship, T19 at the U.S. Open and T9 at the Travelers.\n\nJustin Thomas went into the clubhouse as the leader from the morning slate after a gritty 68 in tougher conditions. Thomas has struggled mightily on links courses in his career. A two-time major winner with a creative, versatile game seemingly well suited for the style, Thomas' best Open finish was T11 2019 and his next best was T40. He's missed three of seven Open cuts, and last year he opened with an 82 at Royal Liverpool which served as a low point.\n\nThursday, though, Thomas masterfully attacked greens and finished holes well. He ranked top 10 in the field in strokes gained approach while making 16-of-18 putts inside 20 feet to capitalize.\n\nMaybe more impressively, Thomas responded when the course got the best of him. After a 4 under start through 10 with a two-shot lead, he double-bogeyed No. 12 and followed that with another bogey on 13. Royal Troon had been devouring players all day at that point, but Thomas finished the round with birdies on 17 and 18.\n\n\"I feel like everything has been turning the right way, and I've been working on the right things,\" Thomas said. \"Just like I said, I haven't really had much to show for it. That's just how this game works sometimes. But I know that I'm close the way it is, and I'm just going to keep playing and not play for results, just play for my game, and it'll take care of itself.\"\n\nOutside of Thomas, the Europeans played well at the most international major. In addition to Lowry and Brown's great starts, Englishman Justin Rose shot a bogey-free 69, and 23-year-old Dane Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard and Swede Alex Noren finished 2-under as well.\n\nRight with them at 69 were Xander Schauffele -- who won the PGA Championship in May -- and Russell Henley looking for his first major victory.\n\nBut many of the biggest stars in the field were seemingly ejected early in the day. The top two players at the U.S. Open last month, McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau, were 7 and 5 over, respectively. McIlroy had just one birdie all day, and DeChambeau was 6 over within eight holes and needed an eagle on 16 to get as low as he did.\n\n\"It's a completely different test,\" DeChambeau said. \"I didn't get any practice in it, and I didn't really play much in the rain. Yeah, it's a difficult test out here. Something I'm not familiar with.\"\n\nTiger Woods, playing all four majors in a year for the first time since 2019, started the day 1 under but quickly dropped eight shots on the next nine holes to ultimately finish 8 over. That leaves him 140th in the field. Woods, 48, hasn't finished better than 47th in the seven majors he's played since his 2021 car crash that severely injured his leg.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\n\"I played really solid, got it around. I felt like I had great control of the ball,\" said Thomas.\n\nWorld number three Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nFive-time major champion Brooks Koepka defied the worst of the weather to post four consecutive bridies between the fourth and the seventh before dropping back to one under.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three 3-putts today. I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today.\"\n\nCameron Smith, champion at St. Andrews two years ago, fared even worse with an 80.\n\nWorld number four Ludvig Aberg was another of the big names to falter in his first ever round at a British Open with a four-over round of 75.\n\nThe Swede's playing partner Jon Rahm is two over, while home favourite Bob McIntyre is in the running after a one-over 72 to back up his victory at last week's Scottish Open.\n\nkca/pi/ea\n\nMore from this section\n\nPresident Joe Biden tests positive for COVID-19 ahead

Just get out of the way. Just get back there. F*** sake.\"\n\nLowry took a drop shot after his ball went into the gorse, but a spectator then found his original ball, meaning it was still in play and it took some time to determine where he could best take a drop. His shot then just shot of the green as he went on to get a double-bogey six.\n\n\"Just there was a cameraman there, and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" the world number 33 explained afterwards. \"As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, my own fault.\"\n\nBut he recovered well from it and did not let it derail his round, which started in calmer conditions than Thursday before the wind got up as it went on. Lowry stated: \"I think the 12th hole for me was key. 12 was playing very difficult, straight into the wind. I hit driver, 4-iron there too, the best shots I've hit all week, to about 30 feet and made par there. From then on, I felt like down out of the left coming in, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nLowry began his round one shot behind England's Daniel Brown, whose late surge on Thursday saw him leapfrog the Irishman at the top of the leaderboard on six-under-par.\n\nThe Offaly native picked up where he left off with a birdie on the par-four first before pars on the second and third. He moved into the outright lead thanks to a brilliant approach to within tap-in range on the par-five fourth just as Brown was starting his own round.\n\nLowry dropped his first shot of the week after finding sand off the tee on the fifth, but added another birdie on the iconic eighth, Postage Stamp, before the double bogey on 11th saw his two-shot lead disappear.\n\nBut he didn't drop another shot for the rest of the round and added two more birdies on the par-five 16th, as well as the final hole, finishing the day on seven-under.\n\nReflecting on his round overall, Lowry said: \"I felt like I went out there, I was in control of my ball, did all the right things for a lot of the round. Then when I got in a bit of trouble, I feel like I really finished the round well.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with the day.

the best start of his major career - with a two-under 69 on Friday morning to move to seven under and bolster his hopes of a second Open victory, five years on from his impressive breakthrough success at Royal Troon.\n\nLowry's closest challenge comes from former world No 1 Justin Rose and fellow Englishman Dan Brown, who led after the opening round of his major debut, while world No 1 Scottie Scheffler is within five of the lead and in tied-fourth as he chases a seventh win in 11 starts.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on,\" Lowry said. \"If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nStrong winds sent scores soaring for the majority of the field, with McIlroy's major drought extending into another season after a second-round 75 left him heading home early on 11 over and Woods missing the cut for a third successive event.\n\nLowry started the day a shot behind Brown but immediately pulled level with Brown by rolling in from 10 feet at the first, then responded to missing a birdie chance from a similar distance at the third by firing a wedge to tap-in range to take advantage of the par-five next.\n\nHe failed to get up and down from the sand at the par-three fifth but birdied the Postage Stamp to reach the turn two ahead, which remained his cushion until he racked up a double-bogey at the 11th after pulling his approach into an unplayable lie in a gorse bush.\n\nLowry ended a run of pars by two-putting from long range to birdie the par-five 16th, before capping off an impressive round by draining a 20-footer at the last to secure a 36-hole major lead for the first time in his career.\n\nBrown was within one of the lead until a penultimate-hole bogey dropped him back to five under, while Rose was the standout performer in the afternoon wave and is also tied-second after mixing four birdies with a lone dropped shot in the worst of the conditions.\n\nHorschel matched Rose's 68 to leave him on two under with Dean Burmester and Scottie Scheffler, who was within four of the lead until a closing bogey dropped him back to a share of fourth, while Patrick Cantlay and Xander Schauffele - Woods' playing partners - sit in tied-seventh alongside Corey Conners and Jason Day.\n\nJoaquin Niemann recovered from a quintuple-bogey at the par-three eighth to salvage a 71, keeping him at level par, while former major champions Jon Rahm, Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka and Collin Morikawa all head into the weekend on one over.\n\nLast week's Genesis Scottish Open champion Robert MacIntyre recovered from being eight over after four holes to salvage a four-over 75 and get back to five over, although tough conditions saw seven of the world's top 12 miss the cut.\n\nReigning US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau and Sweden's Ludvig Aberg fell to nine over and world No 5 Wyndham Clark also exited after a second-round 80, while McIlroy's bid for an elusive fifth major continues after a nightmare start to his Friday.\n\nMcIlroy's hopes of progressing were halted by a triple-bogey at the par-five fourth, with the 2014 Open champion admitting that conditions got the better of him after missing the cut by five shots despite two birdies in his last holes.\n\nViktor Hovland, Sahith Theegala and Tommy Fleetwood also failed to reach the weekend, while Woods' major season is over after registering just one birdie in a six-over 77.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahith_Theegala", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahith Theegala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Hovland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viktor Hovland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Cantlay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Cantlay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/1600x900/skysports-shane-lowry-golf_6632442.jpg?20240719202139", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on.

But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\n\"I played really solid, got it around. I felt like I had great control of the ball,\" said Thomas.\n\nWorld number three Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack.\n\nFive-time major champion Brooks Koepka defied the worst of the weather to post four consecutive bridies between the fourth and the seventh before dropping back to one under.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with a 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods. \"I had three 3-putts today.

I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole,\" Lowry said of the 11, which runs parallel to railroad tracks. \"I had a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right [by a cameraman] just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\nLowry's shot wasn't just left; it landed in the gorse. Fearing it lost, he hit a provisional ball onto the green. When asked if he wanted to search for the wayward shot or take the penalty and play the provisional, he told the official not to look for the ball.\n\n\"Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So, apparently you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it,\" said Lowry, who was forced to play his original ball and eventually took a penalty drop after a complicated ruling that took nearly 20 minutes.\n\nLowry made a double bogey on No. 11 to fall into a share of the lead with Daniel Brown, but it was how he responded to that miscue that gave him confidence the rest of the round.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6.

McIlroy was unfortunate as his near-perfect tee shot slipped off the green into a bunker, which he took two attempts to get out of, to post a double bogey five.\n\nAnother double bogey followed at the 11th, while he also dropped shots at the 10th, 15th and 18th. \"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut,\" said McIlroy.\n\n\"I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more and feel like I have half a chance.\"\n\nWoods wobbles\n\nDeChambeau had been the form player in the majors so far this year, despite his defection to the breakaway LIV Tour.\n\nThe American finished sixth at the Masters and runner-up in the USPGA Championship before claiming his second US Open.\n\nHowever, his struggles with the windy conditions of links golf continued as he was six over par for his opening nine holes.\n\nDeChambeau battled back on the back nine as an eagle on the 17th helped him to a 76.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" said DeChambeau.\n\n\"I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home'. But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nThomas recovered from his own double bogey at the 12th to post a 68, which was 14 shots better than his opening round at Royal Liverpool 12 months ago.\n\n\"I played really solid, got it around. I felt like I had great control of the ball,\" said Thomas.\n\nWorld number three Schauffele continued his fine form in recent months as he dropped just one shot to put himself among the chasing pack. Five-time major champion Brooks Koepka defied the worst of the weather to post four consecutive birdies between the fourth and the seventh before dropping back to one under.\n\nTiger Woods had hit back at suggestions from former European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie that he should retire, but the 15-time major champion failed to prove he can still be competitive with an 8-over 79.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" said Woods.\n\n\"I had three 3-putts today.

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't.\n\n\"[But] I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And I felt like Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too, he kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.

I don't miss anything! I'd give it a go,' he smiled.\n\nHeading out yesterday just before 3pm, Lowry knew the state of play on day one at the Open.\n\nThree under par was the clubhouse target set by Justin Thomas while a number of contenders, not least Rory McIlroy, were struggling.\n\nThe wind that shifted to the south presented a different links challenge but that was no worry to him. If anything, it was in his favour as he had experienced here on a recent reconnaissance.\n\nThe skies were grey, the temperatures cool. Again, that was not unfamiliar for someone weaned on Irish weather.\n\nLowry's stats this year on the PGA Tour have indicated a guy in top form with his driver, and approach shots to the green.\n\nWhat has held him back from returning to the winner's enclosure has been a chilly putter. Following a recent improvement, he plugged it in yesterday. The heat was searing.\n\nFrom the moment, he brushed in a seven-footer on the opening hole for par, after finding a bunker off the tee, Lowry held a wand in his wands. Even Harry Potter wouldn't have dared take him on.\n\nOn greens whose contours had confused so many, Lowry was like Merlin. Simply magical. He holed over 40 yards of putts, some for pars but more for birdies.\n\nThree of them were drained on the front nine, as he matched Thomas' outward score of 33.\n\nLowry holed from nine feet at the long fourth for birdie, from 11 feet for another at the seventh, followed by a nine-footer for a two at the Postage Stamp, where others including McIlroy, came unstuck.\n\nSuddenly, Thomas, the dual US PGA champion, had company on three under par, after leading on his own for seven hours.\n\nAt the ninth, Lowry chipped close and dialled in a seven-footer for par. He had a look about him, not unlike Portrush five years ago.\n\nAnd they kept coming. He extended his run of single putts to six holes in a row, as he saved par from distance at the 10th, picked up a birdie on the Railway, and saved himself on the difficult 12th from just under four paces.\n\nThe touch cooled slightly down the stretch where Lowry gave himself decent birdie looks on 15, 16, and 17 before stitching his approach to 18 and calmly rolling in a five-footer for a 66, five under par.\n\nIt was his lowest opening round in the Open and a clear signal of intent as he seeks to add to his 2019 triumph in Portrush.\n\nUp ahead, P\u00e1draig Harrington, the only other dual Irish winner of the Open, drew on all his craft to keep his round intact and sign for a 72.\n\nA bogey-bogey start might have upset others with less know-how but Harrington didn't flinch.\n\nHe won his Opens in breezy weather, with a fleck of rain, so Troon was no torment, although the strength of the wind, especially on the front nine, even took him aback at times.\n\n'I'd chances. I hit a lot of nice shots and put myself in great positions all the way home. I'm just a little disappointed with the score at the end.\n\n'I had a three-putt par on 16 and the putt on the 18 looked like it was going to fall in.'\n\n'At my age, trying to shoot 63 can seem difficult; trying to shoot 68 or 69 is not as intimidating.\n\n'There will be a few people scratching their heads. It's links golf. t was a weird day. I'd settle for these conditions for the rest of the week.'\n\nTom McKibbin's dawn patrol ended with a 72, including a prestige two at the Postage Stamp. On his Open debut, it was a made the cut since 2018 decent score that left him nearer first than last.\n\nMcKibbin rued his decision to try and carry the burn on the par five 16th which led to a bogey. He'll take that experience, and more, into battle today as he aims to make the weekend.\n\nDarren Clarke (77) has a bit more to do but the 2011 champion lit up the links on the Postage Stamp where he spun his ball to within three inches of the cup.\n\nAt the same hole, McIlroy faltered with a five. Instead it was 'Detective Lowry' who cracked the Troon code.\n\nElsewhere, Robert MacIntyre felt his game was close to perfect despite struggling on the putting greens.\n\nThe home favourite came into the event on a high after his triumph at last week's Scottish Open but had to settle for a oneover-par 72 in difficult conditions on day one in Ayrshire.\n\n'I thought it was almost perfect,' said the 27-year-old from Oban, who delayed his arrival at Troon after celebrating into the night following Sunday's win at the Renaissance Club.\n\n'The putter didn't turn up today but I thought tee to green was absolutely superb, especially that front nine, with the wind in out of the right. It wasn't comfortable at all.\n\n'Obviously the prep wasn't great, but that's by the by,' he continued.\n\n'I thought we prepared well Tuesday, Wednesday and, with the conditions out there, and the way I'm swinging the golf club and moving the ball in the air, fighting the winds, it was close to perfect.'", "source": {"uri": "extra.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Extra.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_equipment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf equipment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1draig_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1draig Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_MacIntyre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert MacIntyre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_McKibbin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan McKibbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_McKibbin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom McKibbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Clarke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darren Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oban", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oban"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shen-lowry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The 29-year-old from Northallerton shot a bogey-free 65 to take a one-shot lead at the Open Championship.\n\nIn his first Open, let alone playing in his first major championship, Brown led the field in strokes gained off the tee and had a similarly strong performance. He gained 4.5 shots on the greens and tied for second in strokes gained putting on the field at Royal Troon. Brown is making his third PGA Tour start and is coming off a cut at the Scottish Open, but has missed six cuts in a row before that. According to Athletic Contributor Justin Ray Brown is the only player in the last 30 years to start his major career with a bogey-free round of 65 or less.\n\nHiding behind Brown is a player familiar with the brutal contact conditions that lasted at Royal Troon on Thursday. Shane Lowry sits tied for second at 5-under-par. Lowry, who won the 2019 Open Championship at Royal Portrush in his native Ireland, has become a big stage player in recent years. He has two wins on the PGA Tour, but has won at Portrush and has finished T25 or better in 15 of his last 22 majors.\n\nLowry kept himself in good condition throughout the day, while many of his contemporaries were buried in thick ravines and deep bunkers. Meanwhile, he made no mistakes on the greens, leading the field while making 14 putts within 10 feet. He finished 7th, 8th and 10th.\n\nLowry has had a tough start to 2024, as he admitted in his win at the Zurich Classic team event, with teammate Rory McIlroy taking him on at times. Since that win, Lowry has gone T6 at the PGA Championship, T19 at the US Open and T9 at the Travelers.\n\nJustin Thomas headed into the clubhouse leading the morning slate after a 68 in tough conditions. Thomas struggled a lot in his life with connection courses. Perfectly suited to the two-time major winner's creative, versatile playing style, Thomas' best Open finish is T11 in 2019 and his next best is T40. He has missed three of seven Open cuts, and last year he opened with an 82 at Royal Liverpool, which was the lowest point.\n\nThursday, however, Thomas hit the greens efficiently and finished the holes well. He finished in the top 10 in the field in strokes gained while making 16 of 18 putts within 20 feet.\n\nPerhaps most interestingly, Thomas responded when the course got the best of him. After opening the first 10 at 4-under with a two-shot lead, he finished No. He double-bogeyed the 12th and followed it up with another bogey on the 13th. Royal Troon had been devouring players all day at that point, but Thomas finished the round with birdies. 17 and 18.\n\n\"I feel like everything is back on track and I'm doing the right things,\" Thomas said. \"Like I said, I don't have a lot to show for it. This is how the game plays out sometimes. But I know I'm close the way I am, I'll just keep playing, not playing for results, playing for my game and it will take care of itself.\"\n\nOutside of Thomas, the Europeans played well in the international majors. In addition to great starts by Lowry and Brown, England's Justin Rose shot a bogey-free 69, and 23-year-old Dane Nikolaj H\u00f8jgaard and Swede Alex Noren also finished at 2-under.\n\nXander Schauffele -- who won the PGA Championship in May with them at age 69 -- and Russell Henley were looking for his first major win.\n\nBut many of the industry's biggest stars were seemingly kicked out. At last month's US Open, the top two players, McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau, were at 7 and 5 over, respectively. McIlroy had just one birdie all day, and DeChambeau shot 6 through eight holes and, like him, needed an eagle on 16.\n\n\"It's a completely different test,\" DeCambeau said. \"I haven't had any practice in it and I haven't played much in the rain. Yes, here it is a tough test. Something I'm not familiar with.\"\n\nTiger Woods, playing all four majors in a year for the first time since 2019, started off on Day 1 but quickly dropped eight shots over the next nine holes to eventually finish 8 over. This places him 140th in the field. Woods, 48, has never finished better than 47th in the seven majors he has played since suffering a serious leg injury in a 2021 car accident.", "source": {"uri": "highlandstoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mid Florida Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_lindsey@highlandstoday.com", "name": "Joe Lindsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Liverpool_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Liverpool Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/07/18180630/Daniel-Brown-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

As all eventual major winners tend to do, though, he leveraged what could have been the long unwinding of a great week and turned it into a second consecutive round in the 60s. At 7 under, Lowry holds a two-stroke lead over Justin Rose and Daniel Brown heading into the weekend at Royal Troon.\n\nAfter a first-nine 34, Lowry looked well on his way to another great Open round to follow the 66 he shot late Thursday. However, the nasty 11th hole caused him all kind of problems (and it could have been even worse). After his tee shot next to the train tracks settled up the right side in the tall, wispy fescue, Lowry smother hooked his second into the left gorse. This led to some hollering at a camera operator who apparently affected his play. (Lowry later admitted he was just looking for somebody to blame.)\n\nA few moments after his second shot disappeared into the nasty gorse on the other side of the hole, Lowry dropped a ball in that same spot and belted what was then his fourth shot onto the green. He gave himself a putt at making bogey.\n\nIt all should have been so straightforward ... except someone found his original second shot deep in the gorse, and according to the rules, he had to play that ball instead of the provisional he had hit onto the green. The big problem? There was no way to play it. He had to take an unplayable on that original ball and drop what looked to be 30 or 40 yards back on line with the pin. From there, he was hitting his fourth, and he made a double-bogey 6.\n\nIf all of that sounds like a mess, well, yeah.\n\n\"I did the hard part,\" Lowry said. \"I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole. I did [have] a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\n\n\"Then from there, I hit a great provisional. The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said, 'No.' So I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there and somebody had found it. So, apparently, we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it. Which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes, it was whatever it was, of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing. And I felt like [my caddie] did a great job, too, just kind of -- he kept telling me [that] we have loads of time. 'We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.'\"\n\nIt took Lowry approximately 30 minutes to play that 11th hole -- 20 minutes elapsed between his second shot and his third -- and everything seemed heightened in the moment because, you know, he was leading The Open at the time all of it was taking place.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nSituations like these can affect players mentally and emotionally even more than it does their scorecards. In Lowry's case, he was able to persevere. He proceeded to hit some filthy flighted irons the whole way home and regained both strokes on two more birdies coming in with an exclamation point at the last.\n\n\"Sometimes, you are in a frame of mind that it works better ... you know, you get on with it better than other times,\" Lowry explained \"This week in my head feels like that where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there. Almost ready for ... anything that's thrown at me. I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\"\n\nLowry's two-stroke advantage is his second 36-hole lead at a major. The last came at the 2019 Open Championship when he ultimately hoisted the Claret Jug. If he captures another, he will be the first player who already has already won an Open to capture a second jug since Ernie Els in 2012.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-stroke_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-stroke engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Els", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Els"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/19/f6ea9f06-f9fb-4928-a75b-1367ed571e8e/thumbnail/1200x675/f23f3cd51bc086a5a6d313dab3cace98/shane-lowry-open-r2-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Another 25-foot birdie effort at the 13th put him into red figures.\n\nAfter last year's runner-up's spot at Royal Liverpool which completed his set of second-place finishes at all the majors, former world No.1 Day is now looking to go one better at Troon and add a second big-four crown to the PGA Championship he won nine years ago.\n\nBut Lowry remains the man to beat after the most eventful round in which he grabbed the lead, had it torn away from him with a double-bogey at the 11th, then rallied to take control again.\n\nThe Portrush champion from 2019 had recorded three birdies before the turn to take the reins from Brown, who had led with his overnight 65.\n\nLowry had dropped his first shot of the tournament after 23 holes when finding the bunker at the par-three fifth, but otherwise looked in complete control as he sank birdie putts from nine feet at the first, tap-in range at the long fourth and 11 feet at the ninth.\n\nBut he then pulled his second shot at the notorious 'Railway' hole into the gorse, took a penalty drop and hit his fourth on to the green, only for his original ball to be found by a spectator.\n\nThat meant it was still in play and, after a long delay while it was determined where he could best take a drop, Lowry hit his approach just short of the green and eventually completed a double-bogey six to fall back to the joint-lead on five under.\n\nIt only brought the best golf out of the 37-year-old, as he birdied both the 16th and last holes.\n\nLowry had been playing alongside Australia's 2022 champ Cam Smith, whose miserable Open continued following his first-round 80, his worst ever round in a major.\n\nAfter his nine bogeys and a triple-bogey on Thursday, five more bogeys on Friday were offset only by the blessed relief of a couple of birdies, but at 12 over following his second-round 74, he was set to miss the cut by eight strokes.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

So I assumed that was OK.\n\n\"Then we get down there and somebody had found it, so apparently you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't.\n\n\"[But] I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes of seeing where I could drop I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And I felt like Darren [Reynolds, his caddie] did a great job too, he kept telling me we have loads of time, we don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament. I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with how things have gone. The job tomorrow is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.\n\n\"If I give myself a chance on Sunday I know I can do it and that's as good as a position to be in as any.\"\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler, fellow American Billy Horschel and South Africa's Dean Burmester were five shots off the lead on two under par, with Jason Day and Xander Schauffele among those on one under.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Howell_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Howell (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Composition", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Composition", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/8705d18c23c18622c14f127f004d9f9b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Better still, he could pick the brains of an Englishman ranked 272nd in the world.\n\nTo see Lowry navigate Royal Troon on Thursday was to witness a masterclass in the arts of putting and taming the elements on a foul day. That his clubhouse lead of five under par was then overtaken in the dying light by Daniel Brown was just remarkable.\n\nAn introduction to Brown would be necessary at this point. Aged 29, he has never previously contested a major and his previous eight tournaments on the DP World Tour included six missed cuts. In compiling a six-under loop of 65 he stepped out of relative anonymity and into the spotlight in the most wonderful way.\n\n'You've got those bright yellow scoreboards out there so it's hard to miss (that he leads the Open), but I felt comfortable out there,' he said.\n\nBrown had the benefit of a final hour where the wind and rain had largely vanished, but the majority of his round was contested in the same gusts of 25 miles an hour that battered the rest. It was a stunning performance.\n\nRory McIlroy endured a nightmare first day at the Open, enduring a hangover from the USA\n\nThe Northern Irishman admitted that he was not super 'confident' coming into the Open\n\nMeanwhile, Shane Lowry put on a masterclass in the arts of putting and taming the elements\n\nHe added: 'I'm very excited, but you've got to keep your feet on the ground, so I'm just going to go out and do the best I can.'\n\nWhile Brown's fabulous presence at the top is unlikely to send tremors through the field, Lowry is a different kind of beast altogether. As the winner of this tournament in 2019, the field know he can go the distance. Two further back was a resurgent Justin Thomas, ahead of a cluster on two under par featuring Justin Rose, Xander Schauffele and, magnificently, another Englishman in Joe Dean, who drives a delivery truck for the Morrisons supermarket chain.\n\nFor McIlroy, it was quite the opposite sort of experience and an awfully underwhelming response to his final-day collapse at the US Open last month.\n\nIf there was a single point of accuracy in his day, it was delivered in the media tent after the last of the 78 strokes. 'All I need to focus on is trying to make the cut,' he said, and really there is not much more within his reach.\n\nTo pick out his high point would be easy enough - that would be the birdie at the third, because it was the only one he scored. The lows? For that we might head straight to the most iconic hole of this course, the eighth, otherwise termed the Postage Stamp for its tiny length of 120 yards.\n\nBy the time McIlroy got there, he was even for his round, but the crosswind sucked his ball to the right of the green and then it began the slow roll of the damned towards the bunker. His recovery attempt landed almost precisely where his tee shot had dropped and took a familiar journey back to his feet - a double bogey went on the card.\n\nAnother followed at the brutally tough 11th, named Railway, for its proximity to the track that serves the route between Ayr and Glasgow and runs down the right of the fairway.\n\nWith a strong wind off the left, McIlroy sliced it so far out of bounds it crossed to the wrong side of the tracks and the four-time major winner ultimately scribbled a second double in the space of four holes. Further bogeys at 15 and 18 left on seven over and in possession of his worst major scorecard since his opening 79 at Royal Portrush in the 2019 Open.\n\nDaniel Brown has never previously contested a major but carded 65 to astonish onlookers\n\nHe could only manage a double bogey at the iconic Postage Stamp hole, which undid his progress\n\nHe made the 11th hole, a 500-yard brute nicknamed Railway, to look unplayable on Thursday\n\nTo reiterate, that was Lowry's year. The weather was rough then, too, as it was when he won the Irish Open as an amateur in 2009 - links golf isn't for everyone and more so when the skies are foul. Where others squirm, he excels.\n\nThe 37-year-old has had a spring in his step since he got here, declaring the only prizes that matter to him these days are those won at majors and the Ryder Cup. He has put himself in early contention with the kind of putting that carried him close at the USPGA Championship in May.\n\nWhile his drives were pummelled to all corners on what is typically the easier front nine portion of the course, which uncharacteristically was played into the wind on Thursday, his approach play and work on the greens was immense. His first birdie came at the fifth before 10-footers at seven and eight took him to three under.\n\nPar was then saved with a 23-foot putt at 10 and a birdie followed from 20 foot at the next. With the wind easing slightly, he held on through the gorse-covered inward nine and closed with an exceptional approach for a tap-in birdie at the last.\n\nLowry said: 'I wouldn't say I was the most confident ever going into today. I'm really happy'\n\nAstonishingly, he was passed an hour later by Brown. Granted, the Englishman was assisted by easing winds, but his round was immense. Stiffing his tee shot to two feet at the par-three fifth carried him to two under but he only caught attention when he nailed putts from 35 and 42 feet for birdies at 10 and 11. He gained two more in the final three holes.\n\nWith American golfers pursuing their first clean sweep of the majors since 1982, the US charge was led by Thomas. Having opened with an 82 at Hoylake last year, a nadir in his run of five cuts in the past seven majors, he shot 68 to go three under. Schauffele, the reigning USPGA champion, was a shot back.\n\nWorld No 1 Scottie Scheffler closed with a birdie for 70 and Bryson DeChambeau shot 76.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType":

The fans at Royal Troon burst into applause when the Irishman birdied his final hole, reminiscent of his victory march at Royal Portrush five years ago when he secured his first major title.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy, but it's only one day,\" Lowry told reporters after his five-under round left him second, one shot behind England's Daniel Brown. \"We've got three more days. I kept telling myself that out there because the crowd felt like they were getting very excited... it felt more like the weekend.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots.

I saw the golf course in every possible wind.\" he explained. \"That preparation seems to be paying off today.\"\n\nAccording to Lowry, the fundamentals of the game remain the same regardless of weather. \"If you're not striking the ball well, you're not going to control your ball,\" he said. Lowry's effective putting led to five birdies, and he noted his quick adjustment to the European greens after playing in the U.S. PGA Tour. \"My speed control was very good, and I saw my lines well,\" he noted. \"It feels like links greens when you start to see your lines, the hole feels quite big.\"", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/30_04_2024_12_44_39_865891.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Justin Thomas is alone in third after a 3-under 68.\n\nA one-time winner on the DP World Tour, the 29-year-old Brown had a round to remember in his major championship debut.\n\n\"Amazing, isn't it?\" Brown said. \"I was nervous on the first tee, obviously it being my first major, but I hit a few nice shots early, so I kind of got settled into the round pretty quick.\"\n\nAfter playing the front nine in 2 under, Brown briefly tied Lowry's lead at 4 under with a pair of improbable birdie putts -- from nearly 35 feet at No. 10 and about 42 feet at No. 11.\n\nLowry went on to stick his second shot at the par-4 18th to within five feet of the pin, prompting a roar from the crowd, and set up a go-ahead birdie to retake sole possession of the lead.\n\n\"It's only one day. We've got three more days,\" Lowry said. \"I kept telling myself that out there because for some reason I felt like the crowd were getting very excited out there.\"\n\nBut Brown stayed steady on the back nine as visibility began to fade. He recovered from a wayward second shot at the par-5 16th and sank a 13-footer for birdie to tie Lowry again. Then he drained an 8-foot putt at about 9:30 p.m. local time to take the top spot for himself.\n\nAfter missing the fairway and green and the par-4 10th, Lowry made a crucial save by sinking a 24-foot putt for par. He took that momentum to the 11th, where his 20\u00bd-foot birdie putt fell to give the tournament its first new outright leader in several hours.\n\nThomas, a two-time major champion who has struggled in recent seasons, set the early pace by making seven birdies to offset two bogeys and a double.\n\nReigning PGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele contended for the lead with three birdies in his first 11 holes before settling for a 2-under 69.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler finished birdie-bogey-birdie to post a 1-under 70. Past major winners Brooks Koepka, Matt Fitzpatrick of England and Adam Scott of Australia also shot 70.\n\nRory McIlroy of Northern Ireland is in danger of missing Friday's cut after a disastrous 7-over 78. Tiger Woods similarly struggled to an 8-over 79.

And, in an opening round at the Open where the wind played tricks with the minds of many, Shane Lowry - at home in the dunes and with the taste of sea salt in the air - navigated a route to the business end in this 152nd edition of golf's oldest Major with a wonderfully crafted, bogey-free five-under-par 66 on the links by the Firth of Clyde.\n\nLowry's score left him alone in second, one shot behind 29-year-old Englishman Daniel Brown, playing in the penultimate group and who finished in the gathering gloom.\n\nFor Brown, winner of last year's ISPS Handa World Invitational at Galgorm Castle in Ballymenaand making his debut appearance in a Major having came through final qualifying, it represented a remarkable turnaround in form given he'd missed six cuts and withdrew in seven events until making the cut at last week's Scottish Open.\n\nLowry seemed at peace, in a serene place. His course management was exemplary. When he could be aggressive, he was. When he needed safety, he took that route.\n\nOn a day when the wind shifted - compared to the practice rounds - to cause issues for many, their minds unable to comprehend the different challenge of this famed old course, Lowry, a Claret Jug champion at Portrush in 2019, stuck to the task. There were times when the club twirled in satisfaction and others when he followed iron shots before they'd even found the green so clued in was he, in his own zone.\n\nAnd, too, there were those times when the putter acted as a wand. Indeed, Lowry single-putted six straight greens from the seventh - a run that brought birdie-birdie-par-par-birdie-par - in a round where he took 25 putts and ran up some 128 feet of putts made.\n\nLowry's feat of going bogey-free was matched by only two other players, Brown and Justin Rose, who had a 69. The scores of others gave perspective to Lowry's opening round. Bryson DeChambeau had a 76. Rory McIlroy a 78. Wyndham Clark also a 78.\n\nJustin Thomas had a 68 but it included a double-bogey. Matt Wallace reached four under through eight holes only to triple bogey the ninth after finding a gorse bush. Such penalties were frequent, as the course - aided by the wind which exceeded 25 miles an hour in the early afternoon only to lessen to around 15mph later in the day - asked questions that many simply couldn't answer.\n\nLowry, though, had the answers. A couple of weeks ago he made an advance reconnaissance visit to Troon and, by good fortune, the second of those two days of preparation was spent in the southerly wind that had been absent through the practice days.\n\nBut such meteorological factors were just one part of it. The fact was that Lowry played shots with an assuredness and a calmness that had his caddie Darren Reynolds often taking the club to be put in the bag while his player was already walking after the shot.\n\nLowry's first birdie came on the par-five fourth hole but the real work was accomplished on the tough stretch of holes from the seventh to the 12th, where he single-putted time and time again.\n\nThree of those times were for birdies (on the seventh, eighth and 11th) but the others were for par that kept the momentum going. Two of those putts, indeed, were from over 20 feet (on the 10th and 11th) and ironically he later had birdie putts coming home that grazed the cup. He finished in style with a beautifully struck approach to five feet on the last to close with a birdie that had those spectators in the grandstand cheering as if it was a Sunday.\n\n\"The walk down 18 was actually pretty cool. I said to Billy Foster [Matt Fitzpatrick's caddie], we walked down beside each other, and it's the greatest walk in golf. And I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house, and that's the plan, to try to get to do that again,\" revealed Lowry.\n\nIt felt like it, for a time. Yet the task for Lowry is only one-quarter done with most of the work in front of him.\n\nP\u00e1draig Harrington overcame a bogey-bogey start to his own round only to grind out a 72 that could indeed have been even better and he will look to move up the leaderboard. But he had thoughts for Lowry too: \"When he gets in front, he's good. He generally stays up there. He's a front-runner. For him, he needs to get going. He's not someone who generally chases from behind. It's very positive for him.\"\n\nLowry's form on the PGA Tour this season has included a win (in the Zurich Classic with McIlroy) and a record-equalling low round in a Major (a 62 in the third round where he finished tied-sixth behind Xander Schauffele). The return to the European side of the Atlantic has seen him continue that strong form seamlessly, able to account for the slower green speeds thanks to his diligent preparation which also included a four-day trip to Hogs Head in Co Kerry last week.\n\n\"I feel like links greens when you start to see your lines, the hole feels quite big, so it felt like that today, and long may it continue,\" said Lowry.\n\nLowry's opening 66 was his best first round in any Major. He knows what's ahead, what he has to do:\n\n\"There's three rounds left. If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days.\n\n\"Look, I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week. This is obviously a great start to do that.\n\n\"It's just hard to get there [in front]. You're going against the best golfers in the world, it's hard to get to the front. When you do get to the front, you kind of have to keep going and keep your foot down, and yeah, see where it leaves you at the weekend.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC_Invitational", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WGC Invitational"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firth of Clyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1draig_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1draig Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County Kerry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Kerry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/TLHZHSN72J7AJWRAG6ETOJZ44U.jpg?smart=true&auth=4d490e1777e9e31d11035178c9c7b855f4519a344dd14e98ff9596d02d8c79d1&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Lowry, the 2019 champion, rolled in a superb 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th green to complete a two-under 69 to move to seven under, two shots clear of overnight leader Dan Brown.\n\nQualifier Brown, who made a late move on Thursday to grab the lead, had dropped one shot through 12 holes. American Scheffler was warming to the task of lifting the Claret Jug for the first time although a bogey at the 18th rather jolted his serene progress on the Ayrshire coast.\n\nEngland's Justin Rose was also impressive as the former U.S. Open champion reached four under early in his second round having gone 25 holes without a single dropped shot. Conditions were calmer for the early starters on Friday although winds were expected to increase throughout the day.\n\nLowry made birdies at the first and fourth and after dropping a shot at the fifth he made birdie on the treacherous par-three eighth known as the Postage Stamp. His only moment of concern was a double-bogey on the 11th but he quickly shrugged that off and made birdie at the 16th before his majestic finish on the last hole.\n\n'It was pretty good, it was tough out there,' Lowry said. 'The wind wasn't quite as strong as yesterday but it was still tricky. The 11th was a bit of a disaster but I handled that well and managed to finish nicely.' Scheffler, who has six wins on the PGA Tour this season including The Masters, plotted his way around in impressive fashion with three birdies although he was left frustrated following a bogey five at the 18th after finding a fairway bunker.\n\nRose, who had to qualify this year, rolled back the years with some near-perfect golf to move into contention. Once again he showed the value of staying out of trouble as he made two birdies and six pars in his first eight holes.\n\nSeveral players made use of the relatively benign early conditions, including American Billy Horschel who moved to two under after a three-under 68. Fellow American Patrick Cantlay also shot at 68 to move to one under, as did Australia's Jason Day.\n\nThere was to be no miraculous recovery for Tiger Woods though as the American great bowed out with a disappointing round of 77 after carding 79 on Thursday.

And, in an opening round at the Open where the wind played tricks with the minds of many, Shane Lowry - at home in the dunes and with the taste of sea salt in the air - navigated a route to the top of the leaderboard in this 152nd edition of golf's oldest Major with a wonderfully crafted, bogey-free five-under-par 66 on the links by the Firth of Clyde.\n\nLowry seemed at peace, in a serene place. His course management was exemplary. When he could be aggressive, he was. When he needed safety, he took that route.\n\nOn a day when the wind shifted - compared to the practice rounds - to cause issues for many, their minds unable to comprehend the different challenge of this famed old course, Lowry, a Claret Jug champion at Portrush in 2019, stuck to the task. There were times when the club twirled in satisfaction and others when he followed iron shots before they'd even found the green so clued in was he, in his own zone.\n\nAnd, too, there were those times when the putter acted as a wand. Indeed, Lowry single-putted six straight greens from the seventh - a run that brought birdie-birdie-par-par-birdie-par - in a round where he took 25 putts and ran up some 128 feet of putts made.\n\nThe scores of others gave perspective to Lowry's opening round. Bryson DeChambeau had a 76. Rory McIlroy a 78. Wyndham Clark also a 78.\n\nJustin Thomas had a 68 but it included a double-bogey. Matt Wallace reached four under through eight holes only to triple bogey the ninth after finding a gorse bush. Such penalties were frequent, as the course - aided by the wind which exceeded 25 miles an hour in the early afternoon only to lessen to around 15mph later in the day - asked questions that many simply couldn't answer.\n\nLowry, though, had the answers. A couple of weeks ago he made an advance reconnaissance visit to Troon and, by good fortune, the second of those two days of preparation was spent in the southerly wind that had been absent through the practice days.\n\nBut such meteorological factors were just one part of it. The fact was that Lowry played shots with an assuredness and a calmness that had his caddie Darren Reynolds often taking the club to be put in the bag while his player was already walking after the shot.\n\nLowry's first birdie came on the par-five fourth hole but the real work was accomplished on the tough stretch of holes from the seventh to the 12th, where he single-putted time and time again.\n\nThree of those times were for birdies (on the seventh, eighth and 11th) but the others were for par that kept the momentum going. Two of those putts, indeed, were from over 20 feet (on the 10th and 11th) and ironically he later had birdie putts coming home that grazed the cup. He finished in style with a beautifully struck approach to five feet on the last to close with a birdie that had those spectators in the grandstand cheering as if it was a Sunday.\n\n\"The walk down 18 was actually pretty cool. I said to Billy Foster [Matt Fitzpatrick's caddie], we walked down beside each other, and it's the greatest walk in golf. And I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house, and that's the plan, to try to get to do that again,\" revealed Lowry.\n\nIt felt like it, for a time. Yet the task for Lowry is only one-quarter done with most of the work in front of him.\n\nP\u00e1draig Harrington overcame a bogey-bogey start to his own round only to grind out a 72 that could indeed have been even better and he will look to move up the leaderboard. But he had thoughts for Lowry too: \"When he gets in front, he's good. He generally stays up there. He's a front-runner. For him, he needs to get going. He's not someone who generally chases from behind. It's very positive for him.\"\n\nLowry's form on the PGA Tour this season has included a win (in the Zurich Classic with McIlroy) and a record-equalling low round in a Major (a 62 in the third round where he finished tied-sixth behind Xander Schauffele). The return to the European side of the Atlantic has seen him continue that strong form seamlessly, able to account for the slower green speeds thanks to his diligent preparation which also included a four-day trip to Hogs Head in Co Kerry last week.\n\n\"I feel like links greens when you start to see your lines, the hole feels quite big, so it felt like that today, and long may it continue,\" said Lowry.\n\nLowry's opening 66 was his best first round in any Major. He knows what's ahead, what he has to do:\n\n\"There's three rounds left. If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days.\n\n\"Look, I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week. This is obviously a great start to do that.\n\n\"It's just hard to get there [in front]. You're going against the best golfers in the world, it's hard to get to the front. When you do get to the front, you kind of have to keep going and keep your foot down, and yeah, see where it leaves you at the weekend.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firth_of_Clyde", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firth of Clyde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Thomas_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Thomas (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Wallace_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Wallace (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Fitzpatrick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Classic_of_New_Orleans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zurich Classic of New Orleans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1draig_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1draig Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Kerry", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County Kerry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Kerry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/TLHZHSN72J7AJWRAG6ETOJZ44U.jpg?smart=true&auth=4d490e1777e9e31d11035178c9c7b855f4519a344dd14e98ff9596d02d8c79d1&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Reaching 7 under at the 2024 Open Championship, the Irishman grabbed the solo lead at Royal Troon and now firmly stands is the man to beat heading into the weekend in Scotland.\n\n\"It was good. I felt like, I went out there, I was in control of my ball, did all the right things for a lot of the round,\" Lowry said. \"Then when I got in a bit of trouble, I feel like I really finished the round well.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with the day. To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here. It's why we're here. Yeah, I'll sit back and watch a bit of golf in the afternoon and see where it leaves me come the end of the day and get out there tomorrow. The job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.\"\n\nLowry holds the second 36-hole lead in his major career; the other occurrence came in 2019 when he went on to raise the Claret Jug at Royal Portrush. If the Irish standout is going to do the same at Royal Troon, he will return to Northern Ireland next year as a rare double defender -- the last man to win at Portrush, and simultaneously, the last man to hoist the Claret Jug.\n\nPlenty of golf separates Lowry from the winner's circle, but Friday's 11th hole could indicate how the Irishman will react over the weekend should he face adversity again.\n\nHitting his second shot into a gorse bush, Lowry dropped a provisional at his feet and struck his presumed fourth shot. Settling close to the pin, Lowry's approach looked to be enough to get him with minimal damage done. However, as he was walking toward the green, he was made aware that his original golf ball was found.\n\nHaving to go through the process of identifying his golf ball, weighing his options and taking an unplayable lie, Lowry went onto make double bogey. He remained cool, calm and collected, and soon, he got those strokes back with birdies on Nos. 16 and 18 to close out his round.\n\nLowry's temperament will need to remain steady entering Moving Day as this week's surprise contender, Daniel Brown, does not appear to be going anywhere quite yet. The 18-hole leader and a more acclaimed fellow Englishman, ustin Rose, will pose as Lowry's closest competitor at 5 under just ahead of modern heavyweights like Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Jon Rahm.\n\n\"I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone,\" Lowry said. \"Yeah, I'm pretty happy with how things have gone.\"\n\n1. Shane Lowry (-7): If Thursday was defined by his putting, Friday was defined by his ball striking. Lowry hit nine fairways, 15 greens in regulation and led the field in strokes gained approach. Making this even more impressive is that Lowry's second into the gorse bush on No. 11 resulted in losing 1.30 strokes on approach.\n\nT2. Justin Rose, Daniel Brown (-5): Two English qualifiers are Lowry's closet competitors through 36 holes, and they couldn't be more different. A bogey on the par-5 4th could have been the beginning of the end for Brown, but he stood strong. Carding two birdies and two bogeys the rest of his way in, the first-time major participant heads into the weekend only two off the pace and as a member of the final pairing on Saturday. Brown could become the first player since Keegan Bradley at the 2011 PGA Championship to win in his first major.\n\nMeanwhile, the wily veteran Rose is the only player from the morning-afternoon wave to be under par midway through the championship; he did so in fabulous fashion clipping the scoring average by eight strokes Friday afternoon. Steady off the tee while impressive with his shot-making skills and iron play, Rose was a few lip outs away from inching even closer to the lead. He instead fired a 68 thanks to a long-distance connection on the last hole. The 44-year-old has made only one bogey all week.\n\n\"We're probably much more aligned than we are different in the sense of, go out there tomorrow, the mentality to do well is going to be to enjoy it, to be as free as you can with it, to give yourself the best opportunity to play well, to sort of embrace the fun part of it and the childhood dream part of it,\" Rose said. \"From that point of view, I think it's pretty similar.\"\n\nT4. Scottie Scheffler, Billy Horschel, Dean Burmester (-2): If it seems like he has not done anything extraordinary, it's because Scheffler actually has not. Carding back-to-back 70s, the world No. 1 is officially lurking for his third career major championship. He didn't hit the ball as well on Friday, but the putter more than made up for it highlighted by a 35-foot birdie on No. 14. \"Well, I would have liked to be leading, but it's just one of those deals,\" Scheffler said. \"I've played two solid rounds, and it put me five shots back, and I'll continue to try to execute and just continue to try to hit good shots and hit good putts out there.\"\n\nT7. Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay, Jason Day, Corey Conners (-1): Schauffele was able to effectively navigate Royal Troon on Friday even without his best stuff to keep him in this tournament. Alongside him was his good friend, Cantlay, who did find his quality in Round 2. Cantlay was one of six players to shoot 68 on Friday as he ranked fourth in strokes gained tee to green and was enough to position him in weekend contention for the second straight major championship.\n\n\"I played well at the U.S. Open, played well at Travelers,\" Cantlay said. \"I feel like my game is in a good spot. I think anytime you get into contention, play well, give yourself a chance, it kind of builds on itself and you can draw on those memories going forward in other big events.\"\n\nT11. Joaquin Niemann, Matthew Jordan (E): The Chilean pushed the early pace in the afternoon hours with a couple birdies in his first four holes. Giving one back, Niemann arrived at the par-3 8th in red figures. He left moments later 4 over for the championship after finding three different greenside bunkers and carding an eight. Niemann battled back with vigor with four birdies in his next 10 holes to give himself weekend hope.\n\nT13. Brooks Koepka, Collin Morikawa, Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, Mackenzie Hughes (+1): One bad swing was the difference between Koepka's second round being an under-par effort rather than over par like it was. Needing to take an unplayable on the par-5 6th, the five-time major champion carded a double bogey on one of the few front-nine scoring opportunities. He carded 12 straight pars from there to give himself an outside chance, albeit a lot will have to do with how Lowry plays from here on out.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news",

While the conditions in the morning bamboozled many of the world's top players, Lowry was steady throughout his round. He credited practice rounds on the course and extended time in Ireland and the UK over the past few weeks.\n\nI've been at home for the last three weeks ago. I came here two weeks ago for two days just to do a bit of preparation for this. It's just being here, getting a bit of feel, and trusting your instinct and doing what I did today, and hopefully that'll work for the rest of the week as well.\n\nLowry was inevitably asked about any similarities between today and his Open win along the Co. Antrim coast in 2019.\n\nLowry didn't shirk the question but said he tries not to dwell too much on that win.\n\nI'm trying not to think about it too much now. I holed a putt to go into the lead out there today and I thought it was the first time I'd lead The Open in five years.\n\nNo matter what I'll do, Portrush will always have a place in my heart. I love that place. I love this tournament.

Brown said, acknowledging his unlikely story. \"I was nervous on the first tee, obviously it being my first major. I was struggling to feel my legs a bit, but after that I got quite settled. I hit a few nice shots early, so I kind of got settled into the round pretty quick.\n\n\"I was playing well leading up to the tournament, so scores haven't really reflected it recently,'' Brown, whose brother Ben is caddying for him, continued. \"But I felt comfortable and probably a bit more calm than you normally would be with it being your first major.\n\n\"I know there's still 54 holes left. There's a long way to go.''\n\nJustin Thomas took the lead out of the early wave of tee times, shooting a 3-under 68.\n\nHe's followed by Alex Noren, Justin Rose, Russell Henley, Xander Schauffele, Mackenzie Hughes, Matthew Fitzpatrick, Joe Dean and Nicolai Hojgaard at 2-under.\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, Adam Scott, Brooks Koepka, Matt Wallace, Chris Kirk and Sepp Straka are all 1-under.\n\nAside from the handful of great scores, the day was mostly characterized by the world's best players being completely befuddled by the opposite winds at Troon, where the prevailing winds they practiced in all week reversed.\n\nThe result left a lot of bloated scores out there, like Rory McIlroy's 7-over 78, Bryson DeChambeau's 5-over 76, same for Tommy Fleetwood and Max Homa (76s).\n\nWyndham Clark and Rickie Fowler each shot 78. Cam Smith, the 2022 Open champion, shot 80.\n\n\"It's very difficult out there,'' Jon Rahm said after shooting 73. \"Eight out of those first nine holes, all of them are [wind] in off the right, playing long, difficult holes. Just when you think it might get a little easier downwind, it really isn't. The back nine has a lot of teeth, and those par-3s are very, very difficult.\n\n\"There's not an easy golf course out there. We were all suffering equally.''\n\nNot Brown and Lowry, who received a massive reception on his way up the 18th. It sounded more like weekend cheers for the leader than a Thursday.\n\nAfter the round, he tried to tell himself and anyone else who would listen that, as well as he played, it's only Thursday.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy, but it's only one day,'' Lowry said. \"We've got three more days. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\n\n\"The walk down 18 was actually pretty cool. It's the greatest walk in golf. I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house [at Portrush], and that's the plan ... to try to get to do that again. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days. I'd give anything to win this tournament again.

Meanwhile, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods faced a nightmare start, with McIlroy shooting a seven-over-par 78 and Woods struggling to a 79. McIlroy's round was derailed by double bogeys on the eighth and 11th holes, leaving him focused on just making the cut. Lowry, who won the British Open five years ago, birdied three of five holes around the turn and added another birdie on the 18th to lead by two shots.\n\nThe challenging weather conditions on Scotland's west coast took a toll on many top players. Justin Thomas, a two-time major winner, is close behind Lowry at three under par, while recent USPGA Championship winner Xander Schauffele is among a group at two under, which also includes Justin Rose. World number one Scottie Scheffler, despite struggling on the greens, finished one under par. McIlroy's hopes of ending a decade-long wait for a major title are now slim after a series of misfortunes, including an unlucky bunker incident on the eighth hole.\n\nIn stark contrast, Bryson DeChambeau, who has performed well in majors this year, found the windy links golf conditions tough, ending six over par for his opening nine holes. However, he made a comeback with an eagle on the 17th to finish with a 76. DeChambeau expressed pride in his perseverance, while Thomas praised his own solid play, recovering from a double bogey at the 12th to shoot a 68.

If I can keep holing putts I can be dangerous.\"\n\nAmerican Xander Schauffele, Swede Alex Noren, England's Justin Rose and Joe Dean, American Russell Henley, Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard and Canadian Mackenzie Hughes finished on two under with world number one Scottie Scheffler among a group a further shot back.\n\nSeveral big names struggled, however, in testing conditions on the Ayrshire coast, not least U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau who was six over after 11 holes before making eagle on the 16th to finish at five over.\n\nPOOR START\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy also endured a poor start to his bid for a fifth major title after carding a miserable 78.\n\nThomas, who has never had a top-10 finish at the Open and missed the cut last year, birdied the second, fourth and seventh as well as the Postage Stamp par-three eighth.\n\nA double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey at 13 stalled his progress but he holed a 17-foot par putt at the 15th and birdied the last two holes.\n\n\"I played so well today but gave a couple back at the beginning of the back nine,\" former world number one Thomas said.\n\n\"I'm playing really well and feeling confident about my game. It's nice to get off to a good start in a major.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's McIlroy bogeyed the first and dropped two shots at the Postage Stamp as his bunker escape rolled back into the cavernous sand trap.\n\nThings got worse when he bogeyed the 10th and he emerged with a double bogey at the 11th after hitting his tee shot out of bounds over the railway track skirting the course.\n\nDefending champion Brian Harman uncharacteristically endured an up-and-down front nine with two birdies and three bogeys before finishing on two over par.\n\nLarge galleries headed for home favourite Robert MacIntyre who was joined by Spain's Jon Rahm and England's Tommy Fleetwood.\n\nLast week's Scottish Open winner MacIntyre started solidly but undid an early birdie with a missed par putt at the fifth and finished on one over, one shot ahead of Rahm, as Fleetwood struggled to a round of 76.\n\nReporting by Ed Osmomd and Martyn Herman, Editing by Toby Davis and Ken Ferris\n\nOur Standards: The

But Rory McIlroy had a nightmare day shooting 78, seven over par, and will need a miracle round this afternoon to make it into the weekend.

It's not easy.\"\n\nWoods was not asked about the matter as he took only four questions after his round, but has spoken about his problems previously, revealing at the 2023 Masters he felt \"constant\" pain in his right leg.\n\nHe has also admitted seeking professional help to manage medication issues in the past.\n\n06:45 , Lawrence Ostlere\n\nA year after crashing out of the Open having made \"bonehead mistakes\", Justin Thomas is a lot happier with his game after shooting a three-under 68 to take an early lead at Royal Troon.\n\nMissing the cut by eight shots at Hoylake 12 months ago had the American worrying for his Ryder Cup place - although he would subsequently receive a captain's pick - as he was struggling to find any form.\n\nWhile things have picked up for him this year with five top-10 finishes, including eighth at last month's US Open, he failed to make the weekend at the Masters or US PGA.\n\nJustin Thomas heading in 'right direction' after impressive start to Open\n\nRahm has finished in the top 10 of all nine LIV events he has played since his shock move to the Saudi-funded breakaway, but his performances in this year's majors have been hugely disappointing.\n\nThe Ryder Cup star was 45th in the defence of his Masters title and missed the cut in the US PGA Championship before being forced to withdraw from the US Open - which he won in 2021 - due to a toe injury.\n\nPaul McGinley believes Jon Rahm is 'hoping for a deal' between PGA Tour and LIV\n\n06:25 , Mike Jones\n\nEngland's Matt Wallace carded the first eagle of the 152nd Open Championship to catapult himself into a share of the lead at Royal Troon on a testing first morning of unfamiliar winds and intermittent showers.\n\nThe 34-year-old had to come through final qualifying last year only to miss the cut at Hoylake but had no such worries this summer after finishing 20th on the DP World Tour rankings.\n\nHe had a brilliant start as, after a birdie at the second, he holed out from the semi-rough at the 612-yard fourth to leap to three under and into a share of the lead with American two-time major winner Justin Thomas, who himself missed the cut last year, after he birdied seven and eight.\n\nMatt Wallace cards first eagle of the 152nd Open to share lead early on day one\n\nA month after McIlroy's nightmare finish at Pinehurst helped DeChambeau claim a second US Open title, the pair were facing an uphill battle simply to make the cut in the year's final major at Royal Troon.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes of his opening round before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nRory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau at wrong end of Open leaderboard on day one\n\nRory McIlroy has been grouped with Tyrrell Hatton and Max Homa as he once more seeks a long-awaited return to winning ways at a major, while Brian Harman will begin the defence of his Open crown with Viktor Hovland and Sahith Theegala for company.\n\nScottie Scheffler features in an all-American three-ball with Jordan Spieth and Cameron Young.

As all eventual major winners tend to do, though, he leveraged what could have been the long unwinding of a great week and turned it into a second consecutive round in the 60s. At 7 under with the morning wave from the second round concluded, he holds the clubhouse lead at The Open.\n\nAfter a first-nine 34, Lowry looked well on his way to another great Open round to follow the 66 he shot late Thursday. However, the nasty 11th hole caused him all kind of problems (and it could have been even worse). After his tee shot next to the train tracks settled up the right side in the tall, wispy fescue, Lowry smother hooked his second into the left gorse. This led to some hollering at a camera operator who apparently affected his play. (Lowry later admitted he was just looking for somebody to blame.)\n\nA few moments after his second shot disappeared into the nasty gorse on the other side of the hole, Lowry dropped a ball in that same spot and belted what was then his fourth shot onto the green. He gave himself a putt at making bogey.\n\nIt all should have been so straightforward ... except someone found his original second shot deep in the gorse, and according to the rules, he had to play that ball instead of the provisional he had hit onto the green. The big problem? There was no way to play it. He had to take an unplayable on that original ball and drop what looked to be 30 or 40 yards back on line with the pin. From there, he was hitting his fourth, and he made a double-bogey 6.\n\nIf all of that sounds like a mess, well, yeah.\n\n\"I did the hard part,\" Lowry said. \"I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole. I did [have] a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\n\n\"Then from there, I hit a great provisional. The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said, 'No.' So I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there and somebody had found it. So, apparently, we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it. Which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes, it was whatever it was, of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing. And I felt like [my caddie] did a great job, too, just kind of -- he kept telling me [that] we have loads of time. 'We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.'\"\n\nIt took Lowry approximately 30 minutes to play that 11th hole -- 20 minutes elapsed between his second shot and his third -- and everything seemed heightened in the moment because, you know, he was leading The Open at the time all of it was taking place.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nSituations like these can affect players mentally and emotionally even more than it does their scorecards. In Lowry's case, he was able to persevere. He proceeded to hit some filthy flighted irons the whole way home and regained both strokes on two more birdies coming in with an exclamation point at the last.\n\n\"Sometimes, you are in a frame of mind that it works better ... you know, you get on with it better than other times,\" Lowry explained \"This week in my head feels like that where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there. Almost ready for ... anything that's thrown at me. I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\"\n\nIf Lowry's lead holds as the rest of the field plays in windy conditions this afternoon, it will be his second 36-hole lead at a major. The last came at the 2019 Open Championship when he ultimately hoisted the Claret Jug. If he captures another, he will be the first player who already has already won an Open to capture a second jug since Ernie Els in 2012.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle Porter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festuca", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Festuca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Els", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ernie Els"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke play"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/19/f6ea9f06-f9fb-4928-a75b-1367ed571e8e/thumbnail/1200x675/f23f3cd51bc086a5a6d313dab3cace98/shane-lowry-open-r2-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Lowry declared his ball lost before hitting a superb shot to inside 10 feet of the cup.\n\nAt that point, however, his original ball was located and, according to the Rules of Golf, his second ball on the green was no longer in play. Lowry took an unplayable lie, struck his fourth shot to just short of the green and two-putted.\n\n\"Through that whole process of 20 minutes ... of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop ...

Just get out of the way. Just get back there. F*** sake.\"\n\nAfter this unfortunate second shot, the 37-year-old had swiftly opted to take a penalty drop and take his fourth shot onto the green.\n\nBut he was forced to backtrack when a spectator eventually found his original ball among the bushes.\n\nWith the ball therefore deemed to be still in play, Lowry instead took a drop after a lengthy pause - although his fourth shot this time did not quite reach the green.\n\nAnd even a bogey was to prove unattainable, as he put the ball just past the cup with his fifth shot, forcing him to settle for a double bogey which erased his solo lead completely.\n\nHe and Brown then shared the lead at five-under at that point.\n\nHowever, the Irishman went on to make a remarkable recovery from that point onwards, securing two birdies on the 16th and the 18th holes to restore his score to seven under.\n\nHe finished the course on the second day with a comfortable lead as he prepares for the weekend's action.\n\nAs Lowry told reporters after his impressive first day, the real trick would be to keep up his momentum across the rest of the tournament.\n\nHe said on Thursday evening: \"It's great, but there's three rounds left.\n\n\"If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today.

According to the radio broadcast, Lowry blamed a photographer for the bad shot from a perfect lie. Lowry knew immediately that he was in a world of trouble and declared the ball lost to the rules official walking with his group, intending to take a penalty, and dropped another ball. He hit a beauty to inside 10 feet and it looked like he might escape without too much pain.\n\nHowever, a spectator found Lowry's ball in the gorse bush, which meant that Lowry had no choice but to play his original ball. Lowry argued with the rules official. According to the radio reporter, he said, \"Even though I told you I didn't want to search for it.\" The rules official said, \"I am very sorry, but yes.\"\n\nAccording to the Rules of Golf, as soon as the ball is found it is back in play and the second ball on the green is no longer an option to play.\n\n\"It's one of those rules where common sense is thrown out,\" said radio commentator Brendon de Jonge.\n\nLowry asked for a second opinion but the ruling stood. He elected to take an unplayable lie. He could've dropped within two club lengths but it wouldn't have given him much of a shot so instead took the option of taking the ball back on line of sight into the 12th fairway. After the penalty shot, he knocked his fourth to the fringe and took two putts for a double-bogey 6. Lowry led the championship by two when he teed off at No. 11, Railway, but after his Railway nightmare, he left tied for the lead with Englishman Daniel Brown.\n\n\"Is this really going to mess with the mind of Shane Lowry?\" the radio host asked.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_schupak@golfweek.usatoday.com", "name": "Adam Schupak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendon_de_Jonge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendon de Jonge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rules of golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Coaching_and_Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Coaching and Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://golfweek.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2024/07/GettyImages-2162652968.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

If I can keep holing putts I can be dangerous.\"\n\nAmerican Xander Schauffele, Swede Alex Noren, England's Justin Rose and Joe Dean, American Russell Henley, Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard and Canadian Mackenzie Hughes finished on two-under with world number one Scottie Scheffler among a group a further shot back.\n\nSeveral big names struggled, however, in testing conditions on the Ayrshire coast, not least US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau who was six over after 11 holes before making eagle on the 16th to finish at five over.\n\nWorld number two Rory McIlroy also endured a poor start to his bid for a fifth major title after carding a miserable 78.\n\nThomas, who has never had a top-10 finish at the Open and missed the cut last year, birdied the second, fourth and seventh as well as the Postage Stamp par-three eighth.\n\nA double-bogey six at the 12th and a bogey at 13 stalled his progress but he holed a 17-foot par putt at the 15th and birdied the last two holes.\n\n\"I played so well today but gave a couple back at the beginning of the back nine,\" former world number one Thomas said.\n\n\"I'm playing really well and feeling confident about my game. It's nice to get off to a good start in a major.\"\n\nNorthern Ireland's McIlroy bogeyed the first and dropped two shots at the Postage Stamp as his bunker escape rolled back into the cavernous sand trap.\n\nThings got worse when he bogeyed the 10th and he emerged with a double bogey at the 11th after hitting his tee shot out of bounds over the railway track skirting the course.\n\nDefending champion Brian Harman uncharacteristically endured an up-and-down front nine with two birdies and three bogeys before finishing on two over par.\n\nLarge galleries headed for home favourite Robert MacIntyre who was joined by Spain's Jon Rahm and England's Tommy Fleetwood.\n\nLast week's Scottish Open winner MacIntyre started solidly but undid an early birdie with a missed par putt at the fifth and finished on one over, one shot ahead of Rahm, as Fleetwood struggled to a round of 76.\n\nTiger Woods had little good to say about his disastrous eight-over-par first round as the course took a toll on the three-times winner.\n\nThe American recorded six bogeys, two double bogeys and a two birdies in a round of 79 and admitted his lack of playing time may have impacted his performance.\n\n\"As the year has gone on, I have gotten better. I just wish I could have played a little bit more, but I've been saving it for the majors,\" said Woods, who has kept a limited schedule after a 2021 car crash.\n\n\"Hopefully, next year will be a little bit better than this year.\"\n\nWoods made a good start as he drained a long birdie putt on the par-four third to wild cheers from the crowd.\n\nThe round quickly unravelled, however, as the 15-times major champion bogeyed the par-five fourth and landed in the bunker en route to a double bogey at the fifth before two more bogeys on the front nine.\n\nA single birdie on the back nine did little to help as Woods landed in the bushes to double bogey the sixth and bogeyed the 12th before finishing with two more bogeys.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today. I made that putt on the third hole, and then I think I had, what, three 3-putts today. I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today,\" Woods told reporters.\n\n\"I need to shoot something in the mid-60s tomorrow to get something going on the weekend.\"\n\nThe 48-year-old said this week he would continue playing for as long as he believes he is able to win.\n\n\"I thought I could play a little bit more earlier in the year. I was a little bit too optimistic. I need to do a lot more work in the gym and keep progressing like we have,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I kept telling myself that out there because for some reason I felt like the crowd were getting very excited ... it felt more like the weekend.\n\n\"I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nWhere some top names were close to being blown out of contention by the whipping winds at the seaside course, Lowry said his familiarity with the layout helped him tame it.\n\n\"Fortunately enough I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day.

If you're not striking the ball good, you're not going to be in control of your ball,\" he said.\n\nLowry's hot putting led to five birdies and he said he was adjusting to the speed of the European greens faster than normal after a long stretch in the U.S. on the PGA Tour.\n\n\"My speed control was very good, and I saw my lines great,\" he said. \"It feel like links greens when you start to see your lines, the hole feels quite big, so it felt like that today, and long may it continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--BpP-yywK--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/one-cms/core/2024-07-18t215110z_1_lynxmpek6h0yg_rtroptp_3_golf-open.jpg?itok=Zd3GjZHi", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

battle to make cut", "body": "Shane Lowry moved back into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par midway through his second round as Tiger Woods looks set to miss the cut at Royal Troon on Friday.\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, picked up birdies on the first, fifth and eighth to make the turn with a two-shot lead.\n\nBrown, the world number 272, remains Lowry's closest challenger but dropped back to five under after five.\n\nWoods was adamant earlier in the week that he is not considering retirement and feels physically better than 12 months ago.\n\nBut the 15-time major champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links, dropping three shots on the front nine to slide to 11 over par for the tournament.\n\nWith the projected cut at four over, Woods, 48, seems certain to fail to complete four rounds for the sixth time in eight majors since a car accident in 2021 left him with severe leg injuries.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nWorld number three Xander Schauffele recovered from a difficult start to make the turn at two under.\n\nThe recently crowned USPGA Championship winner had dropped back to even par before back-to-back biridies at the seventh and eighth.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler is also lurking at one under after a level par front nine.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nTwo-time major winner Justin Thomas is well poised to make a push for the final group on Saturday as he starts at three under.\n\nkca/jc", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He then yells at cameraman, and 20-minute ruling needed", "body": "Shane Lowry on Friday to the left of the 11th hole at Royal Troon.\n\nGetty Images\n\nShane Lowry hit, then, in order: He yelled at a cameraman. He hit again. He talked with an official. He heard what he didn't want to hear. He calculated.\n\nYou looked at your clock. Twenty-plus minutes in all until he hit again.\n\nWhen the sequence was finished on Friday, Lowry had lost his lead during the Open Championship's second round. But what preceded it on Royal Troon's 11th hole was as gnarly as the fescue grass he hit into to the right of the fairway, kicking things off.\n\nTo that point, Lowry was two-under for his round and leading by a pair, but he was now in trouble. Seconds earlier, playing partner Matt Fitzpatrick had hit a shank from a similar lie from the left side of the fairway. Lowry then followed with his own. His iron rocketed his ball left, over the gallery, deep into a gorse bush.\n\nWhat happened there? Thick grass? Nerves? Three seconds after contact, Lowry whipped his head to the right.\n\nHe'd heard a cameraman. TV mics picked up this from him:\n\n\"As I was over the ball, I could just see you putting your f**king camera up. Just get out of the way. Just get back there. F**k's sake.\"\n\nRules issues followed.\n\nLowry hit a provisional. It finished about 8 feet past the hole. He'd take that. But he couldn't. Someone had found his first ball. You can imagine the words here. Rule 18.3c (3) says this: \"When a provisional ball has not yet become the ball in play, it must be abandoned ... when original ball is found on course outside penalty area before the end of the three minute search time. The player must play the original ball as it lies.\"\n\nSo Lowry did. But the ball was deep in the cabbage.\n\nSaid an announcer on USA Network's coverage: \"It is looking rather somber in there, doesn't it?\"\n\nWhat to do? Lowry opted to take an unplayable. But where would he drop? The process started. He eventually worked his way to his left and backward, just to the left of the adjacent 12th fairway. Figuring out a yardage was a challenge. Lowry looked. His caddie, Darren Reynolds, looked.\n\nSaid analyst Smylie Kaufman on the broadcast: \"It has been pretty insane the last 10, 15 minutes because they're holding the whole course up and Shane's trying to figure out the right decision.\"\n\nSaid analyst Paul McGinley: \"Smylie, what is he going to do now to get a yardage? How is the caddie going to get yardage? This is a completely different angle.\"\n\nSaid Kaufman: \"It's all feel. I mean, really, there's no way to know exactly what the yardage is. It's only about 115 yards to the hole location where he is right now, just looking at it from my perspective. He only really needs to land it about 80, 90 yards. But just looking at his lie, it's not going to be an issue. There's no way he can see where the flag stick is. And for Shane right here, it's going to be all feel, trusting the shot.\"\n\nAt this point, the broadcast showed that just over 20 minutes had elapsed since Lowry's second stroke.\n\nHe eventually settled in. He hit his fourth stroke. It finished about 30 feet away. From there, he took two putts, finished with a double-bogey 6 and dropped into a share of the lead.\n\n\"Slightly derailed here on the railway hole here on 11,\" McGinley said on the broadcast.\n\nLowry rallied, though. He birdied 16 and 18. He exited with a two-shot advantage. Afterward, he seemingly knew a question would come.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nHe admitted the cameraman's distraction. Lowry had asked him to move back, but he didn't. He said he saw the camera standing over the ball. He said he lost his train of thought. He said the fear of going right with his second shot led to him going left.\n\nWalking up to his provisional, Lowry said an official asked him if he wanted to look for his ball. He said no. Too late.\n\n\"So I assumed that was OK,\" Lowry said. \"Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes, it was whatever it was, of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing, and I felt like Darren did a great job, too, just kind of -- he kept telling me, we have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It was not like -- it wasn't a disaster.

Despite that, he managed a six-foot putt for birdie for a share of the lead on the opening hole.\n\nHe had birdie chances at all four of the opening holes, with varying degrees of difficulty. At the second, he was left a putt from 30ft, this time after slightly overshooting the flag. He two-putted that to stay six-under par.\n\nHe looked in a strong position to take the outright lead at the next hole but, having looked unstoppable with the putter on day one, he was just off line from about eight feet.\n\nUnflustered, he made amends with a birdie on four to go seven-under and one clear.\n\nLooking ahead to the rest of the tournament, Lowry, who won five years ago at Portrush, said after his first round at Royal Troon: \"There's three rounds left. If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'm fully aware that I have a job to do over the next three days. I'd give anything to win this tournament again. I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week. This is obviously a great start to do that.\n\n\"It's hard to get to the front. When you do get to the front, you kind of have to keep going and keep your foot down and see where it leaves you at the weekend.\"\n\nGermany's Marcel Siem had been the form man on course early on, enjoying a storming start to his round with five birdies in his opening eight holes before double-bogeying the ninth and picking up three more bogeys with four still to play as the back nine reared its ugly head, as it had for many others yesterday.\n\nAnother former Open champion, Darren Clarke, rolled back the years after his opening-day 77 and picked up three shots in his opening five holes. Meanwhile, Tiger Woods had a double-bogey on the second to move into double figures over par.\n\nThe forecast was for a dry day, but with windy conditions expected to wreak havoc at points, as it had done yesterday, and reaching its peak in the early afternoon.\n\nMcIlroy, among the later starters on the course for round two, was hoping for a better showing after a difficult opening day. In round one, the four-time Major champion recorded a solitary birdie and his round fell apart from the eighth, where he dropped five shots in four holes, including double-bogeys on the eighth and 11th.\n\nHe finished his round with a bogey on 18, having also dropped another shot on 15, to end the day on seven-over par and struggling to avoid the cut.\n\nLooking ahead to the weekend, he said: \"I just [need to] come out and try to play better and be here for the weekend. The conditions look like they're going to be pretty similar again.\n\n\"I have to do a better job in those conditions and I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under-par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more and feel like I have half a chance.\"\n\nLooking back on a difficult day one, he said: \"I felt like I did okay for the first part of the round. I was actually surprised how difficult the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did. The course was playing tough.

DeChambeau, the reigning U.S. Open champion, shot 42 for his first nine holes and finished with a 76. McIlroy had two double bogeys -- including a tee shot onto the nearby railway line -- and shot 78.\n\nThe two top combatants at last month's U.S. Open were all but out of the tournament by lunchtime.\n\nMeanwhile, for much of the day, Justin Thomas's early score of 3-under-par 69 stood atop the leaderboard, with 2019 Open champion Shane Lowry surpassing him late with an excellent five-birdie, no-bogey 66 followed by a 65 from unheralded Daniel Brown, an Englishman who made it through final qualifying two weeks ago.\n\nFor Lowry, it looked easy. It always does when you hit it in the fairway and make up for mistakes with a sharp short game.\n\nBut Troon changed from what the players got used to in practice and that caused a bit of consternation.\n\n\"It did change a lot because we played the front nine down and the back nine into the wind in all our practice rounds,\" Lowry said. \"But fortunately enough I came here two weeks ago and I played this wind on the second day that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible I could see it.\n\n\"I guess that was a good thing to do, and it's out there paying off a little bit today.\"\n\nPerhaps. Then again, this is the Open, and major championship that depends on weather more than any other.\n\n\"That's what you kind of get,\" said Jason Day, who shot 73. \"The first part of the week was eCommerce for Scotland. It was unbelievable. It was perfect weather, sunny. I was starting to get a tan. That's not what you really expect when you come over to Scotland.\n\n\"I think it was fun today. Obviously that's kind of what you expect when you come to an Open Championship.\"\n\nAll of which makes some of the befuddlement somewhat surprising. Yes, it was a different ballpark during the first round, the dimensions considerably more confusing.\n\nBut this is part of preparing for links golf.\n\n\"Even when it's downwind in the practice rounds, you're thinking about where you will play from and what shots you will hit if the wind is from a different direction,\" said Phil Mickelson, who won the 2013 Open at Muirfield and finished second to Henrik Stenson here in 2016 -- when the winning score was 20 under par. \"That was the problem for me. I just hit some bad shots.\"\n\nMickelson, 54, birdied the last hole to shoot 73, which was better than the likes of Ludvig Aberg, Hideki Matsuyama, Max Homa, DeChambeau and McIlroy, who was one better than Tiger Woods, who had a 79.\n\nMcIlroy noted the problems despite a forecast that suggested it could be just what the players faced.\n\n\"I've come in here playing really well. I played really well at the Renaissance last week,\" McIlroy said, noting his tie for fourth at the Genesis Scottish Open. \"I think if anything, the conditions got the better of me, those cross-winds. Then once we turned on that back nine, it was a left-to-right wind. I was sort of struggling to hole the ball in that wind a little bit, and that got me.\"\n\nDeChambeau expressed similar sentiments.\n\n\"It's a completely different test,\" he said. \"I didn't get any practice in it, and I didn't really play much in the rain. It's a difficult test out here. Something I'm not familiar with.\"\n\nFor all the angst, there are 17 players under par and within five shots of Brown's lead, including No. 1-ranked Scottie Scheffler, who shot 70 along with five-time major champion Brooks Koepka.\n\nAnother windy day awaits Friday, with the strongest gusts forecast for the afternoon. But that forecast can change, too.\n\nWhen playing links golf along the Scottish coast, it's best to expect the unexpected.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Homa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Homa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsuyama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsuyama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Stenson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henrik Stenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5616,h_3159,x_0,y_117/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j33tf9xecjvcpy36rh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

In short, he will have to row this Friday to give himself some option for the weekend. And don't let him get lost, he's not far from the cut. Thomas, with two final birdies (on 17 and 18) after playing a first round in which he reached -4 after the 11th hole, was the leader for a good part of the Open, played in its first hours with cool, rain and wind.\n\nThomas is playing his eighth British with a tied 11th (2019) best result. \"I feel like everything has been going the right way, and I've been working in the right direction,\" said Thomas, who hasn't won since the 2022 PGA Championship.\n\n\"That's how this sport works sometimes. But I know I'm close to what I'm looking for and I'm not going to play for the results but for my game, which will then take care of itself,\" said Thomas. With 69 strokes, now sharing third place, several players finished: the Englishman Justin Rose, one of the Danish Hojgaard twins, Nicolai, the American Russell Henley and the Swede Alex Noren.\n\nIn the afternoon he was joined by current PGA champion Xander Schauffele. The truth is that at this start of British there were plenty of bogeys (and higher results) for everyone, to a greater or lesser extent. Among the victims, two of the candidates for the Jug, the Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy (double bogey on the 8th hole with very bad luck in the bounce of the ball, out of bounds on the 11th for another 'double' and bogey to row in the 18th), 78 (+7) and the winner a month ago of the US Open Bryson DeChambeau, with a final 76 (+5) thanks to an eagle on the 16th hole.", "source": {"uri":

On a boisterous, bewildering day of blustery buffetings on the lively Ayrshire coast, Lowry battled his way into a fortified position of authority with an eventful two-under 69 which hoisted him on to a seven-under aggregate and left him two shots clear of the English duo, Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, at the halfway stage.\n\nIt was quite a second round of action in this neck of the golfing woods. The wind whipped up to such an extent, even the Beaufort Scale itself was rent asunder.\n\nSome of the scores that were scribbled down on cards, meanwhile, could've been accompanied by a storm-force warning on the Shipping Forecast.\n\nSpare a thought for poor old Aguri Iwasaki from Japan, who had a brace of eye-watering nines at the 13th and 14th on his way to a torrid 91 that was strewn with various other splatterings of debris.\n\nYou could say his inward half of 52 was a solid run of scoring that was sullied by four pars. It's an unforgiving business, this links golf lark.\n\nPlenty would suffer. Rory McIlroy waved goodbye to another major year as he missed the cut by a country mile on 11-over. Tiger Woods slinked away on 14-over while the likes of Bryson DeChambeau, Cam Smith and Ludvig Aberg joined a high-profile casualty list. Royal Troon had caused more carnage than the global IT outage.\n\nLowry may have assumed command as he continues to hunt down his second Claret Jug but the 2019 champion certainly didn't have it all his own way.\n\nJollying along at two-under after 10 holes, things began to veer off track at the treacherous 11th. Known as Railway, this magnificently exacting par-4 can generate more cursing, muttering anguish than a reduced ScotRail timetable.\n\nA good drive found a decent lie in the rough but as he was about to clatter his second shot, he got distracted by the movements of a nearby cameraman.\n\nThe result? His ball fizzed off into a gorse bush and Lowry hissed a few expletives in the direction of said cameraman. We don't need to print them here.\n\nAfter gazing to the heavens in exasperation and taking a long, deep breath to compose himself, Lowry took a penalty drop and smacked his fourth shot to inside 10 feet to give himself a chance of salvaging a bogey.\n\nUnfortunately for Lowry, a spectator rummaging about in the bushes found his original ball.\n\nThat meant it was still in play and, after taking a drop following a lengthy ruling, Lowry hit another approach just short of the green and eventually completed a double-bogey six. It was quite a palaver.\n\nLowry rallied, though, and a birdie on the 16th provided the catalyst for a late flurry and the Ryder Cup man rolled in a 20-footer for another birdie on the 18th to finish with a flourish. In the end, there was no damage done.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six, it wasn't a disaster,\" admitted Lowry. \"I have felt quite calm and composed the last couple of days. I've felt really in my comfort zone.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times. Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on.\"\n\nBehind Lowry, Open debutant Brown kept himself in the thick of it with a 72 for his five-under total. \"I prefer being called Dan,\" the 29-year-old informed the media. \"Daniel is usually when I'm getting told off by my mum and dad.\"\n\nWhen he came in at 9:35pm on Thursday night with the outright lead, Brown was being called a few other things by the cheesed off golf scribblers. That he maintained his lofty position on the order yesterday attracted praise, not profanities.\n\n\"I'm a bit of a realist,\" he added. \"I'm not going to start getting ahead of myself and think, 'oh my God, I'm second in the Open'. There are still 36-holes left.\"\n\nLike Brown, Rose is looking to become the first Englishman to lift the Claret Jug in 32 years and a steely 68 left him lurking with intent.\n\nThe former US Open champion had to go through the pre-qualifying rigmarole for this week's showpiece and he's making the most of his opportunity. A canny, composed Rose has made just one bogey in 36-holes. So far, so good.\n\n\"Round one was plain sailing, with 16 greens (hit) and lot of tap-in pars,\" he said. \"What was good about it today was that I had to grind. It was the perfect mix. Playing well and fighting well.\"\n\nBilly Horschel matched Rose's 68 to share fourth on two-under with Dean Burmester. The presence of the world No1, Scottie Scheffler, on that same mark was an ominous sign.\n\nXander Schauffele and Jason Day are hovering on one-under while major winners Dustin Johnson, Brooks Koepka, Collin Morikawa and Jon Rahm are all in the mix at one-over.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cam Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScotRail", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ScotRail"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18331532/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

"Lowry takes British Open lead, Woods, McIlroy battle to make cut", "body": "Shane Lowry moved back into the lead of the 152nd British Open at seven under par midway through his second round as Tiger Woods looks set to miss the cut at Royal Troon on Friday.\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, picked up birdies on the first, fifth and eighth to make the turn with a two-shot lead.\n\nBrown, the world number 272, remains Lowry's closest challenger but dropped back to five under after five.\n\nWoods was adamant earlier in the week that he is not considering retirement and feels physically better than 12 months ago.\n\nBut the 15-time major champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links, dropping three shots on the front nine to slide to 11 over par for the tournament.\n\nWith the projected cut at four over, Woods, 48, seems certain to fail to complete four rounds for the sixth time in eight majors since a car accident in 2021 left him with severe leg injuries.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nMore from this section WI: 2024 Republican National Convention - Day 4 - 54636000 Couple lie side-by-side and hold hands for last time before dying Winnipeg gets its first Free Blockbuster\n\nWorld number three Xander Schauffele recovered from a difficult start to make the turn at two under.\n\nThe recently crowned USPGA Championship winner had dropped back to even par before back-to-back biridies at the seventh and eighth.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler is also lurking at one under after a level par front nine.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nTwo-time major winner Justin Thomas is well poised to make a push for the final group on Saturday as he starts at three under.\n\nkca/jc", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro

Now he's leading The Open", "body": "TROON, Scotland -- We've spent the last week-and-a-half listening to pros talk about golf in a different way. The turf being firm, the wind being heavy, the bunkers being pots -- links golf takes something different, so they work at being different.\n\nMost use last week's Scottish Open as the perfect warmup. They arrive in Edinburgh a bit bleary-eyed, hail a shuttle out to Renaissance Club -- a ritzy, modern course -- and grind the sharp edges out of their wedges. They practice weird shots from the fescue, splashes from the lips of bunkers, and stingers with all types of clubs. They all do it in sync, too, like students prepping for the same exam. That must be the right approach, you think. Well, maybe they should be following the Shane Lowry line.\n\nLowry, our 37-year-old Open Championship leader, has been grooving his links game for weeks, just like everyone else. But he was doing it elsewhere. Notably, he was doing it here, on a bit of recce.\n\nThat's the slang he used Friday, common in this part of the world, short for reconnaissance.\n\nLowry -- and last week's Scottish Open champ, Bob MacIntyre -- left America weeks ago and visited Royal Troon in early July. Mother Nature repaid them for their commitment, offering up \"mental\" conditions, according to one member of Team Lowry. Over two days, Lowry claimed to see the course 'course 'in every wind possible.\" Most of the field grumbled about not prepping for the abnormal conditions that arrived in round 1. Lowry pulled his hat down and shot 66.\n\nThat comes with doing your homework. Tiger Woods didn't do his. The LIV guys were in the south of Spain, where people go for honeymoons. Wyndham Clark's final round 62 at Renaissance turned into a 78-80 performance here on the other side of the country.\n\nLowry enjoyed his recce so much that he sent out what now seems like a warning on Instagram, a video of him going driver, 3-iron on the 18th hole with wind and rain whipping into his mug. \"Bad day for shorts,\" said the caption, even though he was wearing some. What he didn't tell you -- as the person holding the camera said \"yeah, what a flight\" -- was that driver, 3-iron ended up short of the green.\n\nFrom Troon, Lowry went home, to Ireland -- a trip he doesn't get to make much these days. But similar to MacIntyre, home can feel extra special after a long, grinding season in America.\n\n\"I always really enjoy my week in Ireland the week before The Open,\" Lowry said, \"and I go around and play some links golf and hang out with my friends. I really feel like that puts me in a good frame of mind going into play a big tournament.\"\n\nHe mentioned that twice Friday afternoon. Frame of mind.\n\n\"This week in my head feels like that -- where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there. Almost ready for -- anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on.\"\n\nMore than wedge grinds and low shots and avoiding bunkers, that is what links golf sounds like. Take what's given to you. The idea was never clearer Friday afternoon, when Lowry turned back downwind for the finishing stretch, holding a two-shot lead. He left his 11th tee shot out to the right, in the fescue, and allowed his mind to stray, for the slightest moment, to a cameraman kneeling up the rope line.\n\nA few seconds later, Lowry sent his ball hooking left. It flew a little more than 100 yards, skimming low over spectators heads and landing so softly into the gorse bush behind them that most didn't even notice. Lowry let out a proper, Irish-accented four-letter F-word, then berated the nearby cameraman for moving within his eyesight while he was over the ball.\n\nCould he have paused his process to regain focus? That's a regret he'll stew on tonight as he enjoys the lead all to himself. Friday's 69 could have been a 67. But what followed was a formulaic, almost distractingly patient procedure. A provisional, a found ball, stepping off a yardage to the next fairway over, a drop in the rough, then stepping off a new yardage. Finally -- with Scottie Scheffler stretching back in the fairway to stay warm -- a careful swing short of the green and an up-and-down 6.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes -- whatever it was -- of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing, and I felt like Darren did a great job, too -- he kept telling me, we have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\"\n\nHe followed that mess by playing driver, then a 4-iron to 32 feet on the 12th. \"Two of the best shots I've hit all week,\" he said later. It kick-started a two-under bounce-back that pushed him to a comfy, solo lead, and something he had back in 2019 when he won the Open: a super late tee time. A 5-hour midterm that comes after breakfast, lunch, and an afternoon snack. Another test of patience. The first of a bunch this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bunker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wedge (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festuca", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Festuca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mill_(grinding)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mill (grinding)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/lowry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Then, he gave back a shot on the 17th and dropped to 6-over and was tied 71st with one more hole to come. With 70 and ties making the cut, Sharma was still in with a chance.\n\nAs Sharma was fighting hard to stay on for the weekend, Shane Lowry moved into pole position for a second Open title, after having won his first five years ago at home in Portrush.\n\nLowry (66-69) was 7-under and two shots clear of two Englishmen Justin Rose (69-68) and little-known Dan Brown (65-72).\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler (70-70) was lurking around in tied fourth alongside fellow American Billy Horschel (72-68) and South African Dean Burmester (71-69) at 2-under 140 for 36 holes.\n\nMeanwhile, a bunch of bigwigs and legends made an early exit as they were swept aside by the southerly wind across the Firth of Clyde at the Royal Troon.\n\nTiger Woods said he would be back at Portrush, but will not play again this year till his own Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas and the PNC Father-Son tournament.\n\nWoods shot 79-77 and was 14-over but smiled and said, \"I'd like to have played more, but I just wanted to make sure that I was able to play the major championships this year. I got a lot of time off to get better, to be better physically, which has been the case all year.\n\n\"I've gotten better, even though my results really haven't shown it, but physically I've gotten better, which is great. I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again.\" As for playing Majors and coming back for them, he said, \"No, I loved it. I've always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors.\n\n\"Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn't as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high.\" On returning to Portrush for the 2025 Open, he added, \"Yeah, definitely. Okay, sorry. That's a year away.\" Meanwhile, Indian-Americans Akshay Bhatia and Sahith Theegala were headed home early.\n\nBhatia (76-73) at 7-over was headed home while Theegala, who was 6-over for first round, was 5-over through the front nine.\n\nAaron Rai, the Englishman with a touch of India in him, shot 73 in the first round and was 3-over through 14 in the second to be 5-over.\n\nLowry, whose sole PGA Tour win this season came in the company of McIlroy, led the field as he gunned for a second Open win. He followed up an opening round of 66 with a 69 and was 7-under 135. He held a two-shot lead over Brown and Rose (69-68).\n\nThe 2019 Open winner Lowry had five bogeys against a bogey and a double bogey on the 'infamous' 11th hole, also called 'Railway'. He fought back with birdies on the 16th and the 18th.

Scott Heppell/Associated Press\n\nTROON, Scotland -- So much for the British Open being one last stand for Rory McIlroy in the majors this year. His best hope now is getting beyond one more day.\n\nAnd he has company from U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau and three-time Open champion Tiger Woods.\n\nThe protagonists from Pinehurst No. 2 were no match for a wind that came out of the opposite direction at Royal Troon and caused all three players more problems than they wanted Thursday.\n\nMcIlroy took two shots to get out of a deep bunker right of the \"Postage Stamp,\" the famous nickname of the 123-yard eighth hole. Three holes later, he hammered a drive that sailed over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds.\n\nIt added to a 7-over 78, his worst start to a major in five years.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeChambeau wasn't much better. He couldn't buy a par putt early on, even missing from 3 feet on the par-5 fourth. He tried to hit 7-iron out of the thick grass and moved the ball only a few feet, leading to a double bogey on the par-5 seventh.\n\nHe wound up with a 76 and was headed to the range to figure out his equipment and why his golf ball didn't leave the club the way he expected.\n\n\"It was a weird day,\" he said.\n\nWoods, a 15-time major champion, closed with back-to-back bogeys for a 79 that left him in danger of missing the cut for a third straight time at the Open.\n\n\"I didn't do a whole lot of things right today,\" he said. \"I need to shoot something in the mid-60s tomorrow to get something going on the weekend.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau lines up a putt on the third hole during his opening round of the British Open in Troon, Scotland, on Thursday. Jon Super/Associated Press\n\nThey were part of the morning wave and the star attraction coming off a U.S. Open that neither is likely to forget. McIlroy had a two-shot lead on the back nine and was still in control of his fate until missing a 30-inch par putt on the 16th hole, and then a par putt from just inside 4 feet on the 18th hole that extended his decade-long drought in the majors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDeChambeau captured his second U.S. Open by getting up-and-down from 55 yards away in a bunker on 18. The finish was so hard for McIlroy that he bolted from Pinehurst No. 2 without speaking or sticking around to congratulate DeChambeau.\n\nMcIlroy played last week in the Scottish Open and tied for fourth, and was optimistic about his form going into the final major of the year. But he and everyone else was thrown off their plans when the wind came from an opposite direction.\n\nIt was into their faces on the shorter front nine - where good scores are to be had - and helping from the left on the longer back nine, which isn't easy in any conditions.\n\n\"I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did,\" McIlroy said. \"The course was playing tough. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\"\n\nMcIlroy said he had a strategy based on the wind from the practice rounds.\n\n\"But then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice,\" he said. \"Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe round didn't end well. McIlroy chose to hit driver off the 18th and found a pot bunker to the left that left him no choice but to blast out sideways. He hit wedge to about 8 feet and missed one last putt, making one last bogey.\n\n\"I have to do a better job in those conditions, and I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more more and feel like I have half a chance,\" he said.\n\nMcIlroy was 10 shots out of the lead when he finished, but 13 shots back by the end of the day.\n\nDeChambeau's trouble was more of a slow bleed, going out in 42 and not registering a hole under par until he reached the par-5 16th. That was the one happy spot of the day. He easily reached the green on the 565-yard hole and made a 55-foot eagle putt.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" DeChambeau said. \"Shoot, man, I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home.' But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\n\n\"If I have some putts go in and hit some shots the way I know how to and figure out this equipment stuff, I'll be good.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWoods now has 14 consecutive rounds in the majors without breaking par, dating to a 69 in the second round of the 2022 PGA Championship. This was his highest score to start a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nHis average score in the majors this year is 75.4.\n\nA 79 was also his highest score in the opening round of a British Open. This is his 23rd appearance, dating back to 1995 at St. Andrews, and he's won it three times (2000, '05 and '06).\n\nThere were flashes early, but mostly disappointment for the 48-year-old Woods and his loyal fans.\n\nWoods got the crowd going when he curled in a 36-foot birdie putt at the par-4 third. He bogeyed the next hole, though, and double-bogeyed the par-3 fifth - forced to play backward out of a bunker - and he was 2 over.\n\n\"I made that putt on the third hole, and then I think I had, what, three three-putts today,\" he said. \"I didn't hit my irons very close, and I didn't give myself a whole lot of looks today.\"\n\nAfter he bogeyed the seventh, he got a shot in the arm from supportive fans as he ascended the walkway to the infamous \"Postage Stamp\" eighth - a 123-yard par 3. He missed the green, though, and after a promising chip, he two-putted for another bogey.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nNine Red Sox predictions: Trade deadline, playoffs, Alex Cora's future Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "sunjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lewiston Sun Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chambers_Bay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chambers Bay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iron (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/07/AP24200529657550.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years'.\n\n\"No matter what I do that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nA downbeat Rory McIlroy had earlier dismissed his chances of mounting a challenge for a fifth major title after a costly run of holes around the turn.\n\nMcIlroy was level par after seven holes before running up a double bogey on the signature par-three eighth, the Northern Irishman's first attempt to escape a bunker on the Postage Stamp coming back to his feet.\n\nWith the back nine playing downwind McIlroy was hopeful of repairing the damage, only to drive out of bounds on the 11th to run up another double bogey and eventually finish seven over par, 12 shots behind Lowry.\n\nAsked if he could make up the ground he had conceded, there was a lengthy pause before McIlroy said: \"I mean, all I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut. That's all I can focus on.\"\n\nThe 35-year-old, who agonisingly missed out on an overdue fifth major title in last month's US Open, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine, thinking that I could maybe get those couple of shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who edged out McIlroy at Pinehurst to win his second US Open, also found himself well down the field following a 76, although the American did at least hole from 55 feet for an eagle on the 16th.\n\nSweden's Alex Noren, who only secured his place in the field via a tie for 10th in the Scottish Open on Sunday, was a shot off the pace alongside American Russell Henley and Ryder Cup team-mates Justin Rose and Nicolai Hojgaard. AP\n\nRose, who had to come through a 36-hole qualifier to make it to Troon, carded two birdies and 16 pars in his bogey-free 69.\n\nFew groups left out there. Dan Brown is in one of them, he's on the 15th at the moment and he's still on four-under. To find out how he finished read the report which will land above here soon.\n\nOn the round...\n\nOn whether he's playing as well as he did when he won at Portrush...\n\nAnd the conditions are currently as good as they have been all day. Good news for those late starters, one of whom is Dan Brown on four-under.\n\nSo the world No.1 walks off the 18th with a one-under 70. He was solid rather than spectacular today but that was the order of the day. He's lurking with intent only four off the lead.\n\nSpieth also cards a level-par 71.\n\nAs expected he drains the five-foot birdie putt to card a five-under 66. He was brilliant today, there were no bogeys and he's the man to catch. It's his first blemish-free round since he lifted the Claret Jug at Portrush - is that an omen?\n\nPlaying partner Fitzpatrick ends on one-under and Cam Smith walks off the 18th with an instantly forgettable nine-over (it would have been worse but for a birdie at the last)\n\nHe stiffs his 177-yard approach to five-feet and he'll have yet another great chance to move to five-under. I reckon he'll make this one...\n\nHe never really got going, firing only the one birdie all round.\n\nThe Irishman misses the 12-footer at the 17th. That's three in a row for Shano...he stays at four-under.\n\nHe three-putts the last and ends on a not-pleasing-on-the-eye eight-over 79. He hasn't looked as though he's enjoyed it and looks po-faced walking off the green.\n\nPlaying partner Schauffele has had a much better round and ends with a two-under 69.\n\nAnd he moves into the red on one-under. His round has been solid and is now moving in the right direction. His approach to the par-five was from all of 305 yard and he stiffs it to 16 feet. He makes no mistake with the putter.\n\nPlaying partner Scheffler also has a good look at eagle but his putt stays at ground level. He'll also move to one-under.\n\nHis tee-shot at the par-three fades in toward the pin leaving him a 12-footer to move to five-under.\n\nHis tee-shot at the tricky par-three goes long and left and he's unable to get up and down from there.\n\nHis approach to the final green is also left and long, but its on the dancefloor and he should leave with par...\n\nThat's two good birdie opportunities gone in the past two holes, this second one at the par-five 16th. For once he looks like a mere mortal with the flatstick, his 23-foot attempt not really flirting with the hole. He stays at four-under.\n\nThe golfer - not the Da Vinci code-breaking, much-maligned author - has joined Lowry on four-under thanks to birdie at the 11th. That's back-to-back birdies for the Englishman.\n\nSo stays at four-under, still bogey free...remarkable.\n\nAt the 16th. He found the greenside bunker on the left and an old bit of magic reappeared as his chip from the sand left him a one-foot putt. That's three pars in a row for the Big Beast - a triumph of sorts compared with much of the rest of the round - and he stays at six-over.\n\nThe leader has 137 yards to the pin and as soon as he hits the shot he begins to walk after it, always a good sign and something us happy hackers rarely, if ever, do...He'll have a makeable 12-footer for another birdie to move to five-under.\n\nIs someone you probably haven't heard of (once again, I am not talking about the much-maligned author...), but you have now as he's three-under through 10. The Englishman is blemish free and looking good out there. He's one off the lead...\n\nThe world No.1's birdie putt at 13 is short, and never looks like flirting with the hole. He stays at level-par. It's fair to say struggles on links greens. The longest putt he's made today is 3ft 9in.\n\nIt's come at the par-three 14th. His tee-shot was long but a decent up and down saved par and he stays bogey-free and at four-under.\n\nThanks to his first birdie of the day. It's come at the 14th. Can that prove to be the kickstart the 2020 Open champion needs?\n\nHaving birdied the the Railway Hole 11th, he gives back that shot after his approach at the par-four 12th finds the rough, short and right of the green. His chip leaves him a 30-footer for par and not even the world No 1 can make that putt drop.\n\nIt's a similar story for Schauffele two holes ahead on 14. He bogeys the par-three due to his tee-shot going through the back of the green and then being unable to get up and down from there. He's back to two-under.\n\n...Lowry is No.1 on strokes gained putting.\n\nHis putter was 'hot' a few posts ago, now, having drained an 11-footer at the 12th to stay blemish-free on four-under, I am going to call it 'Planck'*\n\n*Planck temperature, named after the German physicist Max Planck, is equal to about 100 million million million million million degrees, or 10 Kelvin, as if you didn't know...\n\nFor the first time since the third Tiger Woods has a birdie, and boy does he need it. It's come at the 13th after six bogeys (two of them doubles) and moves him back to six-over.\n\nAnd I hope/expect most of you will be more than happy to learn that it's Shane Lowry. The likeable, cuddly Irishman has just birdied the par-four 11th to move to four-under. Pow!\n\nHis approach from 159 yards left him with a 20-foot putt for birdie and he made no mistake with the flatstick. His putter has been the dictionary definition of HOT today. Sizzling...\n\nThe chip on left him with a 26-footer and he's rapidly going in the wrong direction.\n\nMeanwhile, playing partner Schauffele's long putt flirts with the hole but stays above ground. He remains at three-under as a result.\n\nIt's on a slope and won't be easy to get the clubface right behind the ball. However, the Big Beast does well to find the green with his chip, but another longish putt to save par coming up. Once again it looks as though he's having about as much fun as someone told they've got to speed read War and Peace while white-water rafting in crocodile-infested waters...\n\n...you'll have noticed that they all seem to be finding the par-three eighth Postage Stamp a but touch.\n\nGrillo has just become the 18th player to rack up a double bogey or worse at the tiny 118-yarder.\n\n...a train roaring past on your backswing.\n\nXander Schauffele has birdied the 11th to move to three-under and join Justin Thomas and Shane Lowry at the top of the leaderboard.\n\nPlaying partner Tiger Woods blocks his bogey putt and moves to six-over, it cannot be fun for him out there. He doesn't look like he's enjoying it at all...\n\nAnd was forced to take a drop. His third is then well short of the green. Another trial to avoid falling even further back coming up.\n\nAnd thanks to draining a 23-footer at the 10th he stays at three-under. His approach from 125 yards found the right rough and he did very well to walk off the green with a par.\n\nHis drive at the 11th flirts with the railway track and it looks as though it's, at best, in the foliage right by the wall next to the track. That looked like a proper slice - ouch. He takes a provisional and he'll find it tough to stay at four-over.\n\nHe's out in level-par. You don't need to do anything spectacular with the moderate scoring.\n\nWith his chip he has to keep it above the pin as everything slopes away from there. He shows a delicate touch with his third but is left with a four-footer to save par and stay at level-par.\n\nMeanwhile, Koepka birdies the tricky 11th and he's back at two-under.\n\nIt's come at the ninth with a testing seven-footer. He's out in three-under.\n\nThe scoring average on the front nine is one-over and on the back nine it's a bit over two-over, so you need to do your scoring going out.\n\nHis tee-shot found the deep bunker on the left but he was able to get up and down to stay at level-par.\n\nBack-to-back birdies at seven and eight. He had no problem at the Postage Stamp, his tee-shot leaving him with a nine-footer that never looked like going anywhere but underground. He's at three-under looking down on everyone on the leaderboard. Paul McGinley on Sky commentary points out that the 2019 Open champion putts well on slow greens and that's what he's facing at Troon.\n\nThe affable Irishman is now at two-under and well in contention. His 341-yard drive left him a flick with a wedge from 45 yards that he fired to within 10 feet and from there he made no mistake with the flatstick.\n\nHis tee-shot avoided the infamous Coffin Bunker but only just, the ball ending up just short of it in the short rough. But having got lucky his chip is under hit and the ball rolls into the trap he had just avoided. His first attempt to get out ends back at his feet and he does well to get up and down from there to walk off with just a five. He moves to three-over.\n\nStanding on the seventh tee he's level-par, a solid start. That's the same score as playing partner Jordan Spieth, who hooks his tee-shot (with an iron) into the left rough, criminal, but all too easy today.\n\nIt's come at the Postage Stamp and it's all down to a hideous tee-shot that finds the rough beyond the green. In his prime he'd never make a mistake like that. The resulting chip, which was a fine flop shot that flirted with the infamous Coffin Bunker, left him with a 14-foot putt which he was unable to drain. He's now at four-over. After a good start this round is getting away from Tiger...\n\nThat's after a bogey at the par-four seventh. His approach from 136 yards left him shortsided, his chip left him a seven-footer for par and he was unable to sink that.\n\nPostage Stamp coming up for the Big Beast...\n\n...Koepka plays the perfect bunker shot at the Postage Stamp to within a foot of the pin. Many have come a cropper today on a hole where he will, barring a disaster of a missed putt, walk off with a par.\n\nThe American has birdied four in a row to move to two-under. He's won the USPGA and the US Open but having cut his teeth on the European Tour (playing in some far-flung places on the Challenge Tour) you suspect he wouldn't mind drinking something out of the Claret Jug.\n\nThe later chance from seven foot leaves him grimacing, he stays at two-over.\n\nIs what Spanish amateur Jaime Montojo may well be thinking after he holes his approach at the first from 132 yards. The 19-year-old is two-under through one, easy peasy...\n\nBut that horror of a start was forgotten momentarily when he nearly aced the Postage Stamp.\n\nSit back and enjoy this tee-shot and the delicious spin on the ball.\n\nThree-under: Thomas (68)\n\nTwo-under: Noren (69), N Hojgaard (69), Rose 69F), Henley (69), Straka (10)\n\nOne-under: A Scott (70), Wallace (70), Kirk (70), Jordan (7), Koepka (6), Schauffele (5), Lowry (4), Spieth (3), Grillo (2), Hughes (2)\n\nWhich might explain why as many as 16 golfers are under-par now. It was just 12 an hour or so ago.\n\nHaving bogeyed the first he gets the shot back at the third. His 125-yard approach left him with a six-footer for birdie and he drained the putt. Playing partner Jordan Spieth also left the green with a birdie to move to one-under.\n\nMeanwhile, Koepka registers his third birdie in a row after sinking a 27-foot putt at the par-five sixth. He's now at one-under.\n\nThat's thanks to back-to-back birdies at the fourth and fifth. The birdie at the par-three fifth was so very nearly an eagle, on a par-three AKA a hole-in-one...\n\nOnce again the bunkers claim another victim. His tee-shot found the left-greenside bunker, from there he was forced to chip out backwards to the left rough from where he was unable to get up and down. He's back to two-over.\n\nThis is Exhibit A in the 'golf can be (insert rude word of your choosing here) frustrating'.\n\nHis approach to the par-five left him with a chance of birdie, but the attempt went seven-foot by. He missed that par putt and he falls back to level-par as result.\n\nThe 2022 Champion Golfer of the Year is four-over through two thanks to a bogey at the first and a triple at the second. That seven came about due to a hideous tee shot that finds an unplayable. Ouch.\n\nHis tee shot found the right rough, his approach ended up in the right greenside bunker and he wasn't able to get up and down.\n\nHis playing partners Cam Young and Jorden Spieth both walked off with pars.\n\nHe missed the seven-footer at the last and he's got it all to do to if he's going to stay here at the weekend. Regarding lifting the Claret Jug, I think he can forget that now.\n\nHe didn't play that badly, but it was one of those days you can have on links courses, every errant shot was really punished and his putting wasn't great.\n\nTo state the bleedin' obvious: that wasn't the round he wanted following his US Open heartache.\n\nAfter the fine drive he was left with 149 to the pin. His approach went over the flagstick and he then drained the 12-yard breaking putt to move into the red at one-under.\n\nThere are only 14 golfers under par at the moment, and eight of those are at one-under.\n\n'Yet more woe for Rory'...\n\nHe's found a bunker with his tee shot at the 18th - a shot that is all about bunker avoidance. It's an awful lie and he's forced to chip out sideways. His third shot is 123 yards from the pin and he fires his approach to seven feet. He needs to make that to stay at six-over to even have the slimmest, vaguest, need-the-world's-best-microscope-to-see-it chance of staying in this championship come the weekend.\n\nBrian Harman cards a two-over 73. That's a score I suspect many will be fine with today. The Ricky Ponting looky-likely had three birdies and five bogeys.\n\nAfter his poor showing at Pinehurst he'll doubtless be looking for a good week (anything other than a win for him is considered a bad one...) at Troon.\n\nThis one has come at the par-four third. The drive splits the fairway and his swing is looking good at the moment, easy and free. He's level through the first two holes.\n\nAt 17 - having found the bunker he left himself a tough up and down but his sand play was exceptional leaving him a close-to-tap-in putt for a three. He stays at six-over.\n\nThe left-right wind has played havoc with his game on this back nine. His tee shot at the par-three 17th finds the greenside bunker (yep, you've guessed it, another deep and devilish one...) he's shortsided himself and that will be yet another tough up and down* to save par.\n\n*Not sure there are many 'easy' up and downs at Troon today\n\n...found the deep rough to the right of the green (don't worry, it's a par-five and it was his second shot) his chip from the foliage just finds the green and he two putts to stay at six-over.\n\nAs do his playing partners Schauffele and Cantlay. All two-putting. Solid starts from that American trio.\n\nAnd last week's Scottish Open winner (the one non-major he really wanted to claim) ends on one-over, a score many, including him I suspect, will be more than happy with.\n\nPlaying partners Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood didn't enjoy their round as much. The Spaniard carding a two-over 73 and the long-haired Englishman (when is he going to do a Head and Shoulders advert?) finishing on five-over.\n\nTiger has 166 yard to the pin at the first and his approach finds the green, leaving him a longish putt for par.\n\nAs Andrew Coltart, on Sky commentary, says \"what would he do for the temperature to be a few degrees warmer.\"\n\nRather than trying to muscle a long-iron and it's a good choice as the Big Beast finds splits the fairway.\n\nPlaying partner Xander Schauffle finds the first cut on the right. Completing the threeball is Patrick Cantlay and the American, known for slow play, dividing opinion and not wearing baseball caps (when he doesn't have to....) also finds the short grass.\n\nThat's my way of saying it's raining again...conditions look pretty dire on the west coast of Scotland right now. Tiger Woods is about to get his opening round under way, wonder how the conditions will affect him and his creaking body?\n\nWell, that's actually a load of nonsense but it's certainly what DeChambeau will be thinking (if only for sanity's sake...) as he drains a 54-foot putt for eagle at the par-five 16th. That gets him back to five-over having had a 'mare of a front nine (out in a six-over 42).\n\nAnd the five-time major winner takes an iron and finds the left rough.\n\nHis chip from the pot bunker was impressive, the ball finding the green. But it left him with a breaking, downhill putt and his attempt to save par never really flirted with the hole. He could well have already played himself out of contention here...\n\nBut, alas, I am about to bring yet more bad Rory news (I am truly sorry...). His drive at the 15th found the left rough and his second found one of the many devilish pot bunkers that litter Troon. This one is a good 30 yards short of the green.\n\nThe American is four-over through three holes having registered back-to-back double bogeys at the second and third.\n\n2.26pm Wyndham Clark (USA), Brooks Koepka (USA), Hideki Matsuyama (Jap)\n\n2.37pm Patrick Cantlay (USA), Xander Schauffele (USA), Tiger Woods (USA)\n\n2.48pm Sam Burns (USA), Si-Woo Kim (Kor), Collin Morikawa (USA)\n\n2.59pm Matthew Fitzpatrick, Shane Lowry, Cameron Smith (Aus)\n\n3.10pm Scottie Scheffler (USA), Jordan Spieth (USA), Cameron Young (USA)\n\nThat's three pars in a row which after the four-hole stretch in five-over may well feel like Christmas for the world No.2. At the par-three 14th his tee shot found the light rough on the right, but he made a tricky up-and-down (nine-foot par putt) and perhaps that can be a bit of a confidence booster for him? He stays at five-over.\n\n...it hasn't really got going for Tommy Fleetwood today. A three-putt bogey means he walks off the 15th at four-over.\n\nIt's Sam Hutsby who after seven was joint-leader at three-under. But the shortest hole proved a bit of a card-wreaker (for the umpteenth time). He found one of the many deep and infamous bunkers, it took two shots to get out and walked off with a five to fall back to one-under.\n\nMeanwhile, it's back-to-back pars for Rory, he's still at five-over, through 13.\n\n...is going considerably better than his front nine. There are no fireworks, but after going out in 42 he really won't mind...He's opened up the inward nine with four straight pars to stay at six-over.\n\nMeanwhile, Rory walks off the 12th with a very welcome (as in give it a massive bear hug) par to stay at five-over.\n\nHe's had a delightful start to his opening round. While others are struggling (still only 12 golfers under par) he's three-under through seven 'who said it was tough?'.\n\nStanding on the 15th tee he's at one-over having bogeyed the 13th. He's registered just the one birdie today and I reckon he'll be more than happy to get into the clubhouse at level par.\n\nI'm no meteorologist but I feel fairly confident when I say 'it's not great'...rain is falling and the wind is still more than making hits presence felt. The sort of conditions where you cannot wait to get to the 19th hole.\n\nThat's because he's double-bogeyed the 11th. His drive went out of bounds (over the train tracks) and it was downhill from there. His fourth went over the back of the green and he walked off with a six, to fall to five-over.\n\nTwo doubles in the past four holes - ouch!\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports the former US Open champion felt he could have gone lower that his two-under 69...\n\nQuite a few struggling out there at the moment would kill for that score right now.\n\nBut he couldn't maintain the fine form and ends on at definitely-not-to-be-sniffed-at one-under.\n\nHe's bogeyed the 12th and many people's tip to lift the Claret Jug has a bit of work to do.\n\nThink it's fair to say that the world's best are finding it tough out there.\n\nHis drive at the 11th is out of bounds. The wind is left to right and it a tough tee shot for a right-hander do you fight the wind or ping the drive far left and use it...the train tracks on the right of the fairway serves as an industrial reminder to execute the shot well...alas for Rory he didn't, it looks as though the ball ended to the right of the line to Glasgow.\n\nHe misses the eight-footer and that isn't the start to the 'easier' back nine he would have wanted. Big (ish) eight holes coming up for the Northern Irishman.\n\nHis 104-yard approach was pulled slightly leaving him with a tricky up and down from 18 yards. He went with the putter and was cautious...\n\nAnd it's JT (Justin Thomas as if you didn't know...). His tee shot at the last found the fairway, and his approach from 176 yards found the dancefloor and he drained the 25-footer to finish birdie-birdie and move to three-under.\n\nHe stays at two-over after a good up and down from off the green on the right.\n\nSays the 1997 Open champion, Justin Leonard. He's nine-over and while that may well lead anyone to say 'it's not easy' the leaderboard backs up his bleak summary, there are only 12 golfers under par at the moment.\n\nThe memorable win eight years ago was one for the ages and possibly the best final round in a major you'll ever see as he held off the considerable challenge of Phil Mickelson.\n\nHis tee-shot finds the first cut on the left.\n\nAnd he's bounced back well from the double and single bogeys at 12 and 13 respectively.\n\nHis tee shot at the last finds the fairway which is A1, the main aim on the tee box being bunker avoidance.\n\nAnd they're the lucky leaders six hours into play.\n\n...two-over. Not disastrous by any stretch of the imagination, but not the start he'd have wanted.\n\nScott and Henley bogey to drop out of leading pack, and then there were five. It has been a pretty enjoyable morning at Royal Troon, what with all the chip ins, double and triples. And there's so much for the play.\n\nThe top of the leaderboard is getting a little cramped now, with seven players up there. Recent additions include Hojgaard, Chris Kirk and Kim Min-kyu. Thomas has now fallen back to -1 after going double-bogey, bogey, par in his last three holes.\n\nThe Aussie has been playing some very confident golf of late. He has just birdied 15 to put himself into the mix at the top of the leaderboard. This is Adam Scott's 93rd consecutive major. Incredible.\n\nTwo shots dropped for Thomas after a disastrous 12th hole, and he's back into a four way tie for the lead with Justin Rose, Russell Henley and Alex Noren who has just finished his round. A solid 69 on his opening round for the Swede.\n\nIt hasn't been the start that US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau would have wanted at the 152nd Open Championship. The big hitter has had three lip outs in his first four holes and sits at +3.\n\nThat's more like it from McIlroy. He puts his approach to a few feet and makes the putt for birdie, making up for that sloppy bogey on the first. His drive on the par 5 4th finds its way into the long grass on the left. Hatton, who also birdied the last, ends up in a similar position to Rory.\n\nAfter a nice approach to 10, Justin Thomas drops another to extend his lead to two. Been a really solid round of play so far from the two-time major champion. Is he finding his from at just the right time?\n\nAfter such a bright start, Matt Wallace pays the price for a wild second on the 9th and just like that he's back to -1. Triple Bogey.\n\nPoor start for Rory considering he was in prime position from the fairway on 1. Many many holes to go though. He goes with mid iron off the tee on 2 into the wind. Lands it in the fairway.\n\nAnother one drops at the Postage Stamp, this time for Matt Wallace who is now in a solo lead at -4 after Song shoots a triple bogey on 11. That lead might not last very long though for Wallace, as his approach to the 9th is erratic, unforced and far right into the bush.\n\nPostage Stamp clearly not playing at its hardest today, with a handful of birdies to speak of at the 8th so far. Justin Thomas has just added to the birdie tally to put himself back into the lead at -3 alongside Song and Wallace.\n\nThe Swede sinks one from the edge of the green, cool as you like, for the ideal start. DeChambeau missed his par putt. His tee shot put him behind the eight ball though.\n\nComing off an emotional victory at The Renaissance Club last week, Robert MacIntyre is in the form of his life and as well equipped as anyone to beat the field this week. The Scotsman is no stranger to the links layout as well. If he wins this week he'll be the second consecutive lefty (or 'southpaw') to win The Open after Brian Harman's victory at Royal Liverpool last year.\n\nHojgaard reclaims the shot he lost at the last with a great putt on Postage Stamp. Adam Scott replenishes the scorecard with a bird of his own from the other side of the hole to Hojgaard. Both move to -2.\n\nSome huge names are about to tee it up in the next half an hour or so:\n\nSong's lengthy par putt slips just wide of the mark and he drops back into a tie of the lead with Matt Wallace. Hojgaard also makes bogey on 7, falling back to -1.\n\nFrancesco Molinari has plotted his way around the first six holes of his Open Championship very nicely. He hasn't put (or putt) a foot wrong thus far, carding two birdies and four pars. He sits two off early leader Song.\n\nBriton Matt Wallace holes out for eagle from middle of the 4th fairway bringing him to -3 in an instant. His playing partner Hojgaard places it in the heart of the green. The Danes lag put comes up just short.\n\nThe Korean retakes the lead with a great birdie on 7 then steps up on the tee at the difficult 8th, sticks it within five feet and sinks it to double his lead. Super stuff.\n\nAlex Noren rolls one in at pace from a mile away to tie the lead then Justin Thomas does the same from 10 feet or so to make it a four way tie at the top.\n\nThe Dane has played the opening four holes effortlessly, two birdies, two pars, perfect start. That said, I still can't tell the difference between him and twin brother Rasmus. Let's just hope for the spectators sake the brothers aren't battling it out for the win on Sunday, that might get a little confusing. Nicolai finds the green on the par 3 5th.\n\nThese players are so sharp around the greens. This time Sungjae Im chips in from the edge of the 3rd, following Scott, Hojgaard and Thomas who have all holed out from off the green this morning.\n\nSome big names starting to make moves. Justin Thomas chips in brilliantly from off the back of 2. Rose gives himself a few feet for birdie with his superlative approach. He makes the birdie putt and moves into the red.\n\nNo player has reached the 8th yet (Alex Noren is nearly there) so before they do let's have a look at Royal Troon's most famous - or infamous - hole and what not to do when playing it.\n\nWinds are moving at around 12-15mph with gusts of up to 23mph. It's not very cold, around 18 degress celsius. It has started to drizzle in South Ayrshire too, even covering some of the TV cameras.\n\nMolinari holes out well as the wind starts to pick up in South Ayrshire. Rose's putt skirts by on the right. Par for him. On 2, Nicolai Hojgaard chips in from the edge of the green.\n\nThe American hits a towering hybrid shot into the middle of the first cut to get his Open underway. Thomas has fallen to number 29 in the Official World Golf Rankings, but he and everyone else knows he's better than that. Can he win his first Claret Jug this week?\n\nExplosive start from the Korean. He birdies from just inside 15 feet to take the early lead.\n\nRose and Molinari both stick it close, Rose just inside the Italian. Good start from the Ryder Cup heroes.\n\n2018 champ Francesco Molinari couldn't place it better on the introductory hole, right down the middle. Justin Rose, however, finds the straw. Amateur Jasper Stubbs, playing his second major, goes far and right, may be out of bounds. Not a nice feeling for Stubbs. Playing a provisional he stripes it out the middle though.\n\nWhat a bunker shot from the 2013 Masters champion. Over the lip, a bounce, a roll and a hole out. Scott, Ryosuke Kinoshita and Song Young-han all tied at the top on -1 now.\n\nFrom a great position, Scott pulls it left into the sand trap. That's frustrating.\n\nThe familiar gracious swing of Adam Scott at the first. He finds the second cut on the right of the fairway, perfect positioning really. Is he still feeling the sting of his Open Championship meltdown of 2012 at Royal Lytham & St Anne's? After finishing solo 2nd at last week's Scottish Open, the Aussie could be one to watch at Troon this week.\n\nThe peripheral long straw is already causing players some strife. A perfect example on the first with Lee and Hisatsune hacking out and finding the high-faced bunkers.\n\nAnd Northern Irishman Tom McKibbin sinks one of his own moments later on the third from 20 feet. The players are starting to find their mojo.\n\nMin Woo Lee pushes an iron into the rough, Hisatsune and Ancer split the fairway. Still no birdies in this opening round. Early early doors though...\n\nHere's a heart warming story. Michael Hendry has teed off at The Open this morning having recovered from a serious Leukemia diagnosis, a diagnosis that put him out of action for Royal Liverpool last year. Now he's back, swinging well again and ready to take on the might of Royal Troon. Find out more about his story in the video below.\n\nFamous announcer Ivor Robson is remembered before tee off. Winner at Royal Troon in 1997, Justin Leonard steps up to the tee. He stripes it out the par 4 1st with an iron to get things under way. 2004 champion Todd Hamilton, also using an iron, fades one out onto the fairway and debutant Jack McDonald follows suit with a beautifully rhythmic drive, placing on the short stuff. We're off at the 152nd Open Championship.\n\n7:41 a.m. - Francesco Molinari, Justin Rose, Jasper Stubbs (a)\n\n2:15 p.m. - Padraig Harrington, Davis Thompson, Matthew Jordan\n\n2:26 p.m. - Wyndham Clark, Hideki Matsuyama, Brooks Koepka\n\n2:37 p.m. - Tiger Woods, Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay\n\n3:10 p.m. - Jordan Spieth, Scottie Scheffler, Cameron Young\n\nGood morning to those bleary-eyed of you who have raised in time to catch the early starters at the opening of The 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon.\n\nSandwiched between the European Championship and the Olympic Games, this year's tournament has a chance to breathe in what is a short week-long hiatus between those two major sporting events.\n\nIt is unquestionably the marquee event of the week and with a mix of wind, sun and rain forecast in Ayrshire, this promises a classic links challenge to the finest players in the world.\n\nAmong them, of course, is Rory McIlroy, who is playing his second tournament since his meltdown during the closing stages of the US Open at Pinehurst last month.\n\nA fourth-place finish at last week's Scottish Open suggests his game remains in good shape but whether he is ready mentally for the cauldron of a The Open, so soon after throwing away a fifth major championship, remains to be seen.\n\nThe Northern Irishman is out at 10.09 this morning alongside Max Homa and Tyrell Hatton in what looks like the headline group among the early starters. Click here for full round one tee times.\n\nLater in the day, Tiger Woods gets underway at 2.47pm on a course at which he has played three times during The Open. A three-time winner of this event, Woods has struggled here, with his ninth-placed finish in 2004 his best showing.\n\nPay close attention to Hole 8 this morning - named Postage Stamp. What looks like an easy 123-yard Par 3 is perhaps the hardest of its kind played at any Open venue.\n\nSharp slopes all around the green are ready to take errant tee shots into the penal greenside bunkers, while the putting surface itself is, at most, 11 paces wide.\n\nWith the wind set to touch 30mph around midday, Postage Stamp could yet bare its teeth to the very best in the world. It just might make you all feel a touch better about your games to see a pro take seven from 123 yards.\n\nGrab a coffee and let's enjoy a superb morning of action from Royal Troon.", "source":

He began the first round on Thursday with a 3-under 68 that set an early target and left him satisfied.\n\nNever mind that 62 he had a week ago in the Scottish Open. Royal Troon required hard work, and with just enough rain and plenty of wind the links along the Ayrshire coast showed it was capable of punishing players without notice.\n\nU.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau kept missing par putts, wound up with a 76 and was headed to the range to figure out his equipment and why his golf ball didn't leave the club the way he expected.\n\n\"It was a weird day,\" he said.\n\nRory McIlroy, hopeful of bouncing back from his U.S. Open collapse, took a double bogey on the famed \"Postage Stamp\" eighth hole, and piped a driver out of bounds on the 11th for another double bogey. It added to a 7-over 78, his worst start to a major in five years.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job,\" he said.\n\nThomas was not immune.\n\nHe was one of three players who reached 4 under among the early starters and had the wind at his back for the inward nine at Troon. And then his tee shot landed in a bush that required a penalty drop and he missed a 4-foot putt and made double bogey. His next drive took a wild hop into grass so deep his caddie called out to the gallery, \"Last call. Anyone see the other ball to the right?\" They eventually found it, but it led to bogey.\n\n\"A little bit of a hiccup in the beginning of the back nine but stayed patient and kept plugging,\" Thomas said.\n\nIndeed, Thomas managed to keep it together. He avoided another bogey with a 12-foot par putt, and finished with a 6-iron to 8 feet for birdie on the 17th and a birdie on the 18th that showed how much wind was helping -- 4-iron off the tee, wedge into 25 feet on the 458-yard closing hole.\n\nJustin Rose, who had to go through final qualifying to get into the Open, was equally impressive by playing bogey-free for a 69, joined by a group that included Nicolai Hojgaard of Denmark and Alex Noren, who only qualified through the Scottish Open.\n\nMatt Wallace was one of those at 4 under early in his round, only to take triple bogey on the ninth hole.

It was on the treacherous par four where the Irishman snapped in four-lettered fury.\n\nThe 2019 champion hit his tee shot into the rough on this brutal driving hole with a train track on one side and thick gorse on the other, but when he tried to extricate himself from the cabbage his ball flew left into a bush.\n\nImmediately, Lowry swivelled and let the cameraman have it. \"As I was over the ball I could just see you putting your f------' camera up,\" Lowry said. \"Just get outta the way. Just get back there. F--- sake!\"\n\nLowry's contention was that the man moved in the middle of his backswing and was clearly incensed. But later the 37-year-old played down the incident. \"There was a cameraman there, and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry said. \"As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it - my own fault.\"\n\nLowry believed he had \"done the hard part\" by putting his drive in play. As it proved, he was unlucky that his ball was found in the bush, because he had hit a provisional to 10 feet to give himself the opportunity to limit the damage to a bogey. But a spectator located the first ball, meaning it was still in play and after a 20-minute wait to ascertain where he could drop the ball, the best Lowry could escape with was a six.\n\nDavid Howell, the former Ryder Cup player who is working for Sky this week as an on-course commentator, revealed that the fan who found the ball was \"a little sheepish\" when he realised Lowry did not want that to happen. \"He's feeling awful,\" Howell said.\n\nNevertheless, Lowry birdied the 16th and 18th to claw back the shots and is pleased with how he reacted. \"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times,\" he said. \"This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with how things have gone.

However, he drove out of bounds on the 11th hole, resulting in another double bogey. He ended the day at seven over par, trailing clubhouse leader Justin Thomas by 10 shots.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who narrowly missed out on securing his long-awaited fifth major title at last month's US Open, said: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau also didn't fare well\n\nBryson DeChambeau, who narrowly defeated McIlroy at Pinehurst to secure his second US Open title, also struggled in the field after shooting a 76. However, the American managed to salvage his round with a 55-foot eagle on the 16th hole.\n\nDeChambeau's front nine of 42 featured a double bogey on the 612-yard sixth hole, where his second shot advanced only a few yards from the heavy rough before he had to hit his next shot onto the adjacent 13th fairway.\n\nThe morning conditions, marked by light rain and gusty winds of up to 23 miles per hour, created chaos for the golfers.\n\nJustin Thomas rising to the occasion\n\nDespite the challenging weather, Justin Thomas managed to secure a 3-under round, bolstered by two birdies at the end of his round, allowing him to hold a strong position on the leaderboard for much of the morning.\n\nThomas started strong with a chip-in birdie on the par-4 second hole and added three more birdies while making just one bogey to reach the turn at 3-under 33. However, his momentum faltered on the back nine. A poorly pulled tee shot on the 12th forced him to take a penalty drop, resulting in a double-bogey. He further struggled on the 13th, where he pushed his drive into the high rough on the right, leading to another bogey.\n\nThomas ended his round strong, sinking birdies on the last two holes, including a 25-footer on No. 18. This finish brought him back to 3 under par, placing him one stroke ahead of Alex Noren, Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard, Justin Rose, and Russell Henley.\n\nCameron Smith, the 2021 champion at St. Andrews, struggled with an 80.

Another 25-foot birdie effort at the 13th put him into red figures.\n\nAfter last year's runner-up's spot at Royal Liverpool which completed his set of second-place finishes at all the majors, former world No.1 Day is now looking to go one better at Troon and add a second big-four crown to the PGA Championship he won nine years ago.\n\nHis cause was helped when both the overnight pacesetters stuttered while trying to consolidate their advantage.\n\nShane Lowry grabbed the outright lead, then had it torn away from him in his roller-coaster round.\n\nThe 2019 champion recorded three more birdies before the turn to move to seven under and open up a two-shot advantage over England's overnight leader Dan Brown.\n\nLowry had dropped his first shot of the tournament after 23 holes when finding the bunker at the par-three fifth, but otherwise looked in complete control as he sank birdie putts from nine feet at the first, tap-in range at the long fourth and 11 feet at the ninth.\n\nBut the Irishman had a calamity at the 11th when he pulled his second shot into the gorse, took a penalty drop and hit his fourth on to the green, only for his original ball to be found by a spectator.\n\nThat meant it was still in play and, after a long delay while it was determined where he could best take a drop, Lowry hit his approach just short of the green and eventually completed a double-bogey six to fall back to the joint-lead on five under.\n\nLowry was playing alongside Australia's 2022 champ Cam Smith, whose miserable Open continued following his first-round 80, his worst ever round in a major.\n\nThree more bogeys in the first six holes were offset by the blessed relief of a rare birdie at the seventh but at 11 over after 13 holes the 30-year-old was sure to miss the cut, which was projected to be at four over.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

He has had many brilliant moments behind him, but many nostalgically recall the moment when the Irishman lifted the trophy five years ago, winning the Open Championship. It remains the only Major on Lowry's resume.\n\nDespite being close to winning Majors many times as a 37-year-old, slight differences meant that Lowry returned home without a trophy.\n\nJudging by his success five years ago, this tournament suits him well, and Lowry has high ambitions. Ahead of another edition of the Open Championship, Lowry reflected on the words of his compatriot Harrington, who often advises him. Padraig revealed to him that when he was 37, it was also one of his best years in golf. Lowry hopes for the same.\n\n\"I remember saying that to Padraig at the start of the year and he said when he was 37 he had one of his bets years so I'm still holding on to that,\" -Lowry said, as reported by Irish Golfer.\n\nBuilding a career as an athlete and as a golfer involves always dreaming of winning trophies, leading the way, and leaving a mark in history. When you see yourself succeeding in these aspirations, your appetite grows. Lowry has realized many times in his career that he has the potential for great things, and his hunger for victories is becoming greater and greater. During the press conference, he was visibly upbeat and smiling, ready to win Majors once again.\n\n\"I feel like when you've tasted success, you just want it even more. That's just the way it is. I feel like I wanted so bad to win another one. Just give me one more and I'll be happy. (Laughing) That's all I want. It is too much to ask for.\"- Lowry continued.\n\nShane Lowry has had his best season yet on the PGA Tour. He stresses the unpredictable nature of golf, having experienced both highs, like shooting two 62s, and lows, such as an 85. Despite setbacks, he emphasizes the transient nature of success and adversity in the sport.\n\nReflecting on recent tournaments, he faced challenges but remained competitive, highlighting his satisfaction with his current form and performance this season. Looking ahead, he remains focused on the upcoming opportunities to excel in major championships, aware of their importance following his 2019 Open victory.\n\nThe Irishman points out that it is imperative in every tournament to reach the very end and win the trophy. However, there are differences in winning some other tournaments and Majors, especially the British Open. As a boy, Lowry heard stories about the claret jug, desiring to lift it. He considers this tournament the biggest in the world.\n\n\"You drive in here and you see the claret jug when you are registering and the history with it and the golf course and the magnitude of it is just big, I think it is the biggest tournament in the world and it certainly feels like that when you are here and it feels like that when you are preparing.\"- Lowry continued.\n\nShane Lowry strives to maintain a specific mentality of calmness. However, he acknowledges that this tournament is one of the biggest in the world of golf, and winning it holds a special meaning. Lowry emphasizes his desire to play the best golf he can, admitting that he feels anxious and nervous at times. Nevertheless, he finds that once he steps onto the golf course and reaches the first tee, he believes he'll be okay and without nerves.\n\nLowry tries to work on various aspects of his game week by week, with the intention of improving. The Irishman does not want to watch things silently, aware that his competition is training and striving for progress, just like him.\n\nHe feels that he has made significant progress with his putting since the Zurich Classic, even though he wasn't entirely comfortable during that event, despite winning. In the weeks following, he feels he has turned a corner and now feels confident with his putting stroke. Lowry often mentions that his ability to hole putts is crucial for his competitiveness in tournaments, and he remains optimistic about his chances moving forward.\n\nIt will be interesting to follow his performance and see what kind of form Lowry is in at the moment. Playing in this tournament is a special feeling. The fact that he already excelled playing the Open five years ago certainly gives him additional confidence.

While obviously a tremendous golfer, his record overall at The Open Championship is sketchy, and he's put together an uneven season to this point. But after serving as the 18-hole leader last week at the Scottish Open, Thomas -- who held the lead out of the morning wave Thursday at Royal Troon -- sits just three shots back of leader Daniel Brown (-6).\n\nPlaying in the slightly more difficult morning wave, J.T. made seven birdies in his round. While his driving got a bit loose at times -- specifically early in his back nine -- his tee to green play overall was terrific, just as it was last week in Round 1 at The Renaissance Club.\n\nThomas is somebody whose Open record is not as good as it likely should be. In seven starts, he has just one top 30 finish to go with three missed cuts. He opened last year's Open with an 82 in the first round. These numbers are especially curious when considering Thomas' game, which is creative and built for the wind and the elements.\n\nThat shined Thursday in a way it has not in past years at this event.\n\n\"I felt like I had great control off the tee,\" he said. \"I hit some great drives, and I felt like I was creative on some of them of just trying to hold it against the winds, off the tees to make the fairways a little bigger and hold it in the fairways. Felt like I had a couple times that I could have maybe been a little bit more aggressive, but I just felt like it wasn't the right time or necessarily didn't need to.\"\n\nThat mindset also represents a maturity J.T. admitted to not always having when it comes to this tournament.\n\n\"I think that's parts of links golf and also just of golf in general that I've gotten better at and matured,\" he added. \"I feel better about this round than I did the one last week [when I led the Scottish Open] just in the sense of, I would say, the quality of play.\"\n\nWhether Thomas can take advantage of a great first round this week (unlike last week when he tumbled to a T62 finish) remains to be seen. He'll have to continue to putt decently -- perhaps not as well as his 3 strokes gained putting Thursday -- but given the trouble lurking off the tee at Royal Troon and how wild Thomas can sometimes be, the putter will have to save some strokes if he wants to truly contend this weekend.\n\nThere is a long way to go, and it's been a few years since Thomas put together four great rounds consecutively at a big event. But Thursday's opening effort continues a small but meaningful trend of good play early in tournaments.\n\nAnd wouldn't it be very golf if the two guys who beat everyone in the world at the U.S. Open a month ago (Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy) struggled to make the cut while the guy who shot a million (or 82) a year ago at this tournament went on to win the Claret Jug.\n\nThe favorite is lurking\n\nIf I'm J.T. or Shane Lowry or anyone holding the top handful of spots on the leaderboard, I'm quite concerned about Scottie Scheffler. Not because he's the No. 1 player in the world or the first golfer since Arnold Palmer in 1962 to win six times this quickly in a season but because he had a terrifyingly good Round 1 in which he was one of just 17 golfers under par only needing to make three putts outside of 5 feet.\n\n\"It's definitely frustrating when you're watching it 3 feet out and you think it's going to go in and it just doesn't,\" Scheffler said. At the end of the day, I pride myself on preparation and showing up ready to go. If I hit a really good putt from 15, 20 feet -- greens aren't perfect. It's not a perfect surface. You get wind and all kinds of stuff, and I'm lipping out. It's almost like you're just playing a numbers game. If I continue to hit really good putts, then eventually they will start falling in.\n\n\"That's kind of how I felt today. I don't really feel like I made many putts, but I felt like I hit a lot of quality putts, which for me is really good.\"\n\nIn other words: Scottie flushed it Thursday and barely got anything out of the round. His work off the tee was exquisite, holding balls against the wind and controlling everything quite well. His approach play was his usual Scottie Scheffler self. There's a 65 sitting in there if he continues to hit it like this, and I'm not sure this field or this tournament is built to withstand Scottie galloping from out in front with a 65 on his card.\n\nBe prepared; it's coming.\n\nWind golf\n\nIt's just so different. You have to hit it so well and make such great decisions throughout the entire round.\n\n\"We had it close to this yesterday,\" Jordan Spieth explained. \"We didn't have much wind the other days, so certainly, I think when you start hitting certain shots off the tee, they just -- like that front nine, all of us were short on everything as everybody was all day. And I think that was not quite being used to, so hopefully make the adjustment for tomorrow.\"\n\nThis was obvious all day but especially in the early wave. Sepp Straka, who shot a 1-under 70 a bit later on, summed it up well: \"You kind of have your mindset that's where it's going to be, and that's kind of part of the tournament. It almost makes it more fun when the conditions are like that, obviously when you're playing well. If you're not playing well, it just makes it annoying. You just got to focus on your shot. It does make it a little bit harder to do that. It's a little easier to kind of get in a funk out there when it's raining and kind of chilly.\"\n\nIt's the one variable in the game that players hate the most, but it also produces the most interesting shots and most thoughtful course management. After a few years of no wind at all, it was refreshing to see it howl a bit on Thursday to start the tournament.\n\nStaying within five\n\nThe last 24 Open winners have been within five strokes of the lead after 18 holes, according to Justin Ray. That means one of the following golfers will win this year's Open\n\nDaniel Brown: -6Shane Lowry: -5Justin Thomas: -3Alex Noren, Nicolai Hojgaard, Justin Rose, Russell Henley, Xander Schauffele, Mackenzie Hughes, Joe Dean: -2Adam Scott, Matt Wallace, Chris Kirk, Sepp Straka, Brooks Koepka, Matt Fitzpatrick, Scottie Scheffler: -1\n\nObviously, there are some fascinating names in that group, including Koepka, who is going for his sixth major. Schauffele is seeking his second in the last three attempts.\n\nThere have been 10 first-time Champion Golfers of the Year starting with Phil Mickelson in 2013 through to Brian Harman in 2023. The all-time record stands at 11 from 1994 to 2004.\n\nZurich Classic flip\n\nDid you think, after watching the Zurich Classic, that there would be a 12-stroke difference between the two guys who won the tournament? I did ... just not in this direction with Lowry at 5 under and Rory McIlroy at 7 over. Truly shocking stuff given how both of them were playing in New Orleans not that long ago.\n\nPostage Stamp fun\n\nThe shortest hole at Royal Troon is also the best hole on the course. The 120-yard par-3 8th hole -- nicknamed the Postage Stamp -- was amazing Thursday, and it is emblematic of what I believe is one of the best parts of the Open. There are easy doubles and triples lurking everywhere.\n\nRory McIlroy missed his spot by a couple of feet the 8th hole and made a 5, which led to a 78 for the round. That doesn't happen at most other events (even at major championships).\n\n\"I completely agree [that short par 3s are the best],\" said Thomas, who made a birdie on the 8th with a nifty spinner. \"I would double down by saying all the worst par-3s in the world are the long ones. I've never played a bad one that's 120 yards. The 8th hole here is a great example of that, especially given certain winds. You're very happy to walk off with a 3. It was nice to make a 2 today.\"\n\nThe Open rules\n\nThe Open can be so unhinged. Dan Brown, who has missed six of his last seven cuts and finished 61st at the Scottish Open last week, beat McIlroy, who has finished in the top five across five of his last seven events (including a T4 at the Scottish Open), by 13 shots. Thirteen!\n\nBrooks Koepka summed this up nicely: \"Look, there's a lot of good players, and when they play well, you can control your ball. Links golf, if you're creative enough, you can find different ways to get it near the hole.\"\n\nBut Adam Scott offered this warning: \"It's sometimes easy to scrap it around the links, but you're not going to hole a lot of 40-footers. So, at some point, you're going to need to hit some really quality iron shots from the fairway to get it in close to some tucked pins and give yourself more realistic chances. They're the guys who are going to be up there at the end of the week.\"\n\nFor 18 holes, anybody can get in the mix. Even Daniel Brown, who has one win as a professional ... ever. That's enough to dream on, even if the likelihood of holding off Scheffler and Co. for 54 more is not realistic. Sometimes, though, you just need a sliver of hope. Still, it will be hitters only come Saturday and Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_porter@cbssports.com", "name": "Kyle

Another 25-foot birdie effort at the 13th put him into red figures.\n\nAfter last year's runner-up's spot at Royal Liverpool which completed his set of second-place finishes at all the majors, former world No.1 Day is now looking to go one better at Troon and add a second big-four crown to the PGA Championship he won nine years ago.\n\nHis cause was helped when both the overnight pacesetters stuttered while trying to consolidate their advantage.\n\nShane Lowry grabbed the outright lead, then had it torn away from him in his roller-coaster round.\n\nThe 2019 champion recorded three more birdies before the turn to move to seven under and open up a two-shot advantage over England's overnight leader Dan Brown.\n\nLowry had dropped his first shot of the tournament after 23 holes when finding the bunker at the par-three fifth, but otherwise looked in complete control as he sank birdie putts from nine feet at the first, tap-in range at the long fourth and 11 feet at the ninth.\n\nBut the Irishman had a calamity at the 11th when he pulled his second shot into the gorse, took a penalty drop and hit his fourth on to the green, only for his original ball to be found by a spectator.\n\nThat meant it was still in play and, after a long delay while it was determined where he could best take a drop, Lowry hit his approach just short of the green and eventually completed a double-bogey six to fall back to the joint-lead on five under.\n\nLowry was playing alongside Australia's 2022 champ Cam Smith, whose miserable Open continued following his first-round 80, his worst ever round in a major.\n\nThree more bogeys in the first six holes were offset by the blessed relief of a rare birdie at the seventh but at 11 over after 13 holes the 30-year-old was sure to miss the cut, which was projected to be at four over.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma was hanging by a thread after fighting back with birdies on the 15th and 16th holes in the second round of the 152nd Open here on Friday.\n\nRoyal Troon (Scotland), Jul 19 (PTI) Indian golfer Shubhankar Sharma was hanging by a thread after fighting back with birdies on the 15th and 16th holes in the second round of the 152nd Open here on Friday.\n\nSharma, who turns 28 on Sunday, the final day of this edition of the Open, had two bogeys on the seventh and the ninth, which pushed him to 7-over for the tournament, as the cut looked likely at either 5-over or 6-over.\n\nAlso Read | India Beat Pakistan By 7 Wickets in Women's Asia Cup T20 2024; Bowlers Star as Harmanpreet Kaur and Co Get Off to Winning Start.\n\nA birdie on the 12th was followed by a bogey on the 14th but he then showed his fighting abilities.\n\nHe birdied from 20 feet on the 15th and added another on the Par-5 16th to get to 5-over. Then, he gave back a shot on the 17th and dropped to 6-over and was tied 71st with one more hole to come. With 70 and ties making the cut, Sharma was still in with a chance.\n\nAlso Read | Legends Intercontinental T20 Unveils Trophy Ahead of Inaugural Season.\n\nAs Sharma was fighting hard to stay on for the weekend, Shane Lowry moved into pole position for a second Open title, after having won his first five years ago at home in Portrush.\n\nLowry (66-69) was 7-under and two shots clear of two Englishmen Justin Rose (69-68) and little-known Dan Brown (65-72).\n\nWorld No. 1 Scottie Scheffler (70-70) was lurking around in tied fourth alongside fellow American Billy Horschel (72-68) and South African Dean Burmester (71-69) at 2-under 140 for 36 holes.\n\nMeanwhile, a bunch of bigwigs and legends made an early exit as they were swept aside by the southerly wind across the Firth of Clyde at the Royal Troon.\n\nTiger Woods said he would be back at Portrush, but will not play again this year till his own Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas and the PNC Father-Son tournament.\n\nWoods shot 79-77 and was 14-over but smiled and said, \"I'd like to have played more, but I just wanted to make sure that I was able to play the major championships this year. I got a lot of time off to get better, to be better physically, which has been the case all year.\n\n\"I've gotten better, even though my results really haven't shown it, but physically I've gotten better, which is great. I just need to keep progressing like that and then eventually start playing more competitively and start getting into kind of the competitive flow again.\"\n\nAs for playing Majors and coming back for them, he said, \"No, I loved it. I've always loved playing major championships. I just wish I was more physically sharp coming into the majors.\n\n\"Obviously it tests you mentally, physically, emotionally, and I just wasn't as sharp as I needed to be. I was hoping that I would find it somehow, just never did. Consequently, my results and scores were pretty high.\"\n\nOn returning to Portrush for the 2025 Open, he added, \"Yeah, definitely. Okay, sorry. That's a year away.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Indian-Americans Akshay Bhatia and Sahith Theegala were headed home early.\n\nBhatia (76-73) at 7-over was headed home while Theegala, who was 6-over for first round, was 5-over through the front nine.\n\nAaron Rai, the Englishman with a touch of India in him, shot 73 in the first round and was 3-over through 14 in the second to be 5-over.\n\nLowry, whose sole PGA Tour win this season came in the company of McIlroy, led the field as he gunned for a second Open win. He followed up an opening round of 66 with a 69 and was 7-under 135. He held a two-shot lead over Brown and Rose (69-68).\n\nThe 2019 Open winner Lowry had five bogeys against a bogey and a double bogey on the 'infamous' 11th hole, also called 'Railway'. He fought back with birdies on the 16th and the 18th.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Open leader Shane Lowry gets off rails at 11 with lengthy, crazy double", "body": "Royal Troon's par-4 11th hole, nicknamed \"The Railway,\" has historically been one of the most difficult holes in the Open Championship rota.\n\nShane Lowry can now attest.\n\nLowry's second round, perhaps fittingly, got off the rails at No. 11 on Friday as Lowry saw his two-shot lead evaporate after a long and crazy sequence that involved a cameraman, a yanked shot into the gorse, a provisional that was later negated and ultimately, a double bogey.\n\nHere's how it all unfolded: Lowry's tee ball found the right fescue, and though it appeared that Lowry had a decent chance to muscle his second shot the 177 yards to the hole, his shot produced a large chunk of grass and a ball shooting out low and left and right into the left gorse.\n\nLowry was suddenly fuming, shouting at a cameraman who apparently distracted the leader.\n\n\"As I was over the ball, I could just see you with the f---ing camera up!\" Lowry told the cameraman. \"Just get back there! F---'s sake!\"\n\nWith his ball likely lost, Lowry reloaded and declared a provisional. That shot, his fourth at the time, ran up onto the green and about 20 feet past the hole. However, soon after a spectator found Lowry's original ball in the prickly stuff.\n\n\"He would've preferred not to have found that ball,\" NBC Sports analyst Paul McGinley said.\n\nWhat ensued was a lengthy process that included Lowry calling in a second rules official and even walking as far back as the adjacent 12th fairway as he sized up where he'd have to take his unplayable drop.\n\n\"You can declare a ball lost, but when it's actually found, it is the ball in play,\" R&A rules official Charlie Maran said. \"The provisional ball that he did play now becomes a wrong ball.

As he set up his second shot, a photographer stood in his line of sight.\n\n\"There was a cameraman there and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry recalled.\n\nNot only that, but the photographer apparently raised his camera in Lowry's backswing. The 2019 Open champ said the movement caused him to pull his approach left into a thick gorse bush.\n\n\"I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole,\" said Lowry.\" I drew a nice lie in the (right) rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\"\n\nThe bizarre ride through the Railway didn't end there.\n\nLowry's ball was deemed lost. He told the R&A officials he was hitting a provisional shot which he landed within 10 feet of the hole. Only moments later, a spectator found Lowry's original ball. The officials instantly negated his provisional shot, instead forcing him to take an unplayable lie.\n\n\"I hit a great provisional,\" Lowry said. \"The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was OK. Then we get down there and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then or you have to go and identify it. I thought if you declared it lost before it was found, you didn't have to go and identify it.\"\n\nBefore settling on a new spot, Lowry appealed to a second rules official -- a process that took about 20 minutes. He ended up dropping his ball in the rough about 10 feet from his original approach, chipped it to 33 feet, then two-putted for a double-bogey 6.\n\nAfterward, Lowry gave himself and his caddie, Darren Reynolds, credit for staying composed during the ordeal.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_corvo@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Michael Corvo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_and_Ancient_Golf_Club_of_St_Andrews", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Miniature", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Miniature", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains_and_Railroads/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Trains and Railroads/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Open-champioship-shane-lowry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

I holed a putt to go into the lead and I thought, 'It's the first time I've led The Open in five years!'.\n\n\"No matter what I do, that week in Portrush will always have a special place in my heart. I love that place and I love this tournament.\"\n\nThere were echoes of 2019 as McIlroy, who had been an emotional favourite at Portush but crashed after an opening 79, this time began with a seven-over 78, marked by his failure to deliver on the 'Postage Stamp' eighth hole when his attempt to escape the Coffin bunker rolled back deathlessly to his feet.\n\nMcIlroy, who blew his chance of a fifth major in last month's US Open showdown with DeChambeau, sounded as if he knew his chances were gone as he shrugged gloomily: \"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut.\"\n\nHe's not the only big name in trouble. DeChambeau shot a 76, though his 55ft eagle on the 16th could yet be crucial, but Australia's 2022 champion Cam Smith made 80 and has a mountain to climb.\n\nTiger Woods has his work cut out too after a tired-looking 79.\n\nThird-placed Thomas is a shot ahead of a seven-way logjam for fourth, featuring PGA champion Xander Schauffele , his US compatriot Russell Henley, Sweden's Alex Noren, Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard, Britain's former US Open champ Justin Rose, Canada's Mackenzie Hughes and England's Joe Dean, all on 69.\n\nUltimately, there were only 17 scores in the red by the end of the day, so Australia's evergreen veteran Adam Scott was also in a good spot, with a splash-in birdie from the greenside bunker at the first proving the launch pad for his one-under 70.\n\nThree birdies in the final four holes also helped another Australian early starter, Min Woo Lee, battle back to level par in his fighting round.\n\nDeChambeau had such a calamitous first nine he reckoned he could easily have walked away halfway through his round.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today. Shoot, man, I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home',\" he said.\n\nIn the afternoon wave, Schauffele, world No.1 Scottie Scheffler and Brooks Koepka (both one under) all flexed their muscles to remain firmly in the picture, but reigning champion Brian Harman had to settle earlier for a two-over 73.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Your whole game needs to be pretty good, especially when you're on a course like this.\n\n\"Royal Troon is probably one of the best lay-outs of a golf course you can get, it's just the most well bunkered golf course I've ever played and to win around a venue like this, you need to be very, very sharp and have to do everything pretty well.\"\n\nSunny conditions on Monday felt like a long time ago as the players acclimatised to a colder, grey day 24 hours later. The feeling on the course early in the week is that the front nine will be the place to make birdies - and that the back nine is entirely a different beast.\n\nLowry said that his game plan will be dependent on the conditions, but also that when the time is right he will play aggressively.\n\n\"I actually think a lot of it is dependent on the wind direction,\" the 37-year-old assessed. \"Today the wind is down on the front nine but the forecast is that we're going to play into the wind on the front nine, which doesn't allow you to be aggressive.\n\n\"If it's playing down wind you can drive a couple of the greens but it doesn't all that if it's into the wind, but obviously things can change on links turf and in links golf.\n\n\"My plan is that yes, if it plays downwind to play aggressive on the front nine and try to make as many birdies as I can because when you turn around on 10, this is where the golf course starts to get tough and you know all about it.\n\n\"I was here a couple of weeks ago and it was really windy and quite tough, it was very difficult.\n\n\"Like I said, it all depends on the wind direction. If you get the back nine a little bit downwind, it's actually not bad. So like every Open championship we play, every time you come here it's all very weather dependent.\"\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_scully@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Michael Scully", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrush", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portrush"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkered", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunkered"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article33258389.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Shane-Lowry-13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

It was on the treacherous par four where the Irishman snapped in four-lettered fury.\n\nThe 2019 champion hit his tee shot into the rough on this brutal driving hole with a train track on one side and thick gorse on the other, but when he tried to extricate himself from the cabbage his ball flew left into a bush.\n\nImmediately, Lowry swivelled and let the cameraman have it. \"As I was over the ball I could just see you putting your f------' camera up,\" Lowry said. \"Just get outta the way. Just get back there. F--- sake!\"\n\nLowry's contention was that the man moved in the middle of his backswing and was clearly incensed. But later the 37-year-old played down the incident. \"There was a cameraman there, and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there,\" Lowry said. \"As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it - my own fault.\"\n\nLowry believed he had \"done the hard part\" by putting his drive in play. As it proved, he was unlucky that his ball was found in the bush, because he had hit a provisional to 10 feet to give himself the opportunity to limit the damage to a bogey. But a spectator located the first ball, meaning it was still in play and after a 20-minute wait to ascertain where he could drop the ball, the best Lowry could escape with was a six.\n\nDavid Howell, the former Ryder Cup player who is working for Sky this week as an on-course commentator, revealed that the fan who found the ball was \"a little sheepish\" when he realised Lowry did not want that to happen. \"He's feeling awful,\" Howell said.\n\nNevertheless, Lowry birdied the 16th and 18th to claw back the shots and is pleased with how he reacted. \"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind where you get on with it better than other times,\" he said. \"This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with how things have gone. The job tomorrow is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.

The scale of fireworks on the final day of the Open at Royal Troon in 2016 left every onlooker grasping and gasping for superlatives. Henrik Stenson versus Phil Mickelson felt like golf's equivalent of the rumble in the jungle.\n\nBack in dreich Ayrshire - amid an infrequent wind and occasional squall - carnage ensued. The undeniable clubhouse leader after round one is the venue itself. It is for others to assess the entertainment value attached to that. Troon terrorised.\n\nTiger Woods's latest humbling came as no shock but there were eyebrows to be raised elsewhere. Rory McIlroy, 78. Bryson DeChambeau, 76. Tommy Fleetwood, 76. Ludvig \u00c5berg, 75. Cameron Smith played the front nine in 43 while en route to an 80. Collin Morikawa, Viktor Hovland, Patrick Cantlay and Hideki Matsuyama could not break par. Step forward the world No 272 Daniel Brown, who as darkness fell strode to the summit of the leaderboard. It was that sort of weird day.\n\nOn a par 71 course, the scoring average at one point touched 75. A 73 from Jon Rahm and Tyrrell Hatton's 72 felt decent in scoring context. Hatton did not come anywhere close to a rant or a rave yet did articulate what had made the environment such a grisly one.\n\n\"I don't think you can put it down to one thing, I think it's a combination,\" Hatton said. \"The conditions are difficult anyway. There's a few holes that are just obviously playing really long. Unfortunately that's where it's going at the moment, where they just seem to try to make it longer to make it harder, which I think doesn't make it the most enjoyable test.\n\n\"They didn't put any tees forward. You can't reach the par fives on the front nine [in two]. On 16, a par five, you're hitting a four iron. Tell me a good par five where you're hitting a four iron off the tee. There isn't one.\"\n\nSmith, who lifted the Claret Jug in 2022, was even more candid. \"It was brutal,\" said the Australian. The counter-argument would be that modern golfers should be able to handle the stern challenge.\n\nNobody read the script of torture to Shane Lowry. As other illustrious names licked their wounds, the 2019 champion charged - briefly, as it transpired - to the head of proceedings. Lowry did not drop a single shot during his opening round of 66. His putting was especially majestic until the final hole, when the Irishman arced a glorious iron from the middle of the fairway to just 5ft from the cup. \"I'm pretty happy, but it's only one day,\" Lowry cautioned. The last time he was sub-par at the end of Open Thursday, he won.\n\nMost surprising is the identity of the player who overtook Lowry. Brown had missed six cuts in his eight starts prior to arriving at this major. He laughed in the face of reputation while piecing together a bogey-free 65. Now for the hard part, of course, but he should relish the spotlight.\n\nJustin Thomas sits at minus three. Alex Noren, Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard, Mackenzie Hughes, Justin Rose, Russell Henley and Xander Schauffele are two under. Adam Scott and Brooks Koepka are among the contingent a stroke further back. So, too, is Scottie Scheffler after two birdies in his last three holes. Scheffler's presence will trigger anxious glances from the rest of the field.\n\nMcIlroy's troubles began at the Postage Stamp. Having taken a bolder line than was advisable towards the flag at the iconic par three, the Northern Irishman watched his ball trickle into a horrible lie in a greenside bunker. His first attempt from sand rolled back to his feet. By the time McIlroy tapped in, it was for a double bogey five.\n\nThere was further woe at the 11th. McIlroy cut his drive to the point where his ball was last reported rattling around a carriage of the 11.35 Scotrail service from Ayr to Glasgow Central. Cue another two shots dropped. By this point, McIlroy looked as though he would rather be undergoing root canal treatment than walking a links in Ayrshire.\n\nMcIlroy's demeanour upon signing for seven over par tally was more telling than what words fell from his mouth. He was asked if past recoveries meant he retains hopes of glory. Writ large upon his face was: NO. McIlroy's Friday battle here involves survival for the closing 36 holes.\n\nDeChambeau, who pipped McIlroy to the US Open last month, was in an identical predicament before holing out from a different postcode for an eagle at the 16th. DeChambeau is yet to handle the vagaries associated with British seaside golf, which to be fair he readily admits.\n\n\"It's a difficult test,\" DeChambeau said. \"Something I'm not familiar with. I never grew up playing it. I finished eighth at St Andrews; I can do it when it's warm and not windy.\n\n\"I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home.' But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\"\n\nWoods limped and laboured his way to a 79.

And since that major he has finished second, seventh and fourth at the Rocket Mortgage Classic, the John Deere Classic and the Genesis Scottish Open respectively.\n\nMansell, from Burntwood, is not coming into the tournament on such good form - though he did equal the course record of 61 at The Renaissance Club on his way to qualifying for The Open at the Scottish Open last week.\n\nHe is two shots back from Rai on four-under after becoming one of several players - including Rory McIlroy - to fall foul of the eight hole, known as The Postage Stamp.\n\nThe 29-year-old, who had just birdied the seventh, found the bunker off the tee and then needed two goes to get out of it before finally managing to navigate the tricky par-three in a double-bogey five.\n\nThree more bogeys - at the fourth, 15th and 17th - left him on four-over ahead of an early start to his second round at 6.57am this morning.\n\nWhile Lowry, Thomas and Englishman Brown enjoyed their day, some big names were well off the pace - including Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau. McIlroy, who agonisingly missed out on an overdue fifth major title in last month's US Open, added: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and made a double.\n\n\"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine, thinking that I could maybe get those couple of shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\n\"Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice.

Lowry hit a good tee shot, but was distracted by a cameraman as he went to take his second, which went left, flying over the gallery and into a gorse bush.\n\nThe 37-year-old was fuming with the outcome and could be heard saying to the cameraman: \"As I was over the ball I could just see you putting your f***ing camera up. Just get out of the way. Just get back there. F*** sake.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Shane Lowry backed to last distance at The Open but Offaly man not getting carried away\n\nREAD MORE: Who is Dan Brown? Meet the unlikely Open leader after day one\n\nLowry took a drop shot after his ball went into the gorse, but a spectator then found his original ball, meaning it was still in play and it took some time to determine he could best take a drop. His shot then just shot of the green as he went on to get double-bogey six.\n\nSpeaking on the incident after completing his round, Lowry said: \"I did the hard part. I hit my drive where you could find it, which is obviously a hard thing to do on that hole. I did a nice lie in the rough. I got a little bit distracted on the right just as I was over the shot, and I kind of lost a bit of train of thought. You're so afraid of going right there that I just snagged the club and went left.\n\n\"Then from there, I hit a great provisional. The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was okay. Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes, it was whatever it was, of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing, and I felt like Darren did a great job too just kind of -- he kept telling me, we have loads of time. We don't need to rush this. We just need to do the right thing here.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a 6. It was not like -- it wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\n\n\"I think the 12th hole for me was key. 12 was playing very difficult, straight into the wind. I hit driver, 4-iron there too, the best shots I've hit all week, to about 30 feet and made par there. From then on, I felt like down out of the left coming in, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nHe added on the cameraman: \"Just there was a cameraman there, and he was walking up, and I asked him to stop or move back, and he just kind of stayed there. As it was over, he put his camera up. I kind of saw it out of the corner of my eye, and I should stood off it, my own fault.\"\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_hynes@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Robert Hynes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Camera operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offaly_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offaly GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fault (geology)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article33283900.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2162654943.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

as Tiger Woods looks set to miss the cut at Royal Troon on Friday.\n\nWoods is not the only big name to struggle in the blustery conditions on Scotland's west coast as Rory McIlroy will begin his second round at seven over and likely needing an under par round to make the weekend.\n\nLowry had been usurped at the top of the leaderboard late on Thursday by unheralded Englishman Daniel Brown, who posted a six under 65.\n\nHowever, the Irishman, who won his sole major at the British Open in 2019, picked up birdies on the first, fifth and eighth to make the turn with a two-shot lead.\n\nBrown, the world number 272, remains Lowry's closest challenger but dropped back to five under after five.\n\nWoods was adamant earlier in the week that he is not considering retirement and feels physically better than 12 months ago.\n\nBut the 15-time major champion cut a sorry figure as he trudged around the Troon links, dropping three shots on the front nine to slide to 11 over par for the tournament.\n\nWith the projected cut at four over, Woods, 48, seems certain to fail to complete four rounds for the sixth time in eight majors since a car accident in 2021 left him with severe leg injuries.\n\nStrong winds ensured low scoring remained difficult with the sixth, which had been the longest hole in British Open history on Thursday at 623 yards, reduced by 20 yards due to the conditions.\n\nWorld number three Xander Schauffele recovered from a difficult start to make the turn at two under.\n\nThe recently crowned USPGA Championship winner had dropped back to even par before back-to-back biridies at the seventh and eighth.\n\nWorld number one Scottie Scheffler is also lurking at one under after a level par front nine.\n\nAttention later turns to McIlroy's attempt to recover from a disastrous opening round of 78.\n\nThe Northern Irishman's chances of ending a decade-long drought to win a major already appear gone.\n\nBut the world number two has only failed to make the cut once in his last 14 majors.\n\nUS Open champion Bryson DeChambeau also has work to do to hang around for the weekend as he begins his second round at five over.\n\nTwo-time major winner Justin Thomas is well poised to make a push for the final group on Saturday as he starts at three under.\n\nkca/jc\n\nMore from this section\n\nNational Nonprofit Petco Love Invests in Sacramento SPCA

A few pints of Tennent's were had out there, I'd say.\n\n\"They were quite excitable out there, and it felt more like the weekend. I just kept on telling myself there's a lot more to do and there's a few days left, so I just kind of stayed in my lane and hit some good shots, and I was pretty happy with how I handled myself.\"\n\nLowry finished with a birdie on 18, his fifth of the day. \"The walk down 18 was actually pretty cool,\" he added. \"I said to (Matt Fitzpatrick's caddie) Billy Foster, we walked down beside each other, that it's the greatest walk in golf, and I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house, and that's the plan, to try to get to do that again.\n\n\"I'd give anything to give myself a chance to win this tournament again, and that's why I'm here this week.

Brown, who overtook Shane Lowry with a late birdie to grab a one-shot lead, is playing in his first ever major championship this week. He's the highest-ranked golfer to lead a major after the opening round since 2016, too.\n\nLowry, who also carded a bogey-free 66, is in a great position to make a run by the midway point of the tournament. He picked up his first major championship win at Royal Portrush in 2019. Justin Thomas will start Friday alone in third at 3-under, and a group of seven golfers are tied at 2-under.\n\nAfter their wild battle in North Carolina, neither Bryson DeChambeau nor Rory McIlroy started their week in Scotland well. DeChambeau opened with a 5-over 76, and McIlroy finished with a 7-over 78. They're both going to have to make a run on Friday in order to make the cut, something McIlroy hasn't missed at the British Open since 2019.\n\nTiger Woods, like he has so many times in recent years, struggled again too. Woods posted an 8-over 79 on Thursday, which is likely to lead to his seventh missed cut or withdrawal in his last 10 major championship starts.\n\nFor full tee times for the first two rounds of the tournament, click here.\n\nKeep up with Yahoo Sports for full live coverage of the British Open below:", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Portrush_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Portrush Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Squash/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OQ5MtLd60EsGgXPW7GnSTw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-07/39f3fdd0-454b-11ef-bf8f-4da75882d73c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Every time you looked at Shane Lowry on the driving range he was shooting the breeze between shots. Laughing. Smiling. For all the world a man comfortable in his own skin. And why not? For the first time this year he's playing on the European side of the Atlantic, having prepped for this 152nd Open Championship - and a tilt for a second Claret Jug - his own way.\n\nLowry opted to skip last week's Genesis Scottish Open and instead headed to Hogs Head in Co Kerry where he and some friends had the run of the links course. \"It was quiet. It was like 15 mile an hour wind. It was perfect. Exactly what I needed,\" said Lowry, who had already made an advance reconnaissance visit to Troon to get the lay of the land.\n\nThese are his kind of weeks, where Majors get the competitive juices flowing and where pressure adds its own extra ingredient to the mix. \"You drive in here and you see the Claret Jug when you are registering and the history with it and the golf course and the magnitude of it is just big. I think it is the biggest tournament in the world.\n\n\"You get a little bit uptight in weeks like this, and I try and stay as cool and as calm as I can, but ultimately I want to play the best golf I can this week. At certain stages throughout the week, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, there are times when you are anxious and a little bit nervy about things. But once I get on to the first tee on Thursday and hit my tee shot I am sure I will be okay and I will go out and do my best,\" said Lowry.\n\nFor sure he's glad to have the taste of sea salt in the air. To have the wind blow. To have the nuances of links and its array of bounces.\n\nLowry has enjoyed a great season so far on the PGA Tour, where he is currently 13th on the FedEx Cup standings, which has included a win (in tandem with Rory McIlroy in the Zurich Classic) and four other top-10 finishes, including a tied-sixth place in the US PGA.\n\n\"I am pretty happy at where my game is at and pretty happy with what I have been doing this season. Obviously it doesn't matter what has happened over the last six months, it is all about this week now, and for me it is about going out there. Hopefully I can go into Thursday feeling good about myself and give it a good run.\n\n\"I think golf is a funny game, isn't it? In the last two months I have shot two 62s and an 85, and it is like it is just funny. You never take anything for granted, the good times don't last forever and the bad times don't last forever. You just have to get on with it when you can and ride the wave when you are playing well.\"\n\nLowry has a late/early tee-time slot for the opening two rounds when another former champion Cameron Smith and former US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick will be his partners in crime in going about their respective bids for glory.\n\nAnd the move back to this side of the pond, and the slower greens compared to the USA, hasn't required any remedial action. For instance, Tiger Woods has added lead to his putter to help. Not Lowry. Maybe it's the new putter. Maybe it's the extra few weeks he's had to acclimatise.\n\n\"I feel like I have turned a corner on the greens since even the Zurich Classic. Even though we won I didn't feel overly comfortable that week. The week after that I felt like I turned a corner on the greens and I'm feeling pretty confident with the flat stick. I always say when I come to these tournaments that if I hole some putts I can be dangerous. So fingers crossed.\"\n\nFive years on from his win at Royal Portrush, Lowry - now 37 - has even used those extra digits as a positive. \"I remember saying that to P\u00e1draig [Harrington] at the start of the year and he said when he was 37 he had one of his best years.

His best hope now is getting beyond one more day.\n\nAnd he has company from U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nThe protagonists from Pinehurst No. 2 were no match for a wind that came out of the opposite direction at Royal Troon and caused both of them more problems than they wanted Thursday.\n\nMcIlroy took two shots to get out of a deep bunker right of the \"Postage Stamp,\" the famous nickname of the 123-yard eighth hole. Three holes later, he hammered driver that sailed over the railroad tracks and out-of-bounds.\n\nIt added to a 7-over 78, his worst start to major in five years.\n\n\"The conditions were tough on that back nine, and I just didn't do a good enough job,\" he said.\n\nPHOTOS: McIlroy, DeChambeau stumble badly out of the gates at British Open\n\nDeChambeau wasn't much better. He couldn't buy a par putt early on, even missing from 3 feet on the par-5 fourth. He tried to hit 7-iron out of the thick grass and moved it only a few feet, leading to a double bogey on the par-5 seventh.\n\nHe wound up with a 76 and was headed to the range to figure out his equipment and why his golf ball didn't leave the club the way he expected.\n\n\"It was a weird day,\" he said.\n\nThey were part of the morning wave and the star attraction coming off a U.S. Open that neither is likely to forget. McIlroy had a two-shot lead on the back nine and still in control of his fate until missing a 30-inch par putt on the 16th hole, and then a par putt from just inside 4 feet on the 18th hole that extended his decade-long drought in the majors.\n\nDeChambeau captured his second U.S. Open by getting up-and-down from 55 yards away in a bunker. The finish was so hard for McIlroy that he bolted from Pinehurst No. 2 without speaking or sticking around to congratulate DeChambeau.\n\nMcIlroy played last week in the Scottish Open and tied for fourth, and was optimistic about his form going into the final major of the year. But he and everyone else was thrown off their plans when the wind came from an opposite direction.\n\nIt was into their faces on the shorter front nine - where good scores are to be had - and helping from the left on the longer back nine, which isn't easy in any conditions.\n\n\"I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did,\" McIlroy said. \"The course was playing tough. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\"\n\nMcIlroy said he had a strategy based on the wind from the practice rounds.\n\n\"But then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice,\" he said. \"Just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nThe round didn't end well. McIlroy chose to hit driver off the 18th and found a pot bunker to the left that left him no choice but to blast out sideways. He hit wedge to about 8 feet and missed one last putt, making one last bogey, leaving a that much more work ahead.\n\n\"I have to do a better job in those conditions, and I need to go out there and play better and try to shoot something under par and at least be here for the weekend, if not try to put myself up the leaderboard a bit more more and feel like I have half a chance,\" he said.\n\nMcIlroy was 10 shots out of the lead when he finished, hopeful it wouldn't be more.\n\nDeChambeau was more of a slow bleed, going out in 42 and not registering a hole under par until he reached the par-5 16th. That was the one happy spot of the day. He easily reached the green on the 565-yard hole and made a 55-foot eagle putt.\n\n\"I'm just proud of the way I persevered today,\" DeChambeau said. \"Shoot, man, I could have thrown in the towel after nine and could have been like, 'I'm going home.' But no, I've got a chance tomorrow. I'm excited for the challenge.\n\n\"If I have some putts go in and hit some shots the way I know how to and figure out this equipment stuff, I'll be good.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Doug Ferguson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf ball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/07/18/British_Open_Golf_41449_c0-118-2826-1765_s1770x1032.jpg?c62d0c327591df466f3acb9f278a58b87466061d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nA drastic wind change from the practice rounds and regular bursts of rain, in conjunction with the thickest of thistle and gorse on the coastal course, and along with trains and planes as well, to render scoring difficult throughout a challenging opening day.\n\n\"It's just a bad day, really. I mean, if you had told me yesterday that I was going to shoot that, I wouldn't have said that was possible,\" he said.\n\n\"But (it was) just a bit of a crappy start and didn't really manage to hold any putts when I needed to, to kind of get back in it. It's just a bad day and I had some bad breaks as well.\"\n\nRubbing salt into the rawest of wounds for Smith, who turned in 43 and ballooned to 10-over twice on the back nine, is that his playing partner Shane Lowry shot a superb five-under 66 when revelling in the cross-winds.\n\nFellow partner Matt Fitzpatrick was among the 17 players including Adam Scott and world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who both shot 1-under, to finish under par as Troon put stars including multiple major winners including Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and Ernie Els to the sword.\n\nAfter finishing sixth in a LIV Tour event last week, Smith said he felt quietly confident on Wednesday.\n\nBut with the wind whipping to 40km/h in wintry conditions, the 30-year-old pulled an iron with his second shot of the day to the left of the opening green in an over-par start.\n\nWhen his arm shot right on the second tee - while Lowry and Fitzpatrick went left, Smith's ball cut towards the Firth of Clyde despite the direction of the heavy gale - to indicate a wayward drive to the crowds standing near the beach, the alarm bells were ringing.\n\nA triple-bogey eventuated, but the former world No. 2s day only worsened in an erratic display that left him looking bewildered as his hopes of contending again were dashed by a round where he also scored nine bogies, just five pars and three birdies.\n\n\"If you ask Shaneo, it is probably a different story, but no, it's hard, mate,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a lot of crosswinds and it was hard to keep the ball on the fairway and then, when you landed in the rough, you (are) kind of guessing when you land something short with the bounces you are going to get, so yeah, it was brutal.\n\n\"It really was a good test of golf and you needed to be on your A-plus game to be under par and I witnessed it.\"\n\nScott enjoyed the most favourable conditions early in the day, but even the morning test was particularly tricky, with a heavy burst or rain that struck Royal Troon shortly after 7pm signalling a brief summer reprieve in Scotland was over, at least for now.\n\nA small portion of hardy souls in the crowd wore shorts, no doubt hoping the mild conditions from earlier in the week would hold after the day broke looking reasonably bright.\n\nOn Wednesday evening the hills on the Isle of Arran proved eye-catching but by mid-morning they were shrouded in cloud, though the weather cleared slightly towards 6pm.\n\nBut by the time Min Woo Lee, who broke even with the card after a late flurry of birdies, teed off, the ripples in the nearby Firth of Clyde were rolling in flatter and faster, with some fury.\n\nScott, 44, is one of three Australians within range of Lowry alongside Lee, who rallied late with three birdies in the final four holes to square the card, and Jason Day, who battled well in the afternoon wind to finish at +2.\n\n\"To be honest, I feel like it's to be expected at The Open. I feel it can be unpredictable,\" Scott said.\n\n\"Even teeing off in a fairly strong wind on the first, I still felt like that might be the best conditions of the day, so I should take advantage of it.\"\n\nMcIlroy started to unravel when missing the green at The Postage Stamp, where he shot a double-bogey, before scoring another one when he hit out of bounds on the 11th.\n\nA seven-over 78 was his worst score in a major in five years and follows the disappointment of the US Open, where he missed short putts on the 70th and 72nd holes to finish second.\n\n\"Your misses get punished a lot more this week than even last week or even, geez, any weeks, whether you miss it in a fairway bunker or even the rough,\" McIlroy said.\n\n\"The rough, the balls that I hit in the rough today, the lies were pretty nasty. I think it's more you just get penalised more for your misses.\"\n\nIt was a theme shared by all those who failed to adapt to a change in wind from recent practice days, with many unable to adapt to the different clubs and shots required.\n\nWoods, for example, started brightly with a brilliant birdie on the 3rd but ended at 8-over and lamented he \"didn't do a whole lot right\".\n\nA runner-up last week in Scotland, Scott was pleased with his swing but said the altered conditions along with slower than anticipated greens made Troon taxing.\n\n\"I think we're all a little timid with our putting. The greens are so much slower than we're used to, and it's a major,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't want to start racing putts by, but it's hard to even get it to the hole. I think today is about finding your feel for the week and maybe (there will be) better scoring after this.\"\n\nOthers were less enthusiastic. Recent US Open champion Bryson de Chambeau boosted his hopes of making the cut when eagling the par 5 16th hole, but still scored 5-over.\n\n\"It's a completely different test. I didn't get any practice in it and I didn't really play much in the rain,\" he said.\n\n\"(It's) something I'm not familiar with. I never grew up playing in it and, (this is) not to say that that's the reason - I finished eighth at St Andrews - but I can do it when it's warm and not windy.\"\n\nDefending champion Brian Harman described the day as \"tough, really tough\" after finishing alongside Tyrell Hatton, who lamented that his \"ball striking day was pretty awful\", at 2-over.\n\n\"It was not a fun experience,\" Hatton said.\n\nAustralian debutants Elvis Smylie, who finished at 5-over, and amateur Jasper Stubbs, who shot 9-over 80, also found the going tough, though both rallied late in their rounds.",

He managed to drain a decent putt on the 18th for birdie, one of three for the day, to avoid a personal record.\n\n\"It's just a bad day, really,\" he said.\n\n\"I mean, if you had told me yesterday that I was going to shoot that, I wouldn't have said that was possible. But (it was) just a bit of a crappy start and didn't really manage to hold any putts when I needed to, to kind of get back in it. It's just a bad day and I had some bad breaks as well.\"\n\nThe 30-year-old turned in a seven-over 43 and while the weather settled to a degree after 6pm on a day where play began 12 hours earlier, Smith was unable to rally as he plummeted out of contention, with his score ballooning to 10-over after 15 holes.\n\nRubbing salt into Smith's wounds is that playing partner Shane Lowry leads the field at 5-under after playing superbly despite the tricky conditions.\n\nFellow playing partner Matt Fitzpatrick was also among the handful of golfers including Australian Adam Scott to finish under par.\n\n\"If you ask Shaneo, it is probably a different story, but no, it's hard, mate,\" he said.\n\n\"There was a lot of crosswinds and it was hard to keep the ball on the fairway and then, when you landed in the rough, it's kind of you kind of guessing when you land something short with the bounces you are going to get, so yeah, it was brutal.\n\n\"It really was a good test of golf and you needed to be on your A-plus game to be under par and I witnessed it.\"\n\nWatch every round of The Open LIVE & Exclusive to Fox Sports, available on Kayo.

Start Your Free Trial Today >\n\nThe weather has played havoc, with only 15 players under par at 7.20pm as Smith came up the 16th hole, having recorded eight bogeys to go with his nightmare on the second, along with a birdie in which he rattled in a 40-foot putt on the 3rd hole, and five pars.\n\nAustralia's other leading contenders are far better positioned, headed by veteran Adam Scott, who providing an early highlight when chipping in from the bunker on the opening hole on the way to shooting a solid 1-under.\n\nScott wasn't happy with his second shot, which found one of the several bunkers on 1, but made up for it with a classy chip from the deep trap, which rolled into the hole.\n\nCompatriot Min Woo Lee is one shot back at even par, with two late birdies rocketing him back into contention after a slow start as competitors came to grips with a U-turn in the direction the wind is blowing from practice rounds earlier this week.\n\nJason Day battled well in the trickiest conditions to record of 2-over, which positions him in a tie for 48th, but other big names including Rory McIlroy (+7), Bryson deChambeau (+5) and veteran Ernie Els (+11) also endured nightmare opening days.\n\nAustralia's amateur entrant Jasper Stubbs endured a difficult debut in the British Open when shooting 9-over, but was far stronger on the back nine and finished the round with a birdie to provide him with some optimism heading into the second round.\n\nElvis Smylie rallied late with three birdies from his final four holes to record 5-over.\n\nAmerican Justin Thomas shares the lead with Ireland's Shane Lowry at 3-under late on the first day with Troon truly showing its teeth in tricky conditions.\n\n\"It was pretty solid,\" Scott said.\n\n\" I think the wind change ... made the back nine play tougher, even though it was down wind, (because) I hadn't really played in that wind and I made a couple of errors. But it was fairly uneventful day, so I've played solid and pretty happy to start off under par.\"\n\nWhile the back nine is traditionally more testing than the front at Troon, which is often described as a tale of two courses, the change in wind assisted golfers in handling some of the more testing par 4s.\n\nBut that did not mean it was less tricky, with Scott over-clubbing on 16 as a result.\n\n\"On these holes ... the last time I played it was 2-irons and 3-irons into every hole (whereas) today it was a sand wedge into 15,\" he said. \"Trying to figure that out, it was a bit like a practice run back nine today. I made an error on 16, got one too much off the tee and it cost me a bogie, but other than that everything was good.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old, who finished runner-up in the Scottish Open last week, feels in better control of his game than he has in years and is hopeful of being in contention at Troon on the weekend.\n\n\"It'd be great because my game is finally in some decent shape where I feel like I'm controlling the ball well,\" he said.\n\n\"(That is something) you need to do out here, especially if you're going to give yourself a lot of chances. It's sometimes easy to scrap it around the links, but you're not going to hold a lot of 40 foot (putts).\n\n\"So at some point, you're going to need to hit some really quality iron shots from the fairway to get in close to some tough pins and give yourself more realistic chances. They are the guys who are going to be up there at the end of the week.\"\n\nLee started slowly with consecutive bogeys on the second and third holes and double-bogeyed the 11th but played the last four holes in 3-under to finish square with the card.\n\nHe struggled early with the tempo of the greens, saying it felt like he was \"smashing the putt but coming up short\".\n\n\"It was amazing. My caddie and I knew that it was going to be a tough day and, especially, the back nine is really tough,\" he said.\n\n\"I made a quick double ... but, you know, it was just one of those things where you know it is one of the hardest holes on (the) course. (But) I managed to hit a lot of good shots on the back nine over the last four or five or six holes and I was converting them.\n\n\"I was getting close. I feel like the putts that I've just missed, I read well, but just left it shorter, so I just needed to hit a harder and they went in.\"\n\nStubbs, meanwhile, was relieved to finish with a birdie on the 18th after a testing start in which he put his opening tee shot out of bounds when pushing it towards the Firth of Clyde on route to shooting a 9-over the card.\n\n\"I finished quite nicely ... but, yeah, I just got off to an annoying start to say the least,\" he told foxsports.com.au\n\n\"It is not a good sign when you hit one OOB off the first, but it is what it is and I moved on.

The wind changed direction at Royal Troon and seemed to fool everyone except Shane Lowry. He played the links a few weeks ago and knew how to handle the wind from the opposite direction. Lowry had a 66 for his best start ever in a major. And then came Brown, a 29-year-old from England. Playing in the second-to-last group, he birdied two of the last three holes for a 65 to lead in his major championship debut. Tiger Woods had a 79. Rory McIlroy shot 78.\n\nClippers trade Russell Westbrook to Jazz. He's expected to join the Nuggets after a buyout\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Clippers have sent Russell Westbrook to the Utah Jazz in a sign-and-trade deal for point guard Kris Dunn. ESPN reports that the Jazz are expected to buy out the former NBA MVP's contract so Westbrook can sign with the Denver Nuggets. Utah also got the right to swap second-round draft picks in 2030, the draft rights to center Balsa Koprivica and cash. Westbrook is a nine-time All-Star and the 2017 MVP with Oklahoma City. He was traded for the fifth time in his career.\n\nTiger Woods in danger of missing cut at British Open again after 8-over 79 at Royal Troon\n\nTROON, Scotland (AP) -- Tiger Woods had another disappointing round at a major championship. Woods' 8-over 79 on Thursday at Royal Troon left him in danger of missing the cut for a third straight time at the British Open. Woods says \"I need to shoot something in the mid-60s tomorrow to get something going on the weekend.\" Woods now has 14 consecutive rounds in the majors without breaking par dating to a 69 in the second round of the 2022 PGA Championship. It's his highest score to start a major since an 80 in the 2015 U.S. Open at Chambers Bay.\n\nMcIlroy, DeChambeau stumble badly out of the gates at British Open\n\nTROON, Scotland (AP) -- Rory McIlroy and Bryson DeChambeau were the protagonists from Pinehurst No. 2. They were also-rans at Royal Troon. McIlroy was hopeful of giving himself one last chance at a major in the British Open. Instead he shot a 78 for his worst start to the Open in five years. He says he didn't adjust to a different wind. DeChambeau couldn't make par putts and couldn't move a golf ball more than a few feet on one shot from the rough. He shot 42 on the front nine and rallied for a 76. Now they hope to just make the cut.\n\nAaron Rodgers and Russell Wilson are among several NFL stars with something to prove this season\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- Aaron Rodgers knows all eyes are on him. That's nothing new for the four-time NFL MVP. The 40-year-old New York Jets quarterback enters his 20th season with plenty to prove after missing all but four snaps last year because of a torn Achilles tendon. He certainly isn't alone in the spotlight as training camps open. Pittsburgh's Russell Wilson, San Francisco's Christian McCaffrey, Cleveland's Deshaun Watson, Jacksonville's Trevor Lawrence and Philadelphia's Saquon Barkley are among a handful out to prove themselves either because of injuries, mediocre play or needing to justify big contracts.\n\nNew York Mets 1B Pete Alonso among MLB stars who could use big second half heading into free agency\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Pete Alonso's disappointing performance in this year's Home Run Derby wasn't a particularly big deal for the future of his big-league career. His play over the next three months could be a different story. The 29-year-old is one of the most coveted free agents in Major League Baseball for the upcoming offseason and could make himself a lot of money -- or potentially lose a lot of it -- depending on how he plays in the second half of the season. Others who could use a good second half before hitting free agency including Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt and Astros third baseman Alex Bregman.\n\nHutsby goes from working in a pro shop to a dream start in British Open\n\nTROON, Scotland (AP) -- Sam Hutsby felt he was dreaming when his name was announced on the first tee at the British Open. He was working in a golf shop just a few years ago when he thought it was worth one more try at tournament golf. He qualified for Royal Troon and was briefly leading after just eight holes until posting a 74. Henrik Stenson played the Postage Stamp par 3 in even par when he won at Troon in 2016. In the opening round, he took a triple bogey. The real rough start belonged to Cameron Smith. He shot an 80.\n\nRebranding the brand man, softer Trump vs. fighter Trump, regular mentions of Harris: RNC Takeaways\n\nMILWAUKEE (AP) -- Republicans are wrapping a nominating convention that has celebrated former President Donald Trump not just as a party leader but a living martyr who survived a would-be assassin's bullet and is ready to work for everyday Americans after a sweeping victory in November. Trump's campaign has worked hard to soften Trump's image over the course of the four-day convention. But that also mixed Thursday with figures from the professional wrestling and fighting world. There's plenty of campaigning left, so effectiveness of the sometimes contradictory messaging effort remains to be seen. Still, it's been a striking four days for a Republican Party that over three presidential elections has been reshaped by Trump's personality and his politics.\n\nTexas A&M not as noisy, which is good for the Aggies since Mike Elko replaced Jimbo Fisher\n\nDALLAS (AP) -- There is already a much different feel around Texas A&M with new coach Mike Elko. The focus is back on football, without all of the noise that surrounded the program last year. Elko was hired away from Duke after Texas A&M paid $75 million to fire Jimbo Fisher and bring some stability to the program. Elko said when he was hired that it was time for the Aggies to do the work and start to fulfill their potential. Ther former defensive coordinator says that's what they have done the past seven months, and that he is proud of how quiet the offseason has been.\n\nCaitlin Clark is looking forward to some time off after a record-setting night\n\nARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Caitlin Clark is savoring the thought of some time off even though the Indiana star wanted to go to the Olympics. Clark didn't look like she needed a break while setting a WNBA record with 19 assists in a game in the Fever's finale before the stoppage heading into the Paris Games. Clark's milestone came in a 101-93 loss to the Dallas Wings. It's not quite time for Clark to take a breather. She's playing for the WNBA All-Stars against the U.S. women's Olympic team in Phoenix this weekend. Indiana's season resumes Aug. 16 against Phoenix.", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News-Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@news-gazette.com",

That ended his hopes at a fourth British Open title, for the 15-time major championship winner in recent years.\n\nWoods is now done competing until at least the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas in December. His next official PGA Tour event likely won't be until the Genesis Invitational in February.\n\nThough Woods was the biggest name to miss the cut, plenty of others aren't seeing the weekend. The cutline was at 6-over after Shane Lowry took a two-shot lead over the field ahead of a windy afternoon that seemed to shut just about everybody down.\n\nWyndham Clark, who won the U.S. Open last year and earned a spot in the Olympics later this summer, finished behind Woods at 16-over after . He completely whiffed with his ball in the high grass, and his ball went just a few feet in front of him.\n\nLudvig \u00c5berg, who finished in second at the Masters in April and T4 last week, dropped to 9-over on Friday to miss the cut. He went 6-over on a five-hole stretch on his front nine on Friday before closing with a 5-over 76. Will Zalatoris was right with him, too, and finished at 8-over on the week. Tommy Fleetwood, Viktor Hovland and Tony Finau are also headed home early. While it looked as if Max Homa was going to miss the cut, he drained a 30-footer for birdie at the last in order to sneak in. That prompted a massive celebration on the green.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprises, however, are with Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy. The duo, after their thrilling battle at the U.S. Open in North Carolina last month, both missed the cut after a brutal two days in Scotland.\n\nMcIlroy, who opened with a 7-over 78 on Thursday, went 6-over through his first six holes on Friday -- thanks largely to a triple bogey at the par-5 4th. He finished at 11-over in what was the second-highest 36-hole score at a major championship in his career. McIlroy has now gone a full decade without winning a major, too.\n\nDeChambeau, after a slightly-better 5-over 76 on Thursday, struggled to recover in his second round. He made the turn at 1-over on the day, and then made three bogeys on his back nine en route to a 4-over 75.

The Englishman two behind Lowry and right in the mix entering the weekend.\n\nDustin Johnson: Critics look at the nonchalant demeanor and recent majors results (missed cuts in three of the last four) and think DJ is mailing it in at age 40, but a Friday 69 showed plenty of heart and game. He's in the picture for the weekend at 1 over and will be back next year with a top-10 finish-important considering this is his last exempt Open from his 2020 Masters win.\n\nJustin Rose: The former U.S. Open champ earned his spot in this field via a 36-hole qualifier, and he's making the most of it: his long birdie at 18 was a highlight-reel moment to cap a 68 and a tie for second place with Brown entering the weekend.\n\nhttps://x.com/TheOpen/status/1814353864059170834\n\nScottie Scheffler: Signed for a 1-under 70 during the calmer weather on Friday morning, and there he is again: 2 under for the tournament, five shots back, the very definition of lurking. Expect everyone currently listed above his name on the yellow boards to keep one eye on him this weekend.\n\nLosers\n\nTiger Woods: Expectations were already low to start the week, but seeing Woods hobble and bobble around Troon to rounds of 79 and 77 was at times difficult to watch. Bob Harig took a deep dive on what's next for Woods. Here's hoping for a sharper and healthier version of the GOAT in 2025.\n\nLudvig Aberg: One staffer in this establishment liked the Swede to get his first major win this week, instead he won't even see the weekend.\n\nRory McIlroy: If he wanted to show the world he was physically and emotionally recovered from one of the all-time major-championship collapses, this missed cut was not the way.

I feel like when you've tasted success, you just want it even more.\n\n\"That's just the way it is. I feel like I wanted so bad to win another one. Just give me one more and I'll be happy,\" he laughed.\n\n\"That's all I want. Is it too much to ask for?\"\n\nThe hugely popular PGA Tour star went on to admit that he feels primed for another major after some low key preparation for the 156th Open.\n\nHe added: \"I know my name is on it [The Claret Jug], the fact that I've been there - won it and done it - it makes me want it even more, to do it again.\"\n\nThe world number 31 is confident as he mapped out his preparation for this years' final major after he surprisingly missed the cut during last year's Open at Royal Liverpool.\n\nLowry decided to skip last week's Genesis Scottish Open in favour of some more detailed prep.\n\nInstead he headed to Hogs Head in Waterville, Kerry as he put the final touches on his skill-set ahead of his trip to Scotland.\n\nThe wind was up to a perfect 15km on the stunning links, unlike the relatively benign conditions at The Renaissance Club.\n\nClara ace Lowry is amongst the favourites to win the title at 33/1 after finding solid form of the PGA Tour this season.\n\nHis FedEx Cup standing is the best in his career at this stage in the season heading into the playoffs.\n\nLowry has five top-10s this season and one win at The Zurich Classic with Rory McIlroy as he lie 12th on the points ladder.\n\nThe Irishman has a busy summer schedule with the Olympic Games golf tournament also on the radar at La Golf National in August.\n\nAll the action is

Round 1 gave us everything we could have hoped for from a spectators perspective. From fairway hole outs and lengthy eagle to first hole out of bounds and double and triple bogeys. Daniel Brown was the surprise leader by day's end. The Briton shot an impressive 65 to reach the summit at -6. 2019 Champion Golfer of The Year Shane Lowry is close behind, after bogeying the last to shoot 66. Justin Thomas had an up and down day, at one point carding a double bogey, but eventually shooting 68, keeping him in third place and in good shape going into his second round.\n\nIn true Open fashion, conditions yesterday were unpredictable with most of the scoring done on the back nine even though most predicted the high scoring to be done on the front nine prior to the opening round. Some big names flattered to deceive too, Rory McIlroy, the big hope after his US Open meltdown in June, shot a paltry 78, all but putting him out of contention. Former champions Tiger Woods and Cameron Smith both failed to get to grips with the course; Woods shooting 79 and Smith carding a disappointing 80. Is there a way back for US Open victor Bryson DeChambeau? The big hitter was +5 thorugh his opening 6 holes at one point but managed to steady the ship and go even par for his last 12 holes. Will it be enough to keep him in the field for the weekend though?

The referee asked me going down, did I want to find my first one, and I said no. So I assumed that was okay.\n\n\"Then we get down there, and somebody had found it. So apparently we have to find it then, or you have to go and identify it, which I thought, if you declared it lost before it was found, that you didn't, you didn't have to go and identify it.\n\n\"I felt like through that whole process of that 20 minutes, it was whatever it was, of taking the drop, seeing where I could drop, and I felt like I was very calm and composed and really knew that I was doing the right thing.\n\n\"And I felt like (my caddie) Darren (Reynolds) did a great job too; he kept telling me, 'we have loads of time; we don't need to rush this; we just need to do the right thing here'.\n\n\"To be honest, I was happy enough leaving there with a six. It wasn't a disaster. I was still leading the tournament.\"\n\nA six at the 11th might have derailed a less resilient player but Lowry was superb from there and followed four pars with birdies at the 16th and 18th to put himself in a commanding position at halfway.\n\n\"I think the 12th hole for me was key,\" he said. \"12 was playing very difficult, straight into the wind. I hit driver, 4-iron there too, the best shots I've hit all week, to about 30 feet and made par there.\n\n\"From then on, I felt like down out of the left coming in, it was playing quite difficult, but I felt like you could give yourself chances on the way in, and that's what I did.\"\n\nAsked if, in boxing parlance, he felt he had a good chin, he smiled and said: \"Yeah. I've faced a lot of s**t over the years. I feel like mentally I'm in a good place.\"\n\nAssessing his round overall, he said: \"I felt like I went out there, I was in control of my ball, did all the right things for a lot of the round. Then, when I got in a bit of trouble, I felt like I really finished the round well.\n\n\"I'm pretty happy with the day. To be leading this tournament after two days, it's why you come here, it's why we're here.\n\n\"Yeah, I'll sit back and watch a bit of golf in the afternoon and see where it leaves me come the end of the day, and get out there tomorrow.\n\nThe job tomorrow as well is to try to put myself in a position to win this tournament on Sunday, and that's what I'll try and do.\"\n\nThe 2019 champion got off to the perfect start, making a nine-footer for an opening birdie to join overnight leader Dan Brown at the top on six-under.\n\nHe had a chance from eight feet at the third but was soon out in front on his own as he zipped his 82-yard third back to a few inches at the par-five fourth and tapped in to get to seven-under.\n\nHe eventually made his first bogey of the week at the par-three third, where he was bunkered short of the green. But while he missed a 10-footer for birdie at the sixth, he made two at the Postage Stamp from 11 feet to turn in two-under.\n\nAfter taking six at the 11th, he hit solid shots at the 12th and 13th, then made an eight-footer for par at the 197-yard 14th before making birdie at the par-five 16th to get back to six-under.\n\nHe almost got to seven-under at the 17th, where his 55-footer shaved the edge of the hole before he got there at the 18th by rolling in a 20-footer for a closing birdie three.\n\nAsked if he felt he was a good front-runner, he joked: \"I wouldn't say I'm a good runner. I don't know. I put myself there in a few big tournaments, and I've managed to knock them off.\n\n\"So I've done it a few times. I don't know. It's hard to win tournaments. We'll see. I'll tell you Sunday evening.\"\n\nReturning to the 11th, he admitted he hasn't always been so composed.\n\n\"Sometimes you are in a frame of mind that you get on with it better than other times,\" he said. \"This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there. Almost ready for anything that's thrown at me.\n\n\"I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Independent"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_keogh@independent.ie", "name": "Brian Keogh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulex", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ulex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Links_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Links (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sniper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Offaly", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County Offaly"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Offaly"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ayrshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Troon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunkered", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bunkered"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/8ip8LYNgWMUHPjmuOErjChXjagI=/5x0:3241x2157/629x0/prod-mh-ireland/8b544da2-5534-4203-9cc9-e6d4310f328c/f29daa83-ba80-4674-abc9-aba00ada52fe/8b544da2-5534-4203-9cc9-e6d4310f328c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

I'd like to play like that over the next two days, but I've just got to kind of take it one shot at a time.\n\n\"So just kind of try to get myself in contention, and then anything happens on Sunday.\"\n\nSmith's Championship is one he'll wish to forget in a hurry.\n\nHe followed up his opening 80 - his worst ever score at a major - with a 74 that left him at 12 over for the two days, a yawning 19 shots behind playing partner Lowry.\n\nScott, fresh from his runners-up spot at the Scottish Open, had begun at one under, but after a couple of early bogeys, then suffered a double at the 'Postage Stamp' eighth hole where he failed to extricate himself from a greenside bunker and missed a short putt.\n\nThe little 120-yard horror may have spooked him as he turned for home with three more straight bogeys but with a lost weekend looming, the tough 44-year-old holed a 31-footer for birdie at the penultimate hole to ensure his 77 should be enough, on the projected cut line of five over, to make his 19th Open cut from 24 attempts.\n\nLee fared worse still, slumping from his overnight level-par to nine over with an 80 that featured one double-bogey and seven bogeys.\n\nAmateur Jasper Stubbs carded a creditable 72 for an 10 over total that at least beat Smith's total by two, while Elvis Smylie had his work cut out on his major debut as he slumped to eight over after five holes.", "source": {"uri": "aap.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "AustralianAssociatedPress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Scott_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Scott (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Lowry_(soccer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Lowry (soccer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_Woo_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Min Woo Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claret_Jug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claret Jug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Day", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoylake", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hoylake"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hoylake"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lennon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Lennon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www-media.aap.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20033403/d899035e-58fa-424d-895e-481ac8dcf5b6.jpg?v=1721410447", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Not everybody got cracking, of course. Some fell flat on their faces.\n\nOn a driech, pitiless day, with the wind departing its prevailing direction and tossing all that practice into chaos, Rory McIlroy's shattering 78 was his worst score in a major since a 79 in The Open across the water at Portrush in 2019.\n\nDressed in all black, he looked as sombre as an ageing priest shuffling to deliver some mournful news. The last rites were already being murmured to McIlroy's Open ambitions as he finished a whopping 13 shots behind the surprise leader Daniel Brown.\n\nThe 29-year-old Brown cosied home a birdie putt on the last at 9.34pm to pinch the lead from Shane Lowry with a six-under 65 and leave those golf writers hastily rehashing their copy. Girvan's Bar would have to wait.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, the reigning US Open champion, had suggested earlier in the week that Royal Troon \"has some teeth.\" It was hardly a revelatory observation.\n\nThose gnashers were on show yesterday and they took a good chomp out of DeChambeau's confidence and aspirations as he huffed and puffed to a 76.\n\nFor many, it was a day of carnage and calamity that could've ended with them being wheeled down the Craigend Road on a hospital gurney. A pained Tiger Woods probably would've welcomed the lie down.\n\nThe dour, damp conditions were the worst kind for his creaking frame and a wretched day ended with a 79. Cameron Smith, a brilliant Open winner just two years ago, fared even worse with an 80 while Henrik Stenson, the heroic champion at Troon in 2016, returned with a 77.\n\n\"You can't reach any of the par-5s on the front nine,\" bleated Tyrrell Hatton after a 73. Diddums. \"Brutal,\" added the defending champion Brian Harman with a succinct summing up of affairs. His own 73 wasn't too bad in the circumstances.\n\nBrown's 65, in contrast, was terrific. In the gathering gloom, with grandstands sparsely populated by the hardcore getting their money's worth, it wasn't the most rousing march up the 18th for the English Open debutant.\n\nIt was still a moment to savour, though, for a man who had missed six cuts in his last eight events on tour. \"It was very dark,\" said Brown. \"I am very excited, but I have got to keep my feet on the ground.\"\n\nLowry's 66 was a cracker too. The 2019 Claret Jug winner polished off his bogey-free round at the back of 8pm with a birdie putt of six feet.\n\n\"It's dinner time, lads,\" smiled Lowry, who was well aware that the golf scribblers were missing out on their usual foie gras and filet mignon. When Brown emerged well over an hour later, we'd given up on getting pudding too.\n\nThis was Lowry's lowest opening round in a major, but the canny 37-year-old is not one to get carried away. There's plenty of golf to be played yet.\n\n\"Look, it's good, it's great, but there are three rounds left,\" he said. \"If I don't play well the next three rounds, it doesn't matter what I shot today. I'd give anything to win this tournament again.\n\n\"The walk down 18 was pretty cool. It's the greatest walk in golf, and I got to do it on a Sunday afternoon with a full house (in 2019). That's the plan, to try to get to do that again.\"\n\nA purposeful, profitable performance with the putter certainly aided Lowry's assault. A productive reconnaissance mission to Troon a couple of weeks ago helped too.\n\n\"In all the practice rounds this week, we played the front nine down wind and the back nine into the wind,\" he said. \"But fortunately, I came here two weeks ago, and I played in this wind that I played here. I saw the golf course in every wind possible.\"\n\nThe early standard has been set by Justin Thomas. It was something of a redemptive moment for the American. A year ago, in the first round of The Open at Hoylake, a troubled Thomas sagged to an 82.\n\nHere at Troon, a three-under 68 had him riding high. It wasn't plain sailing. Nothing is on this formidable patch of terrain.\n\nHaving reached the four-under mark through 10 holes, the 31-year-old, who has missed the cut in five of his last seven majors, stumbled to a double-bogey on the 12th and a bogey on 13.\n\nA brace of birdies to finish, highlighted by a putt of 25-feet on the last, raised his morale and his position.\n\n\"I know things are continuing to work in the right direction,\" said Thomas, who led last week's Scottish Open after a first round 62 but slithered out of the running.\n\nAt the end of a long, long Open day, it was Brown who had assumed command.

However, he has plenty of time to recover and become a top competitor at the tournament.\n\nThe top performer in the first round was England's Daniel Brown, who ended his first outing with a -6 score. He was consistent throughout his opening run, as he ended every hole with a par or better. If he continues to perform at a high level during the second round, then he could develop a decent lead for the weekend.\n\nIreland's Shane Lowry also had a great first round score, as he is close to overtaking Brown in the standings.

The twice former PGA champion galloped to four under after 10 holes before hitting trouble but finished strongly, sinking a long birdie at the last to set the pace. Sweden's Alex Noren, England's Justin Rose, Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard and American Russell Henley finished on two under in testing conditions.\n\nSeveral big names struggled though in testing conditions on the Ayrshire coast, not least U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau who carded a five-over 76 which included an eagle- three at the 16th. World number two Rory McIlroy was even further back after a round of 78 left him fighting to make the cut. Thomas, who has never had a top-10 finish at the Open and missed the cut last year, birdied the second, fourth and seventh and the Postage Stamp par-three eighth. But a double bogey six at the 12th and a bogey at 13 stunted his progress before he holed a par putt from 17 feet at the 15th and birdied the last two holes. \"I played so well today but gave a couple back at the beginning of the back nine,\" former world number one Thomas said. \"I'm playing really well and feeling confident about my game. It's nice to get off to a good start in a major.\"\n\nPlay began under cloudy skies at 6.35am local time on the Ayrshire coast with 1997 Open champion Justin Leonard striking the first tee shot of the day. He finished with an 80 but was not the only player struggling as the course bared its teeth. Northern Ireland's McIlroy, bidding for his fifth major title 10 years after his last one, was also caught out by the conditions. He bogeyed the first and dropped two shots at the Postage Stamp as his bunker escape rolled back into the cavernous sand trap.\n\nThings got worse when he bogeyed the 10th and emerged with a double bogey at the 11th after hitting his tee shot out of bounds over the railway track skirting the course. Two more bogeys ensured he will need something special on Friday to take part at the weekend.Reigning champion Brian Harman, whose putter took him to glory at Hoylake, carded a two-over 73, as did Spain's Jon Rahm.\n\nLarge galleries headed out to watch home favourite Robert MacIntyre who was joined by Rahm and England's Tommy Fleetwood.MacIntyre, who won last week's Scottish Open, signed for a

People say flick a switch and go and make it happen. It is just not that easy, is it? You lose your trust, a bit of self-belief and that doubt creeps in some small percentage. And you can't quite play how you used to play\n\n\"Rory is only 35, fit as a fiddle, strong, hitting the golf ball great but an awful lot of scar tissue and damage. And then of course he put himself in an unbelievable position at Pinehurst and then it all went wrong. Amazing how one putt from two feet on the 16th, you suddenly doubt yourself and you think 'Oh my goodness'. You can see how his mind got scrambled.\n\n\"That unfortunately is another moment where he was so close, like St Andrews. He was leading by, what, three? Had a great putt over on the ninth, missed it and of course, Cam Smith goes birdie-birdie. And then all of a sudden he could have been four ahead and you are only one. Little things like that.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\n\"On the technical side, as we know with his short game, anything from a 9-iron in, he doesn't trust it 100 per cent. He knows occasionally he pulls some left and then you guard against that. It is a brutal game between their ears.\"\n\nMcIlroy wore a pained expression as he faced the media in the immediate aftermath of Thursday's opening round, knowing that his realistic hopes of contending for the win this week were over.\n\n\"Difficult day,\" he said. \"I felt like I did okay for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and left it in and made a double.\n\n\"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through 9, thinking that I could maybe get those couple shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\nThen hitting the ball out of bounds on 11, making a double there. Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did.\n\n\"The course was playing tough. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week. I guess when that happens, you play your practice rounds, you have a strategy that you think is going to help you get around the golf course, but then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Yeah, just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nMcIlroy will need to navigate Troon under par in his second round, which begins at 3.10pm.

We call 'em like we see 'em around here. They are:\n\nShane Lowry: Endured an adventurous double bogey on 11 but was otherwise tidy during a 2-under 69 he wrapped up around lunchtime. The 2019 Open champ is your solo 36-hole leader.\n\nDaniel Brown: This year's \"Who is this guy?\" stands to light up internet search engines for at least one more day after a gritty 1-over 72. The Englishman two behind Lowry and right in the mix entering the weekend.\n\nDustin Johnson: Critics look at the nonchalant demeanor and recent majors results (missed cuts in three of the last four) and think DJ is mailing it in at age 40, but a Friday 69 showed plenty of heart and game. He's in the picture for the weekend at 1 over and will be back next year with a top-10 finish -- important considering this is his last exempt Open from his 2020 Masters win.\n\nJustin Rose: The former U.S. Open champ earned his spot in this field via a 36-hole qualifier, and he's making the most of it: his long birdie at 18 was a highlight-reel moment to cap a 68 and a tie for second place with Brown entering the weekend.\n\nhttps://x.com/TheOpen/status/1814353864059170834\n\nScottie Scheffler: Signed for a 1-under 70 during the calmer weather on Friday morning, and there he is again: 2 under for the tournament, five shots back, the very definition of lurking. Expect everyone currently listed above his name on the yellow boards to keep one eye on him this weekend.\n\nTiger Woods: Expectations were already low to start the week, but seeing Woods hobble and bobble around Troon to rounds of 79 and 77 was at times difficult to watch.

He bogeyed the first and dropped two shots at the Postage Stamp as his bunker escape rolled back into the cavernous sand trap. Things got worse when he bogeyed the 10th and emerged with a double bogey at the 11th after hitting his tee shot out of bounds over the railway track skirting the course.

You can infer from that instruction this was not the best day in the career of Rory McIlroy. An opening round of 78, including an out of bounds at 11 and a double at the par-three 8th, left him fighting to stay in the championship.\n\nA month ago he allowed the US Open to slip from his grasp over the closing four holes at Pinehurst. That was a no-question day, so maybe there is still hope. McIlroy went straight from the scorer's hut to a waiting car and was not heard from again until he sent out a congratulatory note to winner Bryson DeChambeau on his social channels.\n\nSome might tie the two events together and conclude that the tail-spin from Pinehurst was still a factor in McIlroy's head on the first day at Royal Troon. Except that this was not that kind of meltdown. Rather, it felt more like an old trope with which McIlroy has grappled before at this tournament.\n\nAt Royal St George's 13 years ago after a Saturday going backwards in similarly filthy conditions, McIlroy vented his spleen, declaring he would not be adjusting his game to fit the needs of a challenge that he felt was unrepresentative of the discipline in which he was engaged. In other words, what transpired in Kent that day was not golf but a perversion of it, an experience so corrupted by the weather as to bear little resemblance to the game he played every other week of the year.\n\nInterestingly, his fellow Northern Irishman, Darren Clarke, stood tallest that week, winning his only major. Here Clarke shot a 75, two better than McIlroy with whom he played on Tuesday.\n\nIt was sunny then, and all was well in McIlroy's world.\n\nIn 2010 at St Andrews, McIlroy followed up an opening 63 posted in favourable conditions with an 80 in winds gusting at 40mph plus.\n\nThere have been other shockers too, notably in 2013 at Muirfield, where he opened with a 79 and admitted he needed help with the mental side of the game. Five years ago he confessed that the pressure of playing before a home crowd at Royal Portrush was a factor in registering a quadruple bogey eight on the first hole of the tournament.\n\nHe rallied with a 65 on the second day but it was not enough to make the weekend.\n\nIf we were to connect all his bad stuff at the Open there appears to be a failure of will in conditions that don't suit his game. He seems incapable of rousing himself, his body language telling its own miserable tale.\n\nThis is not to say McIlroy lacks resilience per se, only that there is something unique to this event that has the potential to bring him low, to drag him into an all-consuming fug.\n\nThough he started with a bogey, matters did not turn evil until Royal Troon's signature hole, the shortest on the Open rota affectionately known as the Postage Stamp. McIlroy's ball appeared to hold on the putting surface yet such is the wicked nature of links golf, appearances are frequently deceiving.\n\nThere was in McIlroy's ball an unseen half-roll left in it, and, with it, the fatal call of gravity. Off it rolled with inexorable consequences into the greenside bunker. His first attempt to escape saw the ball fall back to his feet. The second found the green but too far from the pin to avoid a double-bogey.\n\nHe scrambled a par at the 9th before letting another shot go at the 10th. By the time he stood on the 11th tee, there was a look of desperation about him. The cheeks were puffing big time when the arc of his ball began to trace to the right, destined, as it were, for the wrong side of the railway tracks.\n\nWe have seen this look before, a combination of frustration and despair. When you hit a ball as prodigiously as McIlroy, processing outcomes as inexplicably bad as the tee shot at 11 becomes a kind of trauma.\n\nHe took a moment to reload then split the ether with a bullet of a strike that split the fairway, begging the question, why could he not do that moments before?\n\nThis was his attempt at an answer: \"I felt like I did OK for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp, left it in and made a double. But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine, thinking that I could maybe get those couple shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\n\"Then hitting the ball out of bounds on 11, making a double there. Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did. The course was playing tough. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens, you play your practice rounds, you have a strategy that you think is going to help you get around the golf course, but then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Just one of those days where I didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nMcIlroy finished 10 behind clubhouse leader Justin Thomas, his hitting partner at the Bears Club in Florida.

People say flick a switch and go and make it happen. It is just not that easy, is it? You lose your trust, a bit of self-belief and that doubt creeps in some small percentage. And you can't quite play how you used to play\n\n\"Rory is only 35, fit as a fiddle, strong, hitting the golf ball great but an awful lot of scar tissue and damage. And then of course he put himself in an unbelievable position at Pinehurst and then it all went wrong. Amazing how one putt from two feet on the 16th, you suddenly doubt yourself and you think 'Oh my goodness'. You can see how his mind got scrambled.\n\n\"That unfortunately is another moment where he was so close, like St Andrews. He was leading by, what, three? Had a great putt over on the ninth, missed it and of course, Cam Smith goes birdie-birdie. And then all of a sudden he could have been four ahead and you are only one. Little things like that.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\n\"On the technical side, as we know with his short game, anything from a 9-iron in, he doesn't trust it 100 per cent. He knows occasionally he pulls some left and then you guard against that. It is a brutal game between their ears.\"\n\nMcIlroy wore a pained expression as he faced the media in the immediate aftermath of Thursday's opening round, knowing that his realistic hopes of contending for the win this week were over.\n\n\"Difficult day,\" he said. \"I felt like I did okay for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and left it in and made a double.\n\n\"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through 9, thinking that I could maybe get those couple shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\n\nThen hitting the ball out of bounds on 11, making a double there. Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did.\n\n\"The course was playing tough. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week. I guess when that happens, you play your practice rounds, you have a strategy that you think is going to help you get around the golf course, but then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Yeah, just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nMcIlroy will need to navigate Troon under par in his second round, which begins at 3.10pm.

No doubt about that. Eight of the top ten after two rounds teed off on Friday before 10am here. That's no coincidence.\n\nJustin Rose, who started at lunchtime, was a one-man chasing pack through much of the afternoon. The difficulties involved through the day were such that there were less players under par by close of play than when it began.\n\nStill, none of the playing conditions here have been anything like easy. Lowry had thumbed his nose at all of them, fashioned his golf around them, but a time had to come when the gods would test him. Or a photographer.\n\nOne camera moving at the wrong time was all it took. Lowry saw it in the corner of his eye, lost his focus and sent his approach from the rough flying sideways, over the fairway and the gallery opposite and into the gorse.\n\nWhat followed would have tested Job himself. His original was lost and found, there were rulings debated and confirmed, a penalty drop and, eventually, a blind chip of about 125 yards to the front of the green on the way to a double bogey.\n\nThe whole episode took over 20 minutes but, while he let the snapper have it with some choice words, there was a noticeable calming of what could have been boiling waters by the time he hit what turned out to be an unnecessary provisional.\n\nLowry closed his eyes, cranked his neck skywards and uttered a few silent words. This is what we call a reset these days. Sports psychologists preach this stuff so that players have roadmaps to follow when the temptation is to snap a club over the knee.\n\nIs that what he was doing? Was he leaning on this modern method?\n\n\"No. Sometimes you are in a frame of mind that it works better for... You know, you get on with it better [sometimes] than other times. This week in my head feels like that, where I think I'm ready to take what comes, take what's given to me out there.\n\n\"Almost ready for - I don't want to be negative - anything that's thrown at me, I feel like I'm ready to take it on the chin and move on. I just have to deal with it and try and make the best of it and see where it leads me.\" This is part of what draws us to him.\n\nA world-class sportsman, Lowry has managed to reach that high plateau by climbing without some of the safety harnesses packed by so many others. It leaves him susceptible to spectacular falls but it is rarely short of required viewing.\n\nAnd there's more to come.\n\nOffaly's finest sits two shots clear at the halfway stage on seven-under with Rose his closest pursuer after his superb three-under 68. Of the ten players better than even par, five of them have won majors. Other 'names' lie a couple of shots further back.\n\nLowry is comfortable in that company.\n\nHe left Carnoustie in tears after missing the cut at the 2018 Open and reflected later about how the game wasn't his \"friend\" at the time. He was visited by self-doubt the Sunday morning at Portrush before winning in 2019.\n\nLetting the 2016 US Open slip on the back of a four-shot, 54-hole lead took an age time to process. It's only a matter of weeks since he was left \"close to tears\" after carding an 85 at the Memorial. It's a cruel game.\n\nHe said once that his scorecard wouldn't matter to his daughter Iris - this was before her sister Ivy was born - and that perspective held on a more mundane level after his testing chapter at the 'Railway' 11th.\n\nHe made for the 12th tee happy enough to have signed for a six, then lashed driver and a four-iron into the teeth of the wind. They were his two best shots of the week under the circumstances and utterly key to his round.\n\nBirdies at 16 and 18 left him on seven-under and in the outright lead, the second of those prompting yet another fist pump from a player who has managed to balance that sort of raw emotion with a calm when the occasion requires it.\n\n\"Like, I can get a bit down on myself and a bit hot-headed at times, but I really feel like that's why I've had the career I've had. I've spoken to people, my coach and my team about this at times.

The Northern Irishman also dropped shots at the 10th, 15th, and 18th holes.\n\nThe 35-year-old golfer attributed his poor performance to the challenging weather conditions and his inability to adapt quickly enough.

Daniel Brown (six under) holds the lead after an eventful Day 1. What was the biggest surprise on Thursday at The Open?\n\nJosh Sens, senior writer (@JoshSens): I'll pluck the low-hanging fruit and go with Rory McIlroy's seven-over opening round. No doubt he drew some of the worst of the weather, but a few of his stumbles -- the OB tee shot on 11, the indifferent wedge on 13 and so on -- seemed as much mental glitches as anything. I'm not sure that anything in links golf counts as a true shocker -- we're supposed to expect the unexpected -- but often what's even harder to get a handle on these days is what's going on in Rory's head.\n\nJosh Berhow, managing editor (@Josh_Berhow): Daniel Brown is 29 years old and making his first major start, and before his 61st-place finish at the Genesis Scottish Open, he had missed six cuts and withdrew from another tournament in a seven-event span. So of course he leads! He birdied two of the last three and didn't make a bogey for a brilliant major debut. But other than Brown's surge up the leaderboard, the answer has to be Rory. Like so many others I thought he'd really bounce back this week, but we didn't see that today.\n\nJack Hirsh, assistant editor (@JR_HIRSHey): It's Justin Thomas' late-round recovery. He took the lead at four under, which, despite his opening-round 62 last week, is surprising on its own. But then his round could have gone off the rails when he couldn't do anything with the best drive of the day on 11, doubled 12 and bogeyed 13. I thought we were heading for a 75 and eventually another missed cut in what's been a long streak of bizarre play from the two-time major winner. But he righted the ship, knocked it stiff on 17, one of the toughest holes all day, and made a solid birdie putt at the last to grab the best round of the morning wave.\n\nRyan Barath, equipment editor (@rdsbarath): Rory's first round was truly shocking, and to be fair so was Bryson DeChambeau's. Both of these players handled tough conditions at Pinehurst extremely well, and today I was hoping to see them jockeying for position atop the leaderboard at Royal Troon -- not sitting well below the potential cutline. If I had a second pick, I agree with Jack in that Justin Thomas' recovery was not what I was expecting after his mid-round troubles. He still continues to struggle with consistency, and after the double bogey I was half expecting a full ejection.\n\nDylan Dethier, senior writer (@dylan_dethier): The biggest surprise, for me, was a delightful one: Troon played tough! I know the fellas snuck a couple low ones through at the end (shoutout Dan Brown) but the fact that only 17 pros are under par after the first round means good scores were well earned. The only thing better than an Open is a tough Open.

Until that point, the Northern Irishman had just about held things together.\n\nEven a double-bogey at the 8th, Troon's fabled Postage Stamp, which sent him to two-over-par for his round, could be put down to an aberration; McIlroy's tee shot finding the green and seemingly coming to a rest before catching the downslope and slowly, agonisingly, rolling into the right greenside bunker from which he took two shots to escape.\n\nIt was unfortunate. But McIlroy bounced back from that misfortune with a good par save on nine and was hanging in there. \"I felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through nine,\" he said later. \"I was thinking that I could maybe get those couple of shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that.\"\n\nFor McIlroy, it never rains but it pours. Another bogey on 10 sent him to three-over, and perhaps that was the problem. Irritated, he lined up with driver on 11. With the wind coming from behind, left to right, he did not need to take the risk, but either way he got it horribly wrong, his ball not only finishing out of bounds but the other side of the Glasgow-Ayr train line entirely. McIlroy was lucky not to hit the 1300 service from Glasgow Central which had just left Barassie. Naturally, he then reloaded and striped a brilliant drive down the middle.\n\nMcIlroy would eventually trudge off that hole, shoulders slumped, with a second double bogey on his scorecard, while behind him fans swarmed over the track, looking for a ball they could sell on eBay.\n\nSuffice to say, this seven-over-par 78 was not the round McIlroy wanted or needed after his heartbreak at Pinehurst last month, where he spurned that golden opportunity to win his first major in over a decade by missing two tiddlers in his last three holes. McIlroy said on the eve of this championship he was confident he could put himself in contention.\n\nOne day in and you would have to say, his hopes of lifting the curse here in Troon are over. McIlroy could go low today, of course. He has been known to follow up poor rounds with great ones. At Portrush in 2019, he followed up an opening round 79 with a 65 on day two (it still wasn't enough to make the cut). At St Andrews in 2010 he shot a second round 80 but bounced back to shoot 69-68 and finish in a tie for third. It would surprise no one if he shot in the low 60s today.\n\nBut even McIlroy was not sounding overly confident at the finish. Asked afterwards whether he felt he could still pull this back, he paused for what seemed an eternity. \"All I need to focus on is tomorrow and try to make the cut,\" he eventually replied. \"That's all I can focus on.\" As ever with McIlroy, the body language spoke volumes.\n\nA few hours earlier, as he got his round under way in the Ayrshire rain, he looked happy enough. Chatting merrily with playing partner Tyrrell Hatton, McIlroy played the opening holes conservatively, eschewing driver off the tee, punching irons into the wind.\n\nHe bounced back from a bogey at the first with a birdie at the third. And while the double at the Postage Stamp clearly rocked him, he did not fold. An excellent up-and-down on nine kept him at two-over-par. McIlroy's wife, Erica Stoll, and father, Gerry, followed behind, mixing with the crowds.\n\nMcIlroy actually scrambled pretty well all day. He might well have had a treble on 11 had he not got down in two from off the green. He saved par with an excellent up-and-down from a bunker on 17. And it looked as if he would save par again on 18 despite finding a fairway bunker with his drive. McIlroy splashed out of that trap, then hit a glorious approach. His putting once again let him down.\n\nIt came as no surprise to media waiting in the mixed zone that McIlroy would be taking \"three questions only\". By the 18th, the friendly chat with Hatton had long since dried up and he looked to have the weight of the world on his shoulders again.\n\nPerhaps McIlroy will bounce back on Friday. Perhaps not. Every time he tees it up in a major, it feels as if mentally the challenge gets more difficult. Naturally, McIlroy denied he was suffering any sort of US Open hangover.\n\n\"No, I wouldn't say so,\" he insisted. \"I just think that your misses get punished a lot more this week than even last week [at the Scottish Open]. The rough, the balls that I hit in the rough today, the lies were pretty nasty. It was just one of those days where I didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\"\n\nThe problem for McIlroy is that 'those days' are magnified more than for any other player.

In 2023 he played some decent stuff at the Scottish Open and then went and missed the cut at Hoylake a week later, so the Renaissance Club was a no-no.\n\nThe alternative was four days of peace and quiet playing Hog's Head with a few friends in pitch perfect 15-mph wind conditions and he made time to pop over to Wimbledon with his wife Wendy too.\n\nThe Royal Box, to be exact, and he took his seat having met with Novak Djokovic before the round of 16 clash with Holger Rune and an aftermath in which the Marmite Serb admonished the fans for their \"disrespectful\" 'Ruuuuuune' chants.\n\nDjokovic had spent time with the European team before last year's Ryder Cup win in Rome and Lowry was well impressed with the way the controversial tennis legend spoke to Luke Donald's men before their clash with Team USA.\n\n\"To be honest, I said to Luke, 'the speech he gave us would nearly be better for Bethpage next year'. When you watch him play it feels like the whole stadium is against him but he turns the other way where he feels like everyone is cheering for him. That's how he does it.\"\n\nLowry will hardly turn to that speech for inspiration for encouragement here on Scotland's west coast this week given the Ayrshire region is already sprinkled lightly with a spread of fans with Irish accents long before the first tee approaches.\n\nThese early-week days make for the toughest of times.\n\nThis is Lowry's 46th major, he has claimed eight top tens including that one title and made his debut in the big leagues as far back as 2010 but he still admits to a tightening of the stomach now at the age of 37.\n\nWinning that Open in 2019 hasn't insulated him from the nerves. If anything, it has left him more exposed.\n\n\"I think it adds more pressure. I feel like when you've tasted success, you just want it even more. That's just the way it is. I feel like I wanted so bad to win another one. Just give me one more and I'll be happy,\" he laughed.\n\n\"That's all I want. Is it too much to ask for?\" He's in and around 25/1 in the odds and you can see why. His one cut in 15 starts was his first of the year, there was the win at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans with Rory McIlroy and four other top tens and a tie for 19th at the US Open and tie for sixth at the US PGA.\n\nHe's 15th in the FedEx rankings and way ahead of the field average in strokes gained overall, off the tee and on his approaches. The figures aren't as impressive on the greens but Lowry feels he turned a corner with his putting at that Zurich win in late April.\n\nIt's been anything but dull with a 62 at the US PGA in May followed less than a month later by an 85 at the final round of the Memorial Tournament but his penchant for digging in was there again with a tie for ninth at the Travelers late last month despite a period of illness.\n\n\"It has been good. Don't get me wrong, it is my best season on the PGA Tour, so far. Golf is a funny game, isn't it? In the last two months I have shots two 62s and an 85, and it is just funny. I feel like that is just golf, that's what it is just like.\n\n\"You never take anything for granted. The good times don't last forever and the bad times don't last forever. You just have to get on with it when you can and ride the wave when you are playing well. Look, I feel like I am playing okay now.\"\n\nAs Marisa Tomei would say, the biological clock is ticking. Lowry has spoken before about the sands of time and he is 37 now but Padraig Harrington made the point to him a few months back that he was the same age when putting together one of his best seasons.\n\nThe Dubliner was only weeks out from his 37th birthday when he retained his Open title at Royal Birkdale and standing at a career high of third in the global rankings. Ultimately, none of those things matter. Or his form, as Lowry said himself.\n\nThis is about the here and the now. Why not him again?", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_o_brien@irishexaminer.com", "name": "Brendan O'Brien", "type":

Miss and you're in trouble - something McIlroy learnt the hard way.\n\nThe four-time major winner found one of the lethal, steep-sided bunkers to the right of the green and paid the price with his first attempt to escape finding the putting surface - albeit briefly - before it trundled all the way back to its sandy grave. The error marked a double bogey for McIlroy and the beginning of the death of his round.\n\nFrom there, there was no redemption. The links courses of the British Open are notorious for rarely offering up shots, and devastatingly harder to claw back from.\n\nBogeys at the tenth and 15th along with another double at the 11th followed, sinking McIlroy further down the leaderboard.\n\nMore bunker trouble at the 18th, this time in the form of the sandy traps lining the fairway, sealed his sentence of seven-over.\n\nAfter falling excruciatingly short to Bryson DeChambeau last month, McIlroy stepped away from the spotlight to expel the painful memories of his Pinehurst nightmare. Yet if his opening round is anything to by, it clearly still haunts him.\n\nHolding a two-shot lead during the final round of last month's major, McIlroy carded three bogeys across the final five holes - missing two putts from a combined distance of seven feet.\n\nHe fled the course a matter of minutes after DeChambeau wrapped up victory in North Carolina, not to be seen again until he stood on the tee at The Renaissance Club last week - this time with wife Erica Stoll in tow.\n\nMcIlroy's US Open heartbreak may have been soothed by the rekindling of his romance with his briefly-estranged wife.\n\nOn the eve of the US Open, he announced he was calling off the divorce from his wife of seven years and mother of his daughter, Poppy.\n\nIt was only a month prior, before the PGA Championship in May, that McIlroy announced that he and Erica were to split due to their marriage being 'irretrievably broken'.\n\nDuring their short-lived separation, rumors linked the PGA Tour star to CBS Sports reporter Amanda Balionis, 38, whom he was seen hugging after the pair did an interview at the RBC Canadian Open at Hamilton Golf and Country Club in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nBut on the Tuesday before the tournament, McIlroy said in a statement: 'There have been rumors about my personal life recently, which is unfortunate. Responding to each rumor is a fool's game.\n\n'Over the past weeks, Erica and I have realized that our best future was as a family together. Thankfully, we have resolved our differences and look forward to a new beginning.'\n\nMcIlroy's attorney Thomas Sasser filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal on his behalf on June 11 in Palm Beach County Courthouse after he and Erica reportedly held secret meetings at their $22m Florida home for a month in a bid to salvage their marriage.\n\nLast week, the couple were spotted in a rare sighting on a London dinner date with his Ryder Cup teammates and their spouses. The dinner marked one of the rare occasions that McIlroy and Erica have been sighted together since reuniting.\n\nYet, while the four-time major winner may have smoothed out his marital woes, it hasn't extended to the golf course.\n\nWith Stoll expected to join her husband at a major championship for the first time since the reunion, she may find herself offering up a shoulder for him to cry on.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc",

Sorry, Rory.\n\nHe'll not go down without a fight though, with four-time major champion proving in the past that he can claw things back.\n\n\"I felt like I did okay for the first part of the round and then missed the green at the Postage Stamp there and left it in and made a double,\" said the 35-year-old. \"But still, felt like I was in reasonable enough shape being a couple over through 9, thinking that I could maybe get those couple shots back, try to shoot even par, something like that. Then hitting the ball out of bounds on 11, making a double there.\n\n\" Even though the wind on the back nine was helping, it was a lot off the left. I was actually surprised how difficult I felt like the back nine played. I thought we were going to get it a little bit easier than we did. The course was playing tough. The conditions are very difficult in a wind that we haven't seen so far this week.\n\n\"I guess when that happens, you play your practice rounds, you have a strategy that you think is going to help you get around the golf course, but then when you get a wind you haven't played in, it starts to present different options and you start to think about maybe hitting a few clubs that you haven't hit in practice. Yeah, just one of those days where I just didn't adapt well enough to the conditions.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"I just think that your misses get punished. Your misses get punished a lot more this week than even last week or even, geez, any weeks, whether you miss it in a fairway bunker or even the rough. The rough, the balls that I hit in the rough today, the lies were pretty nasty. I think it's more you just get penalised more for your misses.\"\n\nBryson DeChambeau also suffered an opening round to forget. The American was five over for the day.\n\nThe 30-year-old got off to a nightmare start with four bogeys and a double-bogey on the front nine. He recovered well enough to finish strongly with a -1 score on the back nine, giving him a total of 76 for the day.\n\nHe commented on his early issues: \"It was in and off the right and I was trying the draw the ball and the ball was knuckling a little bit. It was a really difficult challenge, and I should have just cut the ball.\n\n\"It's a completely different test (from practicing). I didn't get any practice in it, and I didn't really play much in the rain. Yeah, it's a difficult test out here.\n\n\"Something I'm not familiar with. I never grew up playing it, and not to say that that's the reason; I finished eighth at St Andrews. I can do it when it's warm and not windy.\"\n\nFellow American compatriot and legend of the game Tiger Woods finished eight over.", "source": {"uri": "heraldscotland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hazard (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/18325841/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745035", "eventUri": "eng-9745035", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 86, "relevance": 1}

With the summer only three weeks away from officially starting, many people may be thinking of becoming a pet owner, and Dr. Mike Akerley, a veterinarian with the Nova Scotia SPCA says there\u2019s no better time of year. \u201cI think it\u2019s a great time to adopt, generally people have vacation time in the summertime, you can take that time to work on obedience training, house training if needed, [and] you can spend that time and get that bond that you need before you have to go back to a busy work or school schedule in the fall,\u201d said Akerley in an interview with CTV\u2019s Crystal Garrett on Monday. While the summer may be a great time to adopt a pet, Akerley says the season also comes with a number of concerns for our furry friends, and encourages owners to reach out to their local SPCA if any health problems begin to show themselves. \u201cSome of the things we tend to think about in the summertime would be, you know those parasites right, so fleas and ticks for sure, making sure our pets are up to date on their parasite medications,\u201d said Akerley. \u201cCertain bacteria are more prevalent in the summertime, so things like leptospirosis, which there\u2019s a vaccination for. We can help out and vaccinate any pet that needs those vaccines.\u201d Akerley also points to heat stroke as a major concern for pet owners, and says there\u2019s some symptoms owners should look out for. \u201cExcessive panting, sometime collapse, vomiting, they\u2019ll feel very restless,\u201d he said. Akerley recommends pet owners take their pets\u2019 temperatures if signs of heat stroke begin to show themselves. \u201cIf you\u2019re creeping up over 39 degrees Celcius, that\u2019s kind of a warning sign to get into the shade and get some water, things like that. If you\u2019re getting up into the 40 and your pets are really distraught then you\u2019re going to need to seek veterinarian attention,\u201d he said. People might think to let their pets go for a dip to cool off, and while that often helps in the heat, Akerley says to keep an eye out for blue-green algae as it has been much very common in lakes and freshwater over recent years. \u201cBlue-green algae is one of those tough ones because sometimes you can\u2019t see it in the water, it\u2019s present, but you can\u2019t see it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be prevalent in those freshwater bodies, so if we stick to sometimes the ocean and things, it\u2019s a little bit better because blue-green algae isn\u2019t going to live there.\u201d", "summary": "Warm weather is beginning to become the norm around the region, but heat and sun can also bring health concerns for our pets.", "url": "https://atlantic.ctvnews.ca/what-pet-owners-need-to-know-before-heading-into-the-summer-1.6919301", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/3/21/dog-1-6817182-1711056433574.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:58:33", "author": "Jesse Huot", "authors": ["Jesse Huot"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.318}

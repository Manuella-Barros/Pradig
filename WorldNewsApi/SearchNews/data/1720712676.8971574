U.S. President Joe Biden on June 9 said he had reached an agreement with French President Emmanuel Macron on the use of profits from frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine. Details weren't disclosed. The Group of Seven and EU are considering how to use profits generated by Russian assets frozen in the West to provide Ukraine with a large up-front loan now and secure Kyiv's financing for 2025. Around $281 billion in Russian central bank funds are frozen worldwide, most of it in the EU. The funds generate up to $3.8 billion annually in profit, which the EU says isn't contractually owed to Russia and therefore represents a windfall. Russia says diversion profits from frozen funds would amount to theft.

Opposition leader and Archbishop Bagrat Galstanian on June 9 led fresh protests against Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian, with several thousand people gathering in central Yerevan's Republic Square to call for his ouster. Galstanian has for several weeks led street demonstrations in protest of Pashinian's decision to cede several border areas to Azerbaijan. Pashinian has said the territorial concessions are necessary to prevent Azerbaijani military aggression against Armenia. Galstanian called on the National Assembly set a session on June 11 to bring about Pashinian\u2019s resignation and urged his supporters to remain on the streets until then.

Pakistan was due to face India in New York on June 9, although rainy weather delayed the start. India and Pakistan cricket fans gathered in New York in their thousands on June 9 for the T20 World Cup clash between the two rival countries, bringing a flavor of the subcontinent to unfamiliar terrain for the sport. The 34,000-seat temporary Nassau County Cricket Stadium on Long Island was sold out, with fans traveling from far and wide for the game. Political tensions and security concerns mean that the two rarely meet outside of major competitions, but there was no hint of such issues among the fans, who were in a festive mood despite the rain that caused a delay to the start. Pakistan supporter Eswar Malik had flown from St. Louis for the game and said the rivalry was one that Americans now understood. \"It's an old rivalry. It's like the Yankees-Red Sox...an old rivalry that goes on and on,\" he said.

(combo photo) BUDAPEST -- High turnout was reported by midday as Hungarians go to the polls in European Parliament and municipal elections that are seen by many as a test of the strength of authoritarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and his right-wing populist Fidesz party's nearly-15-year grip on power in the face of one of the strongest challenges in many years. As of 1 p.m. on June 9, election officials reported record high turnout of 33.14 percent nationwide. That is a solid increase from the 2019 vote, when 26.6 percent turnout was recorded in municipal elections and 24 percent in the European Parliament elections at the same time. Polling stations are due to close at 7 p.m. local time in an election that will be closely watched by a nervous European Union as a gauge on the increasing polling success of right-wing parties in the bloc. Peter Magyar, a lawyer and once an ally of Orban, has gained an increasing number of supporters since earlier this year with accusations of corruption and mismanagement by the Orban government. SEE ALSO: Hungary's EU, Local Polls Are A Test For Orban's 'Sovereignty' Clampdown At a rally on June 8, the 43-year-old Magyar -- the founder of the new Respect And Freedom (Tisza) party -- told tens of thousands of supporters that \"if you want it...Hungary will be the country of justice, honor, and laws.\" \"Hungary won't be the wedge, but the link, between East and West,\" he added. Orban's Fidesz party is not affiliated with any group in the European Parliament, but it hopes to benefit in the election from a rise in far-right sentiment across the continent. The number of far-right lawmakers in the European Parliament is expected to grow after the vote. Magyar's party has presented itself as a more centrist alternative to Orban's brand of illiberal populism and is likely to gain several seats in the EU legislature. Orban has angered many leaders in the European Union with his authoritarian policies, his opposition to aiding Ukraine, and his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orban, however, has claimed that casting ballots for the opposition would draw Hungary directly into the war in neighboring Ukraine and precipitate a global armed conflict.

Gabor Toka, a research professor at Central European University and author of the Vox Populi election guide, told RFE/RL that surveys may not be totally accurate and that pollsters \"ask people who respond in one way but may not vote accordingly later.\" \"There are many people who decide at the last minute who they will vote for. \"When the political situation really changes from week to week, it is of great importance exactly when the snapshot -- i.e. the survey -- was taken,\" he said. Election posters line the streets in Budapest for the June 9 municipal and EU Parliament elections in Hungary. The election will also be a test for the controversial Sovereignty Protection Office (SZH), established in February and which has waded into the campaign to publicly denigrate individuals and groups and criminalize candidates over accusations of foreign funding and influence. \"This agency is all set up to prevent nasty surprises for Orban in the upcoming elections,\" Kim Lane Scheppele, a Princeton University professor and expert on authoritarian regimes and Hungarian politics and law, told RFE/RL. Orban said victory in the elections \"is needed\" and predicted that Fidesz would receive \"reinforcements\" from every European country and be able to form a pro-peace European coalition in Brussels. He also commented on the U.S. presidential election, saying that Americans in November will have \"a chance to elect a pro-peace president,\" referring to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Orban, who has repeatedly said Ukraine cannot win, said the war \"has no solution on the battlefield\" and reiterated his call for negotiations to end the full-scale invasion Russia launched in 2022.

With reporting by AP and Reuters Read more Updated June 09, 2024 By RFE/RL's Bulgarian Service Early Exit Polls Give Borisov's Center-Right GERB Big Lead In Bulgaria Former Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov votes on June 9 in the town of Bankya. SOFIA -- Former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov's center-right GERB party appears to have won Bulgaria's snap parliamentary elections, according to the first exit polls in the sixth such vote in the past three years, although it remains uncertain whether any party can cobble together a governing coalition. Exit polls commissioned by national TV channels gave GERB more than 25 percent of the vote, far ahead of the second- and third-place parties in a contest that could bring the populist leader -- who has been accused of corruption by the opposition -- back to power. Exit polls show several other groups trailing GERB, including the party's erstwhile partner in the outgoing coalition government, the reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria coalition (PP-DB). Also trailing are the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS) -- which has traditionally represented the Turkish and Muslim population in the country but is now led for the first time by an ethnic Bulgarian, Delyan Peevski, who has been hit by sanctions for corruption by the United States and Britain -- and the pro-Russian Revival party (Vazrazhdane). The former communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and the populist There Is Such a People are also far behind GERB. Borisov earlier on June 9 expressed doubts that any party or coalition will be able to form a new government based on early indications of voting. \"From the morning voting, I do not see how a government can be formed after these elections,\" Borisov said after casting his ballot on June 9 in Bankya, a small town outside of Sofia. He added that it did not appear likely that his GERB party would be in line for enough parliamentary seats to do it with any one potential partner and neither would the opposition with its allies. \"Either it's just us [GERB] or nobody, so there is no mathematics in this case,\" said Borisov, who declined to say who GERB would potentially nominate for prime minister. Former Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov casts his ballot at a polling station in Sofia on June 9. As of 4 p.m., voter turnout for the parliamentary elections was 20.44 percent, election officials said, down from 27.3 percent in the April 2023 election. Turnout for a simultaneous European Parliament vote was 20.89 percent, down from 39.8 percent the last time, although that count was taken an hour later at 5 p.m. Preelection polls showed that GERB and its United Democratic Forces partner would receive the most votes, with 25 percent, potentially returning Borisov to power. Regardless of the outcome, Borisov is likely to remain an influential figure and potential power broker in the country. Borisov has led three governments over the past decade, but his support has weakened amid allegations of corruption, links to oligarchs, and attacks on media freedom. The reformist PP-DB coalition was seen in preelection polls as getting about 15 percent, down from the 24.6 percent last time as many supporters may desert the party for its previous partnering with GERB. PP-DB had agreed to work with its GERB rivals on a common pro-EU platform of ensuring that Bulgaria supports Ukraine's battle against the Russian invasion, but disagreements between leaders of the two parties mean a renewed coalition government appears unlikely. Among the reasons for the breakup of the PP-DB-GERB partnership has been the PP-DB demand for reforms in the judiciary and in the security services, alleging that they have provided cover for organized crime and that they have not done enough to counter Russian influence. SEE ALSO: Pro-Kremlin Forces On Rise In Bulgaria Ahead Of European Elections GERB has been supported by DPS leader Peevski, who has been hit by sanctions for corruption by the United States under the Global Magnitsky Act, a move then matched by Britain. The pro-Ukrainian former media mogul is reportedly one of the richest people in Bulgaria. PP-DB has claimed that GERB and DPS act as one party. \"Anytime we had a meeting with Borisov, Peevski was already in the room,\" former PP-DB Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said. SEE ALSO: Former Bulgarian PM Blasts Powerful Oligarch Peevski As The Country's 'Biggest Evil' Borisov said that GERB would not partner solely with DPS to form a coalition. GERB could turn to the MRF Turkish minority party, which also has about 15 percent in the polls. If Borisov is unable to cobble together a government, another election -- the seventh in three years -- is likely, observers say. \"We are weary of elections, and we want some stability and some prosperity for the country,\" pensioner Margarita Semerdzhieva, 72, told AFP outside of a polling station in Sofia. \"I am voting for a better future,\" Antoaneta Hristova, 55, a marketing professional, told Reuters. \"But, to be honest I think we are heading into more elections -- seven in three years. We have been the laughingstock of Europe for a long time.\" A caretaker government led by Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev was sworn in by parliament on April 9 after being appointed by President Rumen Radev, who also announced the snap general elections for June 9. Following elections in April last year, Bulgaria had a joint government supported by the pro-West, reformist PP-DB and Borisov\u2019s GERB. They had agreed on an 18-month government with a rotation of prime ministers -- first Denkov from PP-DB and, after nine months, Maria Gabriel from GERB. Denkov stepped down on March 5 to let GERB lead the government for the following nine months, as agreed. But Gabriel failed to form a government, and on March 27 Denkov also rejected Radev's invitation to try to put together a cabinet. On March 28, the populist There Is Such a People (ITN) party also declined to attempt to form a government, thus setting up the June 9 election. The vote is being held alongside EU elections. Between June 6 and June 9, voters in all 27 EU member states went to the polls to elect 720 members of the European Parliament amid concerns by many leaders of a rise in far-right support in several countries. The elections are held every five years, and each country is allotted a certain number of members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in direct proportion to its population size. Voters elect national parties, but after the elections, the MEPs organize into political groups in the European Parliament that align with their parties' political ideologies. Opinion polls heading into the elections for the European Parliament put the coalition of two center-right parties, GERB and the Union of Democratic Forces, in first place.

Iran's powerful Guardians Council approved the country's conservative parliament speaker and five other candidates to run in a June 28 election called after President Ebrahim Raisi was killed in a helicopter crash last month. The council on June 9 approved the candidacy of parliament head Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, 62, a former military commander who has been seen as a potential front-runner. In a speech last week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei seemed to signal his support for Qalibaf, analysts said. The council also approved the candidacies of reformist lawmaker Masud Pezeshkian; Saeed Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator and Khamenei\u2019s representative on the Supreme National Security Council; Tehran Mayor Alireza Zakani; Amir Hossein Qazizadeh Hashemi, a conservative deputy to Raisi; and Mostafa Purmohammadi, a hard-line former interior and justice minister. It rejected an application of former President Mahmud Ahmadinejad, a populist who carried out a harsh crackdown on dissent following his disputed reelection in 2009. The council also rejected the proposed candidacy of Ali Larijani, a former parliament speaker and nuclear negotiator. On June 7, the government announced strict guidelines for the media during the abbreviated election campaign, barring any content deemed to discourage voter participation or to urge election boycotts. The regulations also criminalize the organizing of unsanctioned protests, strikes, or sit-ins. The Guardians Council announcement came one day after the main coalition of reformists said it would only participate in the election if one of its proposed candidates were approved to run. \"We must have our own candidate,\" Azar Mansuri, leader of the Reform Front, told the Fars news agency. Raisi, Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, and several other officials were killed on May 19 when the helicopter they were travelling in crashed in bad weather in a mountainous area near the country's border with Azerbaijan.

Russian forces began an offensive in the Kharkiv region along the Russian-Ukrainian border on May 10, in an action that analysts have described as a bid to establish a \"buffer zone\" to protect Russian territory. Fighting has been particularly intense around the town of Vovchansk, which the Ukrainian military said on June 8 remained \"largely\" under Ukrainian control. On May 17, Ukraine's military commander, Colonel General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said Russia had expanded the breadth of the offensive to a line of nearly 70 kilometers in an effort to force Ukraine to deploy forces from its reserves.

Andrei Kozlov, 27, was one of four hostages rescued in the operation in the town of Nuseirat after being held for 246 days by Hamas, which has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The Jerusalem Post reported on June 9 that Kozlov's parents were expected to arrive in Israel later in the day and were being accompanied by an official of the Israeli consulate in St. Petersburg. Hamas officials have said that at least 210 Palestinian civilians were killed and more than 400 injured during the operation, which was a daylight combined air and ground assault. All four of the hostages were taken from a music festival in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, in the early hours of Hamas's mass incursion into Israel. About 1,200 Israelis were killed in the initial attack. Of the nearly 250 people taken hostage in the attack, about 120 remain in captivity, while 43 have been pronounced dead. Also rescued in the operation were Noa Agramani, Almog Meir, and Shlomi Ziv.

For the sixth time in three years, Bulgarians will vote on June 9 in parliamentary elections as the poverty- and corruption-stricken Balkan country seeks to end the long stretch of political instability and, perhaps, close the door on hopes for major reforms. The vote could return populist former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov to power. Polls show that his GERB party and its United Democratic Forces partner will receive the most votes with 25 percent. Borisov has led three governments over the past decade, but his support has weakened amid allegations of corruption, links to oligarchs, and attacks on media freedom. GERB's erstwhile partner in the outgoing coalition government, the reformist We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria coalition (PP-DB), is seen as getting about 15 percent, down from the 24.6 percent last time, as many supporters may desert the party because of its previous partnering with GERB.

GERB generally says it supports reforms but has not initiated specific changes in the judiciary or among security agencies.

The so-called All-Serbian Assembly was organized under the slogan \"One People, One Assembly -- Serbia and Srpska\" and produced what it called the Declaration On The Protection Of National And Political Rights And The Common Future Of The Serbian People.\u201d Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic stated the language of the declaration was carefully chosen and that it focuses on Kosovo, takes into account the Dayton agreement that settled the Yugoslav war of the mid-1990s, and didn't mention separation from Bosnia. \"I won't intrude on [the international community's] decisions,\" he said. \"I only ask that you think a million times about how much we all need peace.\" He added, though, that Serbia \"will never abandon Republika Srpska,\" the Bosnian Serb entity. \"My only plea to you is to attempt to resolve all problems peacefully and in dialogue with all other peoples [in Bosnia] in accordance with the Dayton agreement,\" Vucic said.

Dodik stated that Republika Srpska was committed to the Dayton accords but that it is possible the entity will soon have to seek Serbia's support to resolve its status. \"It is impossible to live with those who so treacherously and maliciously, falsely, and secretly tried to impose genocide as a permanent feature of this nation, which it is not,\" Dodik told the audience at Republic Square. He added that any action will be done \"peacefully.\" SEE ALSO: Bosnian Serbs' Move Toward Secession 'Dangerous, Irresponsible,' U.S. Envoy Warns Dodik, who is friendly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been placed under sanctions by the United States and Britain over his efforts to undermine the Dayton peace accords, which led to the formation of a Bosnian state consisting of two entities -- a Bosniak-Croat federation and Republika Srpska -- tied together by a weak central government. The action comes amid high tensions after the United Nations on May 23 approved a resolution to commemorate the 1995 Srebrenica genocide in Bosnia annually, over strong opposition from Serbs. The resolution designates July 11 as the International Day of Reflection and Commemoration of the 1995 Genocide in Srebrenica, thus establishing an annual day of commemoration for the massacre of more than 8,000 local Bosnian Muslim men and boys almost 30 years ago. The UN resolution had sparked protests and a lobbying campaign by Serbia's president and the Bosnian Serb leadership to block the adoption of the resolution, which was sponsored by Germany and Rwanda with 32 co-sponsors, including the United States, France, Britain, and Italy. Dodik stated that \"we are not a genocidal people, and this resolution does not concern us in terms of implementing it.\" Dodik's Belgrade visit came after he met with Putin in St. Petersburg.

(file photo) Iran\u2019s Supreme Court has overturned a death sentence handed to Mohammad Javad Vafaei Sani, arrested over his alleged involvement in the 2019 antiestablishment protests. Babak Paknia, Vafaei Sani\u2019s lawyer, said on June 8 that the Supreme Court had struck down his client\u2019s death sentence \u201cfor a second time.\u201d He did not say when the first death sentence had been overturned. Paknia said the case would now go to a lower court. Vafaei Sani was arrested in 2020 and convicted of \u201ccorruption on Earth\u201d for allegedly \u201cintentionally damaging\u201d government buildings during the protests. \u201cCorruption on Earth\u201d is the most serious charge under Iran\u2019s Islamic penal code and is punishable by death. Last July, dozens of human rights activists appealed to Volker Turk, the United Nations' high commissioner for human rights, to intervene and help stop Vafaei Sani\u2019s execution. The unrest in November 2019 was sparked by a sudden rise in fuel prices but quickly turned into nationwide protests against the Islamic republic. The authorities clamped down on the protests and imposed a weeklong total shutdown of the Internet. According to Amnesty International, at least 321 people were killed by Iranian security forces during the protests. Last month, Amnesty said Iran had carried out at least 853 executions in 2023 -- a 48 percent rise from the previous year. Agnes Callamard, the rights group\u2019s chief, said the spike in recorded executions worldwide was \u201cprimarily down to Iran,\u201d where she said the ruling establishment sought \"to instill fear in the population and tighten their grip on power.\" \u201cThe Iranian authorities showed complete disregard for human life and ramped up executions for drug-related offenses, further highlighting the discriminatory impact of the death penalty on Iran's most marginalized and impoverished communities,\" she said.

Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said its air defenses had intercepted 27 Ukrainian drones, including over North Ossetia, marking the first drone attack on the region since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine\u2019s Air Force chief said air defenses downed nine Iranian-made Shahed-type UAVs over the central Poltava region, the southeastern Zaporizhzhya and Dnipropetrovsk regions, and the Kharkiv region in the northeast. An X-59 Russian missile launched from the Kursk region was also shot down, Oleschuk said. Russian forces, meanwhile, said they shot down Ukrainian drones over Krasnodar, Astrakhan, Belgorod, Bryansk, Rostov, Tula, and North Ossetia. Drones were also intercepted over the Russia-annexed Crimean Peninsula, the ministry said. North Ossetia\u2019s governor, Sergei Menyailo, said a military airfield in Mozdok was the target. No casualties were reported by the Russian authorities, but the downing of the drones caused some damage in several regions, including North Ossetia and Belgorod. The AFP news agency and the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper quoted a military intelligence source in Kyiv as saying the \"drone attack on the airfield in North Ossetia is a special operation of the GUR,\" referring to Ukraine's military intelligence service. A day earlier, Vladimir Saldo, the head of Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, claimed 22 people were killed and 15 were injured in the town of Sadove in shelling by Ukrainian forces. On June 8, Leonid Pasechnik, the Russia-installed governor in Ukraine\u2019s partially occupied Luhansk region, that two more bodies had been pulled from the rubble following Ukrainian missile attacks on the regional capital on June 7, bringing the death toll in the region to five. Ukraine has not commented on either attack. On the diplomatic front, French President Emmanuel Macron and U.S. President Joe Biden, meeting in Paris on June 8, repeated their support for Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.

They also met with World War II veterans. The welcome ceremony kicked off at Paris\u2019s landmark Arc de Triomphe. The presidents and first ladies then headed toward Elysee Palace in a parade procession, where they will have a working lunch. Biden has been in France since June 5 and, along with Macron, attended the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings on June 6 in Normandy, before meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy the following day. In his D-Day address on June 7, Biden sought to rally for the defense of democracy at home and abroad. \u201cAs we gather here today, it\u2019s not just to honor those who showed such remarkable bravery that day June 6, 1944,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s to listen to the echo of their voices. To hear them. Because they are summoning us. They\u2019re asking us what will we do. They\u2019re not asking us to scale these cliffs. They\u2019re asking us to stay true to what America stands for.\u201d In Biden\u2019s meeting with Zelenskiy -- their first since he signed legislation authorizing $61 billion in military aid for Ukraine -- the U.S. president announced a new $225 million package of ammunition shipments, including rockets, mortars, artillery rounds, and air-defense missiles. Meanwhile, Macron told a joint news conference with Zelenskiy on June 7 that he was finalizing what he described as the \u201clargest possible coalition\u201d of military instructors for Ukraine. Macron said Ukrainian pilots would start receiving training in the summer to use French-made Mirage 2000 fighter jets, which Paris has vowed to transfer to Kyiv. Ukraine\u2019s top commander said last week that he had signed paperwork allowing French military instructors to soon access Ukrainian training centers.

A court in Moscow has sent French citizen Laurent Vinatier to pretrial detention until at least August 5 on a charge of violating Russia's \"foreign agent\" law. The Zamoskvorechye district court announced its decision on June 7, a day after the 48-year-old expert on Russia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia, who works for a Geneva-based conflict mediation organization, was detained by Investigative Committee officers in a restaurant in the Russian capital. The Investigative Committee said then that a French citizen was detained on suspicion of gathering information about the military and failing to register as a foreign agent. The committee released a video showing a man with a blurred face being approached by masked officers in a Moscow restaurant and led to a police vehicle. According to the Investigative Committee, the man had allegedly \"collected data related to military and military-technical activities of the Russian Federation.\" French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed in a televised interview late on June 6 that Vinatier was detained in Russia, stressing that he had never worked for French government structures. The French Embassy has yet to comment on the arrest. The arrest of Vinatier came as Macron hosted ceremonies commemorating the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion on the beaches of Normandy during World War II. Earlier on June 6, French media reports said a 26-year-old native of Ukraine's eastern Donbas region with dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship was detained in France after a handmade explosive device detonated in his hotel room. The man sustained burns and is currently being treated in a hospital. He is suspected of planning a terrorist attack in France that would have targeted military aid that Paris has been sending to Ukraine. Relations between Russia and France have sunk to their the lowest point in history over Moscow\u2019s ongoing full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched in February 2022.

The commission told EU ambassadors that both Kyiv and Chisinau have fully fulfilled the outstanding reform steps needed to start official talks. \"We consider that all the steps have been met by the two countries,\" a commission spokeswoman told reporters on June 7. \"Now the decision is in the hands of the member states.\" In Ukraine's case, the reform steps included the fight against corruption, de-oligarchization, and the protection of national minorities, officials told RFE/RL. Moldova meanwhile has fulfilled criteria on judicial reform, de-oligarchization, and the fight against corruption, the officials added. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal hailed the commission's move. \"Thank you for the positive assessment of our European integration progress. The announced conclusion of the EC states that Ukraine continues systematic efforts to join the EU and has completed all additional reform steps,\" Shmyhal said.

BISHKEK -- Eleven former and current reporters for the Temirov Live investigative group in Kyrgyzstan have gone on trial in Bishkek on a charge of \"calling for mass riots,\" which the journalists and rights groups have rejected as politically motivated. Judge Kylychbek Istamkulov of the Lenin district court started the trial behind closed doors on June 7. Four of the journalists on trial -- Makhabat Tajibek-kyzy, Azamat Ishenbekov, Aktilek Kaparov, and Aike Beishekeeva -- have been held in pretrial detention since January 16. The other seven journalists were transferred to house arrest amid an outcry by domestic and international human rights groups over the case. The arrests were made after police searched the journalists\u2019 homes and offices. In April, the Kyrgyz Ombudsman's Institute said guards physically attacked Tajibek-kyzy and two of her cellmates in detention center No.1 in Bishkek. Prosecutors said at the time that they had launched a preliminary investigation into Tajibek-kyzy's complaint. Tajibek-kyzy is the wife of prominent investigative journalist Bolot Temirov, the founder of Temirov Live who was deported to Moscow in November 2022 after a court ruled that he illegally obtained Kyrgyz citizenship. Temirov, who held Kyrgyz and Russian passports, rejected the accusation and insisted that the probe against him was launched after he published the results of an investigation suggesting corruption among top Kyrgyz officials. Kyrgyz-based and international human rights groups have urged the former Soviet republic\u2019s government to immediately release Temirov Live\u2019s journalists and drop all charges against them. Kyrgyzstan's free press and civil society have traditionally been the most vibrant in Central Asia, but that has changed amid a deepening government crackdown. In early April, President Sadyr Japarov signed into law a controversial bill that allows authorities to register organizations as \"foreign representatives,\" which critics say mirrors a repressive Russian law on \"foreign agents\" that Moscow uses to muzzle free press and NGOs.

(file photo) Uzbek authorities labeled a Karakalpak group as extremist and banned it in February, the Turkmen Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights said citing Moscow-based human rights defender Vitaly Ponomaryov. According to a statement from Ponomaryov, the Alga Qaraqalpaqstan (Forward Karakalpakstan) group was banned on February 22. The group is an unregistered political party with thousands of members that promotes the independence of Karakalpakstan from Uzbekistan. Karakalpaks are a Central Asian Turkic-speaking people. Their region used to be an autonomous area within Kazakhstan before becoming autonomous within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1930 and then part of Uzbekistan in 1936. The fact that the group was banned became known during the trial of Karakalpak activist Parahat Musapbarov, who was sentenced to 6 years in prison in late May on a number of charges, including taking part in the activities of the banned group. Karakalpak activists have been under pressure in Uzbekistan since mass rallies in Karakalpakstan's capital, Nukus, in July 2022. Thousands of people protested Tashkent's plans to change the constitution in a way that would have undermined the republic's right to self-determination. SEE ALSO: The Kazakh-Uzbek 'Tandem': Good For Central Asia, Not So Good For Karakalpak Activists The protests were violently dispersed. Uzbek authorities said at the time that 21 people died during the protests, but the Austrian-based Freedom for Eurasia human rights group said at least 70 people were killed during the unrest. In January last year, an Uzbek court sentenced 22 Karakalpak activists to prison terms on charges that included undermining the constitutional order for taking part in the protests. In March 2023, another 39 Karakalpak activists accused of taking part in the protests in Nukus were convicted, with 28 of them sentenced to prison terms of between 5 and 11 years. Eleven defendants were handed parole-like sentences. The violence forced Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoev to make a rare about-face and scrap the proposal to change the constitution.

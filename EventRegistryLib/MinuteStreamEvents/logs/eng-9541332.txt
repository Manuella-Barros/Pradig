Mengesha was charged as a Fugitive from Justice and is currently being held by the Erie County Sheriff's Office, awaiting extradition.\n\nFollow us on X (formerly Twitter) @CBPBuffalo and @DFOBuffalo", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peace Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Information_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Crime Information Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockville,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rockville, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rockville, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erie County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Erie County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing_and_Regulations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Bodyart/Licensing and Regulations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/sites/default/files/styles/300px_newsroom_body_image/public/pb015_1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541332", "eventUri": "eng-9541332", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

It could be the entire batch or just a sample of the seizure, depending on what the prosecutor requests.\n\nLast year, CBP seized nearly 600,000 pounds of illegal drugs, which was down by about 16% from seizures in 2022, according to federal data.\n\nMore than half was seized along the southern border last year, and marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl were the largest amount of drugs seized last year, data showed.\n\nLaw enforcement says Mexican drug cartels are getting more creative in trying to hide loads of illicit drugs to bring illegally across the border into the United States.\n\nIn December, Border Patrol agents in California's El Centro Sector seized 218 pounds of liquid methamphetamine, totaling nearly $3.5 million, that was found inside the gas tank of a vehicle attempting to pass through a checkpoint.\n\nThe drugs can only be destroyed once the case officially closes, which can take years.\n\nKeeping the drugs that long requires extensive oversight. Seized narcotics are weighed frequently -- sometimes without warning -- to ensure they haven't been tampered with.\n\nIf there is no prosecution, the drugs are destroyed as soon as possible.\n\nCBP pays contractors to incinerate the drugs, and that process is closely overseen by a security team that watches the burning from start to finish, the agency said.\n\nWhat happens to illegal cash and currency seized at the border?\n\nOnce the agency completes an investigation and determines that seized cash was used for illegal activity and not as a result of failing to declare the money, the currency goes to the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, an account with the Department of Treasury, CBP said.\n\nThe Treasury Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture administers the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, which was established in 1992, according to a 2023 report from the Treasury Department.\n\nMoney deposited into this fund is used for several reasons, including to pay state and local law enforcement agencies that helped seize the funds, compensate victims where the seized assets represent the proceeds of fraud schemes and cover the operating costs of maintaining the fund, according to the report.\n\nThe fund also allows its participating agencies to meet \"unanticipated needs created by COVID-19 related crimes, to ensure that the agencies have the resources to target and intercept these massive schemes and return the money to the defrauded government agencies, private entities and individuals,\" the report stated.\n\nIn 2023, over $800 million was in the Treasury Forfeiture Fund.\n\nLast year, CBP seized more than $53 million in undeclared or illicit currency, which can be proceeds from alleged illicit activity or currency that funds transnational criminal organizations, federal data showed.\n\nWhere do all the weapons, contraband seized by CBP go?\n\nThe weapons and ammunition that are found to be illegal by border agents are forfeited, the agency said. Once that occurs, the title on those weapons goes to the government, after which the weapons are promptly destroyed, usually by melting, a CPB spokesperson said.\n\nThe melting is conducted by contractors but overseen in its entirety by a CBP team, the agency said.\n\nCBP data showed that agents intercepted more than 3,300 guns and over 547,000 gun parts and ammunition before they crossed the border last year.\n\nNinety-five percent, or 1,176, of those guns were stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to data. That amount reflects a massive seven fold increase from 2019, when CBP intercepted 173 guns, The Trace reported.\n\n\"U.S. firearms trafficked into Mexico, along with the U.S.'s high demand for illegal drugs, contribute to security and drug crises on both sides of the border,\" the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in a 2023 report on American security aid to Mexico.", "source":

And it's doing a terrible job of it.\n\nLet's remember the basics. Everyone has the right to seek asylum in another country. This does not mean - as the shouty hate-mongers on US TV news channels would have you believe - that anyone can just live wherever they want. No. It means you have the right to ask for asylum, and the authorities should consider your individual case and treat you humanely in the meantime.\n\nUS law guarantees this right, and it's also affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nHowever, for decades, successive US administrations - both Republicans and Democrats - have narrowed access to asylum. In a sense, the CBP One app, launched under Trump and expanded under Biden, seems no more than a high-tech continuation of a long-standing bipartisan effort.\n\nUsing CBP One is pretty much mandatory for people seeking asylum in the US. But it's clunky to use, and obviously, you need a mobile phone in the first place. This is not something every would-be asylum seeker possesses, either having lost everything in fleeing whatever danger they're running from - or seeing their phone stolen by criminals or Mexican officials along the way.\n\nMost importantly, the CBP system does not supply enough appointments through the app to meet demand. A new report goes into extensive detail, and user reviews of the app on hosting sites Google and Apple are an endless list of frustrations with functionality and desperation over delays. Asylum seekers give the app one star out of five, only because zero stars is not an option.\n\nWhat's happening here is what's called \"metering,\" that is strictly limiting the number of people allowed to seek asylum each day. In a way, again, this is nothing new: the US started doing metering by other means under Obama, and the practice was formalized under Trump. Since 2017, there have been legal challenges to metering as a violation of US and international law.\n\nThe problem created by metering - now \"digital metering\" with the CBP One app - is that tens of thousands of people seeking asylum in the US have been forced to wait in Mexico. Often, they are there for several months, exposed to serious dangers, like rape, kidnapping, torture, and murder.\n\nIf I had to review the CBP One app, I'd say: terrible app, zero stars.", "source": {"uri": "hrw.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Human Rights Watch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Customs_and_Border_Protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universal Declaration of Human Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/media_2024/04/202404us_texas_migrant_cbpone.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541332", "eventUri": "eng-9541332", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

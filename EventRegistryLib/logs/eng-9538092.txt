The Hague-based ICC did not say if the comment related to its investigation into possible war crimes by Zionist or Palestinian groups in Gaza and the West Bank. The office of ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan said on X, formerly Twitter, that it was aware of \"significant public interest\" in its activities and said it sought to \"engage constructively with all stakeholders.\"\n\nBut it added that the court's \"independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the court or against court personnel.\"Such threats, even not acted upon, may constitute an offence\" against the ICC's \"administration of justice\", it warned, calling for an end to such activity.\n\nKhan's office declined to say where the threats had come from and which investigation was concerned, when questioned by AFP. US and Zionist media reports have suggested the ICC prosecutor could issue warrants against both Zionist politicians - including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - and Hamas leaders. Netanyahu said Wednesday on X that the ICC was \"contemplating issuing arrest warrants against senior Zionist government and military officials as war criminals\".\n\n\"This would be an outrage of historic proportions,\" he said, alleging that the ICC was \"trying to put Zionists in the dock\". The Axios news outlet has reported that Zionists warned Washington it would take retaliatory steps against the Palestinian Authority that could lead to its collapse if the ICC issues arrest warrants. US members of Congress had also warned of retaliation by Washington, Axios reported. The United States says it also opposes the ICC probe into conduct in Gaza, arguing it has no jurisdiction.\n\n'Oppose any threats'\n\nNeither the United States nor Zionists are members of the court. The White House reiterated that position on Friday, while condemning any threats against the ICC. \"We obviously oppose any threats or intimidation to public officials, including ICC officials,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told a briefing.\n\nShe said she would not comment on \"what could be next and if we would weigh in if they were to move forward\" with charges. In 2020 the administration of then-president Donald Trump targeted the ICC with sanctions over its investigation into Afghanistan. The Biden administration lifted them. One legal expert said the statement by the ICC's office of the prosecutor (OTP) was likely related to the \"ongoing investigation in Palestine\" given recent Zionist government statements about \"threats to the Palestinian Authority in response to the potential issuance of arrest warrants\".\n\nZionist entity's reported retaliatory steps were aimed at the Palestinian authorities, \"not at the ICC or the OTP\", said Gabriele Chlevickaite, a researcher at the Hague-based Asser Institute for international law. However, \"some statements by Zionist officials could be interpreted as threatening the OTP officials indirectly and, or, interfering with the investigation,\" she told AFP.\n\nThis would not only be an offence under the court's founding Rome Statute \"but a blatant disregard of the rule of law,\" Chlevickaite added. The ICC opened a probe in 2021, as well as Hamas and other armed Palestinian groups, over possible war crimes in the occupied Palestinian territories. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com",

He stated he expected international leaders to use \"all the means at their disposal to stop this dangerous move\".\n\nOn Monday, Axios reported that Congress members from both parties in the US warned the ICC it would retaliate against arrest warrants being issued to Israeli leaders, including by introducing legislation sanctioning ICC officials.\n\nIsrael also warned Washington that it would take steps which would lead to the collapse of the Palestinian Authority if the indictments went ahead, according to a separate report in Axios.\n\nThe Office of the ICC prosecutor said in a statement on Friday that it welcomed \"comments, communications of concerns, and engagement\" by elected officials, NGOs and activists, following significant public interest in its investigations.\n\n\"The Office seeks to engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever such dialogue is consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially,\" it added.\n\n\"That independence and impartiality is undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfillment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt added that such threats could constitute an offence under Article 70 of the Rome Statute, which prohibits impeding or intimidating court officials by forcing or trying to persuade them not to perform their duties.\n\n\"The Office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately,\" it said.\n\nThe ICC was formed in 2002 to prosecute individuals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The crimes later included the crime of aggression.\n\nThere are 124 member states who are party to the Rome Statute, the treaty which established the court.\n\nUnder the principle of complementarity, the ICC acts as a court of last resort when member states are unwilling or unable to try heinous crimes themselves.\n\nIt can prosecute nationals of member states, as well as individuals who commit crimes on the territory of member states. It also has jurisdiction over cases referred to it by a UN Security Council resolution.\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC. However, as the state of Palestine was granted membership in 2015, the court can investigate Israeli individuals for crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territories, which include Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nIn 2021, the ICC opened an official investigation into allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in occupied Palestine since June 2014.\n\nChief prosecutor Karim Khan said in October last year that the court also had jurisdiction over crimes committed by Hamas in Israel and by Israelis in Gaza during the current war.\n\nIt is not yet clear exactly what the court is looking at in relation to Israeli officials.\n\nInternational law experts told Middle East Eye it could be: allegations of deliberate starvation; impeding the entry of humanitarian aid into the enclave; direct attacks targeting non-military objects such as hospitals, as well as inhumane treatment of Palestinian detainees.\n\nIf Israeli officials are charged, they would have to restrict their travel in and out of the 124 member states of the ICC.\n\n\"Member states have a legal obligation to cooperate fully with the court, which includes arresting those subject to an arrest warrant,\" Eitan Diamond, of the Diakonia International Humanitarian Law Centre in Jerusalem, told MEE.\n\n\"Israel and the Israeli officials concerned would not want to take the risk that states would discharge their obligation,\" Diamond added.\n\nNeve Gordon, professor of international law and human rights at Queen Mary University of London, said the issue would put ICC member states' commitment to international human rights law to the test.\n\n\"If, for example, Netanyahu is named on the arrest warrant and he can continue travelling freely and there's no problem, that jeopardises the legitimacy of the ICC itself,\" he told MEE.\n\nIn the event of ICC arrest warrants for Israelis, it is likely that leaders of Hamas will be indicted too, for its role in the 7 October surprise attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 people, most of whom were civilians.\n\nUnder the administration of President Donald Trump, the US - which is not a member of the ICC - was actively hostile towards the court. It imposed economic and travel sanctions on ICC prosecutors after the court launched a probe into possible war crimes committed by the US and its allies in Afghanistan.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration lifted those sanctions in 2021.\n\nHowever, the Biden administration has reiterated this week that it does not support any ICC investigation into Israeli crimes in Gaza because \"we don't believe that they have the jurisdiction\".", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Axios reported Thursday that senators from both parties met with ICC officials over their anxieties about the potential arrest warrants.\n\n\"The Office seeks to engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever such dialogue is consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially,\" said a statement from the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor posted on the social platform X Friday.\n\n\"That independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfillment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction,\" the statement continues.\n\n\"Such threats, even when not acted upon, may also constitute an offence against the administration of justice under Art. 70 of the Rome Statute.\"\n\nThe statement does not name the source of the threats.\n\nThe ICC came into force 2002 under an international statute giving the court jurisdiction over crimes including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression. Neither the U.S. or Israel are among the 123 state members of the court.\n\nIsrael's allies in Washington have pushed back against the possible arrest warrants, which The New York Times reported could relate to Israeli officials \"preventing the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip\" and for \"pursuing an excessively harsh response\" following Hamas's attack on Oct. 7.\n\n\"We've been really clear about the ICC investigation. We do not support it. We don't believe that they have the jurisdiction. And I'm just going to leave it there for now,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday.\n\nSen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), who chairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, added that Israel should not be investigated because it has a \"comparable system\" of it's own.\n\nAnd Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) argued that prosecutions of Israeli officials could set a precedent for the prosecution of American officials, since neither country is a signatory to the court.\n\n\"Such a lawless action by the ICC would directly undermine U.S. national security interests,\" he said in a statement. \"If unchallenged by the Biden administration, the ICC could create and assume unprecedented power to issue arrest warrants against American political leaders, American diplomats, and American military personnel, thereby endangering our country's sovereign authority.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com",

More recently, though, it seems to have grown a spine such as by pursuing Russian President Vladimir Putin. The West, of course, applauded. Now, though, the ICC may be going after one of its sacred cows. It\u2019s widely believed arrest warrants are being prepared for top leaders of both Israel and Hamas for war crimes.\n\nHowever, on Friday, the ICC released an official statement condemning efforts to \u201cintimidate\u201d the court. It came as Israel is readying an assault on Rafah that the UN humanitarian office has warned would be \u201ca slaughter of civilians and an incredible blow to the humanitarian operation in the entire strip\u201d. A million displaced Gazans are taking refuge there.\n\nWithout naming names, the ICC said: \u201cIndependence and impartiality are undermined when individuals threaten to retaliate against the court or against court personnel \u2026\n\n\u201cSuch threats \u2026 may constitute an offence against the administration of justice under Article 70 of the Rome Statute \u2026 The office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.\u201d\n\nThe Rome Statute is the 1998 treaty that established the ICC to which neither Israel nor the United States are party.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier issued a statement: \u201cThe International Criminal Court in The Hague is contemplating issuing arrest warrants against senior Israeli government and military officials as war criminals. This would be an outrage of historic proportions.\u201d\n\nYou may want to listen to the whole clip on X; the man has nothing but chutzpah.\n\nNetanyahu has reportedly asked the White House to intervene, as have a group of Democrat and Republican lawmakers. News site Axios reported that Israel had threatened to \u201ccollapse\u201d the Palestinian Authority if the ICC went ahead.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been really clear about the ICC investigation. We do not support it. We don\u2019t believe that they have the jurisdiction.\u201d\n\nThe ICC refused to comment on a meeting it reportedly held with a group of US legislators. US Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has called the ICC\u2019s planned move \u201cdisgraceful\u201d and said such warrants would be \u201cillegitimate\u201d. No such warrants have so far been issued.\n\n\u201cSuch a lawless action by the ICC would directly undermine US national security interests,\u201d he said. \u201cIf unchallenged by the Biden administration, the ICC could create and assume unprecedented power to issue arrest warrants against American political leaders, American diplomats, and American military personnel, thereby endangering our country\u2019s sovereign authority.\u201d \u201cLawless\u201d by the ICC? Johnson, too, has chutzpah aplenty \u00e0 la Netanyahu. It\u2019s not clear why going after Israel which is facing genocide charges before the International Court of Justice, the ICC threatens US sovereignty. Is it still two countries, or not?\n\nJohnson continued: \u201cThe Biden administration must immediately and unequivocally demand that the ICC stand down and the US should use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.\u201d Democrat Senator John Fetterman posted on X: \u201cIt would be a fatal blow to the judicial and moral standing of ICC to pursue this path against Israel.\u201d\n\nYou can tell by their desperate responses that the American power structure has been shaken to its core, that is, the elite nexus of corporate sponsors, billionaire donors, pro-Israel lobby, and the ruling class on Capitol Hill. Their open and shameless interference goes beyond undermining international legal protocol. It is striking at the very heart of international law and the very institution that lies at its foundation.\n\nWhen mass murders are so blatantly committed live on social and even mainstream media, the world cannot turn a blind eye even if it wanted to. Arrest warrants for Netanyahu and his clique will make the Western powers think twice before supplying more weapons to Israel.\n\nThey will restore the ICC\u2019s international prestige, by showing it can act to prevent ongoing atrocities, rather than seeking justice for past crimes.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Talks about a pause in hostilities have been deadlocked for several weeks, but signs have recently emerged a deal may not be too far away.\n\nA group of US senators held a virtual meeting with officials from the ICC on Wednesday to raise concerns about the possible arrest warrants, Axios reported late Thursday.\n\nThe ICC investigates and tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. Israel hasn't ratified the ICC's statute and doesn't recognize its jurisdiction but the \"State of Palestine\" has been a member of the court since 2015.\n\nThe ICC began an investigation into alleged crimes in the Palestinian territories of Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2021. The office of Karim Khan, chief prosecutor of the ICC, said in November that the investigation \"extends to the escalation of hostilities and violence\" since Hamas invaded Israel on Oct. 7, triggering the ongoing conflict in Gaza in which tens of thousands have died.\n\nKhan said in February he is deeply concerned about the conduct of Israeli forces, as well as of Hamas fighters holding Israeli hostages. Last year, the court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for war crimes related to the alleged abduction of children from Ukraine, a move which was dismissed by the Kremlin.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type":

The court can prosecute individuals for alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide.\n\nLast week Israel voiced concern that the ICC could be preparing to issue arrest warrants for

jurisdiction over any potential war crimes committed by Hamas fighters in Israel and by Israeli forces in Gaza, which has been ruled by Hamas since 2007.\n\nInternational law experts told Middle East

The latter is overseeing a genocide case that South Africa has brought against Israel.\n\nOver the weekend, reports emerged that ICC arrest warrants over Israel's genocide in Gaza could be forthcoming. In addition to Netanyahu, some of the names that have been mentioned as being subject to arrest warrants include Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nNetanyahu said: \"If this does happen, it will be an indelible stain on humanity. It would be an unprecedented antisemitic hate crime that would add fuel to the antisemitic incitement that is already raging in the world.\"\n\nHe appears to be at least somewhat worried about this possibility as he called on other world leaders to step up and take a stand against the ICC for investigating the Jewish state.\n\nHe said: \"Israel expects the leaders of the free world to come out strongly against this scandalous step, a step that will harm the self-defense not only of the State of Israel, but of all democracies.\"\n\nSo far, he seems to have the U.S. on his side, with the White House speaking out against both the ICJ's ruling that Israel is plausibly committing genocide in Gaza and the ICC's current investigation of Israel.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for world leaders such as Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Uganda's Joseph Kony and Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlthough the ICC has not officially confirmed impending arrest warrants, Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited the occupied West Bank and Israel in December, meeting political leaders and victims' families to discuss their experiences. He condemned the violence on both sides and vowed to investigate.\n\nIn a statement issued around the time of his visit, he cautioned: \"All actors must comply with international humanitarian law. If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act.\"\n\nIsrael told the U.S. that it has information indicating that officials with the Palestinian Authority have been pressuring the ICC prosecutor to issue the warrants. Israeli officials warned their American counterparts that if this happens, they will consider the Palestinian Authority to be responsible and will take retaliatory steps against them that could cause their collapse. It is not known what specific actions they have in mind, but one possibility is freezing the transfer of the tax revenues that Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority, which would leave them bankrupt.\n\nAxios reports that a bipartisan group of senators recently met virtually with senior ICC officials to share their reservations about the potential arrest warrants. The issue also came up in a phone call between Netanyahu and President Biden over the weekend in which Biden reportedly insisted that the U.S. is opposed to ICC investigations against the Jewish State.\n\nOne U.S. official said: \"We are quietly encouraging the ICC not to do it. It will blow up everything. Israel will retaliate against the Palestinian Authority.\"", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even if we have to stand alone, we will continue to fight human evil,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nAsked by CNN for comment earlier this week on the possibility of arrest warrants being issued, the ICC said it \"does not give a running commentary in relation to ongoing investigations, nor does (it) respond to speculation in media reports. Accordingly, we have no further comment to make at this stage.\"\n\nIn a post on X in February, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said his office has \"an ongoing and active investigation into the situation in the State of Palestine,\" adding that his office was \"actively investigating any crimes allegedly committed. Those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable.\"\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court's jurisdiction. That has not previously stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nFatou Bensouda, a former ICC prosecutor, spent five years conducting a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" in which she concluded she was \"satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.\" But no arrests were made, and Bensouda left office in 2021.\n\nSince the Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7 that left 1,200 people dead and some 250 taken hostage, both Hamas and Israel have been accused of war crimes. Since Israel launched its devastating military response to that attack, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eyad_kourdi@cnn.com", "name": "Eyad Kourdi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yom HaShoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatou_Bensouda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatou Bensouda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(Brazil)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (Brazil)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bank"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c8772423-d7da-40fa-9f9a-bbd1a1150443.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538092", "eventUri": "eng-9538092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-18", "textStart": 81, "textEnd": 92}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2692, "textEnd": 2701}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) doubled down on the letter in a statement to The Hill on Monday.\n\n\"The credibility of the ICC is already suspect, which is why the United States would never yield to its authority,\" Cramer said. \"If they go forward with charging Israel's leadership with crimes for defending their citizens against terrorists, the ICC may as well declare themselves enemies of freedom.\"\n\nThe court shot back against unspecified threats in a public statement last week, a week after the GOP senators' letter was sent to the body.\n\n\"The Office seeks to engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever such dialogue is consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially,\" the ICC's Office of the Prosecutor said in a statement posted on the social platform X.\n\n\"That independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel should the Office, in fulfillment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction,\" the statement continues.\n\n\"Such threats, even when not acted upon, may also constitute an offence against the administration of justice under Art. 70 of the Rome Statute.\"\n\nPotential action against Israel comes after the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.

The ICC prosecutor has already hinted that arrest warrants against Hamas for the atrocities of October 7, 2013 are on the cards. It may not matter much to the leaders of Hamas if they cannot travel to the West since they cannot travel there anyway, but it is an indication that arrest warrants are being considered against both combatants.\n\nIsraeli Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the ICC cannot impede Israel's right to self-defence but if war crimes have been committed by individuals self-defence is of limited value to the perpetrators. The prosecutor has to examine the cases very carefully to ensure that criminal responsibility is not excluded by self-defence.\n\nThe ICC treaty preserves individual self-defence of oneself or another or even of essential property against imminent and unlawful attack provided it is proportionate. Crucially, however, being involved in defensive operations is not in itself a ground for excluding criminal responsibility.\n\nIsrael signed the ICC treaty in 2000, but it objected to some of its provisions that it believed were included to serve the political agenda of certain states so they could use the treaty as a political tool against Israel. Consequently Israel did not ratify the treaty and is not a state party.\n\nSo far as the ICC prosecutor is concerned, Israeli leaders can be prosecuted for alleged crimes in Gaza because they were committed in the territory of a state party - namely Palestine that became one in 2015 even though it is not a member state of the UN. And Hamas leaders are liable to be prosecuted for alleged war crimes on October 7 in Israel because they are nationals of Palestine.\n\nThe prosecutor is mindful of the need to avoid any suggestion that the ICC applies double standards and that he is beholden of the West. He cannot ignore clear evidence of war crimes against civilians in and around Gaza. If he sought and obtained an arrest warrant against President Vladimir Putin for the alleged crime of transporting or deporting Ukrainian children he must do the same for manifest war crimes in Gaza as the ICC has to be impartial and be seen to be impartial.\n\nAs a result of the warrant for his arrest Putin has been careful about where he travels and even avoided an important visit to South Africa just in case it's free thinking judicial system sought to execute the arrest warrant against him. So it appears that the the ICC can effective in holding leaders personally responsible for their policies.\n\nA decision to issue an arrest warrant is not entirely that of the ICC prosecutor. The decision requires the approval a pre trial court of three judges who have to be satisfied there are reasonable grounds the person to be arrested has committed an offence within the jurisdiction of the court and that the arrest of the person is necessary. The judges do not rubber stamp the decision of prosecutors to issue international arrest warrants as sometimes happens in some domestic jurisdictions. The court is required to evaluate the evidence and has to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe a person has committed a war crime and that it is necessary for him to be arrested - for example to prevent the commission of further war crimes.\n\nWhat Israeli leaders are worried about is that state parties of the ICC treaty would be obliged to cooperate with the prosecutor and execute arrest warrants issued by the court. The US is not a state party so there would be no worries about travelling there, but all the member states of the EU are state parties. And so are the UK, Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand all of which are countries that Israeli leaders may need to visit, which explains why there has been concern in Israel about the prospect of arrest warrants against its leaders.\n\nThe ICC is fiercely protective of its independence both from states and the UN and it may just be a coincidence that Karim Khan is actively considering arrest warrants against Israeli leaders at the same time as Netanyahu is actively considering an attack on Rafah near the Egyptian border where a million refugees have set up a tent city.\n\nHowever if an attack on Rafah does go ahead and a large number of innocent civilians are killed as both the US president and foreign minister and the UN Secretary General have predicted, Netanyahu would lay himself open to having an arrest warrant issued for war crimes against Rafah's civilian population.\n\nNormally, Netanyahu would take such a possibility in his stride but he is already facing charges of corruption in Israel and having an ICC arrest warrant for war crimes would be a prosecution that even he could not survive. In any case he needs to focus on getting the Israeli hostages released.", "source": {"uri": "cyprus-mail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cyprus Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Even if we have to stand alone, we will continue to fight human evil,\" Netanyahu added.\n\nAsked by CNN for comment earlier this week on the possibility of arrest warrants being issued, the ICC said it \"does not give a running commentary in relation to ongoing investigations, nor does (it) respond to speculation in media reports. Accordingly, we have no further comment to make at this stage.\"\n\nIn a post on X in February, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said his office has \"an ongoing and active investigation into the situation in the State of Palestine,\" adding that his office was \"actively investigating any crimes allegedly committed. Those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable.\"\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court's jurisdiction. That has not previously stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nFatou Bensouda, a former ICC prosecutor, spent five years conducting a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" in which she concluded she was \"satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.\" But no arrests were made, and Bensouda left office in 2021.\n\nSince the Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7 that left 1,200 people dead and some 250 taken hostage, both Hamas and Israel have been accused of war crimes. Since Israel launched its devastating military response to that attack, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Tom Cotton of Arkansas.\n\nJust over a week before the International Criminal Court issued a statement condemning threats against the institution, a dozen Republicans in the U.S. Senate sent a letter to the ICC's prosecutor warning him against pursuing charges against Israeli officials over war crimes committed in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe letter, dated April 24 and reported exclusively by Zeteo on Monday, explicitly threatens U.S. retaliation against the ICC if it issues arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or other top Israeli officials.\n\n\"Target Israel and we will target you,\" reads the letter, which was led by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a notorious war hawk, and signed by 11 others, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\n\nThe letter specifically threatens to sanction ICC employees and associates and bar them and their families from entering the United States, which is not a party to the ICC.\n\n\"You have been warned,\" states the letter, which invokes the American Service-Members' Protection Act -- a 2002 law informally known as \"The Hague Invasion Act.\"\n\nAs Zeteo explained, the law \"authorizes the U.S. president 'to use all means necessary and appropriate' to bring about the release not just of U.S. persons but also allies who are imprisoned or detained by the ICC.\"\n\nSen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.), who delivered the infamous GOP response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union Address earlier this year, told Zeteo that the letter is \"not a threat,\" but \"a promise.\"\n\nThe 12 Republicans sent their letter days before the office of ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan released a statement warning that its \"independence and impartiality are undermined... when individuals threaten to retaliate against the court or against court personnel\" as they conduct their investigations.\n\n\"Such threats, even when not acted upon, may also constitute an offense against the administration of justice under [Article] 70 of the Rome Statute,\" the statement added. \"The office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate, or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.\"\n\nWhile the ICC statement did not mention any individuals or governments by name, it is apparent that its message was directed at least in part at Republican lawmakers in the U.S.\n\nThe Biden White House and Netanyahu have also spoken out against the ICC amid reports that it is considering arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister and other senior officials.\n\n\"We've been really clear about the ICC investigation,\" White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters late last month. \"We do not support it. We don't believe that they have the jurisdiction. And I'm just gonna leave it there for now.\"\n\nSince October 7, Israeli forces have killed more than 34,600 people in Gaza -- a death toll that could surge if Israel moves ahead with its planned ground invasion of Rafah. Women and children account for up to 70% of those killed by Israel's military thus far.\n\nLike the U.S., Israel is not a party to the ICC, but the court says it has jurisdiction over the occupied Palestinian territories. In 2021, the ICC launched a probe into alleged war crimes in the territories, including Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [],

It would be an unprecedented antisemitic hate crime that would add fuel to the antisemitic incitement that is already raging in the world.\"\n\nHe appears to be at least somewhat worried about this possibility as he called on other world leaders to step up and take a stand against the ICC for investigating the Jewish state.\n\nHe said: \"Israel expects the leaders of the free world to come out strongly against this scandalous step, a step that will harm the self-defense not only of the State of Israel, but of all democracies.\"\n\nSo far, he seems to have the U.S. on his side, with the White House speaking out against both the ICJ's ruling that Israel is plausibly committing genocide in Gaza and the ICC's current investigation of Israel.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

The ICC has previously issued arrest warrants for world leaders such as Libya's Muammar Gaddafi, Uganda's Joseph Kony and Russia's Vladimir Putin.\n\nAlthough the ICC has not officially confirmed impending arrest warrants, Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan KC visited the occupied West Bank and Israel in December, meeting political leaders and victims' families to discuss their experiences. He condemned the violence on both sides and vowed to investigate.\n\nIn a statement issued around the time of his visit, he cautioned: \"All actors must comply with international humanitarian law. If you do not do so, do not complain when my office is required to act.\"\n\nIsrael told the U.S. that it has information indicating that officials with the Palestinian Authority have been pressuring the ICC prosecutor to issue the warrants. Israeli officials warned their American counterparts that if this happens, they will consider the Palestinian Authority to be responsible and will take retaliatory steps against them that could cause their collapse. It is not known what specific actions they have in mind, but one possibility is freezing the transfer of the tax revenues that Israel collects for the Palestinian Authority, which would leave them bankrupt.\n\nAxios reports that a bipartisan group of senators recently met virtually with senior ICC officials to share their reservations about the potential arrest warrants. The issue also came up in a phone call between Netanyahu and President Biden over the weekend in which Biden reportedly insisted that the U.S. is opposed to ICC investigations against the Jewish State.\n\nOne U.S. official said: \"We are quietly encouraging the ICC not to do it. It will blow up everything. Israel will retaliate against the Palestinian Authority.\"", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NaturalNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tom Cotton, warned in the letter. \"Such actions are illegitimate and lack legal basis, and, if carried out, will result in severe sanctions against you and your institution.\"\n\nSens. Mitch McConnell (minority leader), Rick Scott, Tim Scott, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio also signed the letter, amid increasing concern in Israel that the UN court could issue arrest warrants for senior political and military officials over the nearly-seven-month-old war in Gaza, including against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, and IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi.\n\nAs reports swirled of US and Israeli efforts to dissuade the court from issuing arrest orders, the ICC prosecutor said on Friday that, while the ICC \"welcomes open communication\" with government officials and non-governmental bodies alike, it will only engage in such dialogue so long as it is \"consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially.\"\n\n\"That independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate... should the office, in fulfillment of its mandate, make decisions about investigations or cases falling within its jurisdiction,\" he added, demanding that \"all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately.\"\n\nNevertheless, the senators charged in the letter that the ICC \"is attempting to punish Israel for taking legitimate actions of self-defense against their Iranian-backed aggressors. In fact, in your own words, you witnessed 'scenes of calculated cruelty' conducted by Hamas in Israel following the October 7 attacks.\"\n\nKhan visited Israel in December 2023 at the request of families of Hamas hostages. During his visit, he toured some of the communities attacked during the October 7 Hamas onslaught, including Kibbutz Be'eri and Kibbutz Kfar Aza, and heard testimonies from survivors of the massacre.\n\n\"These arrest warrants would align the ICC with the largest state sponsor of terrorism and its proxy. To be clear, there is no moral equivalence between Hamas's terrorism and Israel's justified response,\" the senators wrote.\n\nThe war in Gaza erupted after Hamas's October 7 massacre, which saw some 3,000 terrorists burst across the border into Israel by land, air and sea, killing some 1,200 people and seizing 252 hostages, mostly civilians, many amid acts of brutality and sexual assault.\n\nVowing to eliminate the terror group and return the hostages, Israel launched a wide-scale operation in Gaza that has come under international rebuke as the death toll mounts and UN bodies warn of looming famine.\n\nThe senators' letter also noted that the ICC is only allow to charge individuals from countries in which the government is \"unwilling or unable to police themselves.\"\n\n\"You yourself have said that 'Israel has trained lawyers who advise commanders and a robust system intended to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law.' By issuing warrants, you would be calling into question the legitimacy of Israel's laws, legal system, and democratic form of government,\" the senators wrote.\n\n\"If you move forward with the measures indicated in the report, we will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States,\" the letter stated. \"You have been warned.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, Israel has reportedly told the US that the Palestinian Authority may be pushing the court to issue the arrest warrants and warned that it would retaliate against the PA if they came to be.\n\nLast week, Axios reported that US Congress members from both parties had warned the ICC that Washington would also retaliate against the court, including by passing legislation that would sanction ICC officials, if it issues the potential warrants, amid fears that such a move could sink a hostages-for-truce agreement in the works between Israel and Hamas.", "source": {"uri": "timesofisrael.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of Israel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If you move forward with the measures indicated in the report, we will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States,\" read the April 24 letter made public on Monday. \"You have been warned.\"\n\nThe letter to ICC chief prosecutor Kraim Khan was led by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and McConnell and signed by Sens. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Katie Britt, R-Ala., Ted Budd, R-N.C., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Tim Scott, R-S.C. Rubio and Tim Scott are widely considered to be possible running mate picks by former President Donald Trump.\n\nKhan's office did not immediately return a request for comment, but denounced attempts to intimidate it last week.\n\nThe senators argued Israel's actions in Gaza are \"legitimate actions of self-defense\" against Hamas, who triggered the war with an Oct. 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that killed around 1,200 and led to the abduction of around 250 hostages. They also said penalizing Israel would undermine the country's legal system and questioned why the ICC has not issued arrest warrants for Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Syrian President Bashar al Assad, Hamas leaders or Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"To be clear, there is no moral equivalence between Hamas's terrorism and Israel's justified response,\" the senators wrote.\n\nWhat the ICC is or is not investigating remains nonpublic for now, but opponents of Israel's war effort in Gaza have labeled it a genocide, pointing to the cut off of humanitarian aid into an enclave that the U.N. says is experiencing \"full-blown famine,\" as well as the destruction of schools, hospitals and cultural sites, and the killings of at least 34,735 people, around two-thirds of whom are women and children, according to local health officials.\n\nOn Monday, experts at the U.N. \"condemned the continued and systematic onslaught of violence committed against Palestinians in Gaza, with most victims being women and children over the past seven months.\" They said over 390 bodies have been found in mass graves at Gazan hospitals, \"including of women and children, with many reportedly showing signs of torture and summary executions, and potential instances of people buried alive.\"\n\nThe ICC, which officially launched in 2002 at The Hague, is charged with investigating genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and the crime of aggression. As a \"court of last resort,\" its mandate is to step in and prosecute governments and individuals when countries' judicial systems are unable to act, though it has no enforcement mechanism. While 124 states have signed onto the Rome Statute that empowers the ICC, the U.S., Israel, Russia and China are among the dozens of countries who have not. The State of Palestine, which is recognized by 139 U.N. member states but not the U.N. itself or the United States, signed onto the statue in 2015.\n\nThe court has not announced charges or detailed any investigations connected to the Israel-Hamas war, but issued a statement last week as pressure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other top U.S. and Israeli officials mounted over reports the ICC was considering issuing arrest warrants.\n\n\"The Office of the Prosecutor is aware that there is a significant public interest in its investigations, and it... seeks to engage constructively with all stakeholders whenever such dialogue is consistent with its mandate under the Rome Statute to act independently and impartially,\" Khan's office said. \"That independence and impartiality are undermined, however, when individuals threaten to retaliate against the Court or against Court personnel.\"\n\nThe statement noted it was a violation of international law to threaten retaliation against ICC officials or to attempt to prevent them from performing their duties.\n\n\"The Office insists that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence its officials cease immediately,\" the statement concluded.\n\nIn remarks last week, Netanyahu called the potential warrants \"an outrage of historic proportions\" and that he \"expects the leaders of the free world... to use all the means at their disposal to stop this dangerous move.\" Johnson in a statement called the reports \"disgraceful\" and urged President Joe Biden to \"use every available tool to prevent such an abomination.\" On Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration opposes \"any threats or intimidation to public officials,\" but that the president does not \"support this investigative probe. We do not believe it's within their jurisdiction.\"\n\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry said late Sunday that it had informed missions abroad of \"rumors\" that the court could order the arrest of senior Israeli political and military officials. The ministry did not give a source for the rumors.\n\nKhan visited Ramallah and Israel in December, meeting Palestinian officials and families of Israelis killed or taken hostage by Hamas militants in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nKhan called Hamas' actions \"some of the most serious international crimes that shock the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was established to address,\" and called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.\n\nKhan said \"international humanitarian law must still apply\" in the Israel-Hamas war and \"the Israeli military knows the law that must be applied.\" After the visit, Khan said an ICC investigation into possible crimes by Hamas militants and Israeli forces \"is a priority for my office.\"\n\nIn 2020, then-President Trump slapped economic and travel sanctions on the ICC prosecutor and another senior prosecution office staffer. The ICC staff were looking into U.S. and allies' troops and intelligence officials for possible war crimes in Afghanistan.\n\nBiden, whose administration has provided crucial military and political support for the Gaza offensive, lifted the sanctions in 2021.\n\nThe ICC has 17 ongoing investigations, has issued a total of 42 arrest warrants and taken 21 suspects into custody. Its judges have convicted 10 suspects and acquitted four.\n\nIn its early years, the court was criticized for focusing on crimes in Africa -- 10 of its investigations are in African nations -- but now it has investigations in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\nIn March 2023, after the court issued a warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin on charges of responsibility for the abductions of children from Ukraine, Russia responded by issuing its own arrest warrants for Khan and ICC judges.

Even if we have to stand alone, we will continue to fight human evil,\" Netanyahu said in a fiery speech Sunday at the opening ceremony of Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n\nNetanyahu's comments came shortly before Israel on Monday ordered Palestinians in parts of Rafah to evacuate, after the country's defense minister told troops in Gaza to expect \"intense action\" in the city \"in the near future.\" More than 1 million Palestinians have been displaced to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of most of the north of the strip.\n\nWhile negotiators in Egypt struggle to strike a ceasefire-for-hostages deal between Israel and Hamas - which could see as many as 33 Israeli hostages released in exchange for a pause in the fighting that has raged for nearly seven months - Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from the extreme wing of his coalition to prioritize entering Rafah to attempt to destroy Hamas.\n\nNetanyahu also warned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague against issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders and commanders after its investigation into the war in Gaza. Israeli media has reported that several government officials, including Netanyahu, are concerned that such arrest warrants are imminent.\n\nIssuing arrest warrants for Israeli officials would leave an \"indelible stain\" on the edifice of international law and justice, Netanyahu said. He stressed that the ICC was \"founded as a consequence of the Holocaust\" and should not attempt to \"undermine\" Israel's fundamental right to self-defense.\n\nNetanyahu's comments may represent Israel's growing isolation, as some of its closest allies have attempted to dissuade him from launching an incursion into Rafah.\n\nIn a phone call late last month, United States President Joe Biden reiterated to Netanyahu his \"clear position\" on a potential Israeli invasion of Rafah, according to a White House readout. The Biden administration has made clear to its Israeli counterparts that it wants to see a clear and actionable plan on how they would protect civilians in Rafah.\n\nAsked by CNN for comment earlier this week on the possibility of arrest warrants being issued, the ICC said it \"does not give a running commentary in relation to ongoing investigations, nor does (it) respond to speculation in media reports. Accordingly, we have no further comment to make at this stage.\"\n\nIn a post on X in February, ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan said his office has \"an ongoing and active investigation into the situation in the State of Palestine,\" adding that his office was \"actively investigating any crimes allegedly committed. Those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable.\"\n\nIsrael is not a member of the ICC and rejects the court's jurisdiction. That has not previously stopped the court from investigating its actions in the occupied Palestinian territories.\n\nFatou Bensouda, a former ICC prosecutor, spent five years conducting a \"painstaking preliminary examination\" in which she concluded she was \"satisfied that war crimes have been or are being committed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.\" But no arrests were made, and Bensouda left office in 2021.\n\nSince the Hamas terror attack on Israel on October 7 that left 1,200 people dead and some 250 taken hostage, both Hamas and Israel have been accused of war crimes. Since Israel launched its devastating military response to that attack, more than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That's not true.Allie Wong | Opinion contributor\n\nTuesday night, two dozen Columbia University students linked arms in front of the student-occupied Hamilton Hall at dusk. I was one of them.\n\nWe sang with broken yet mighty voices, \"Your people are my people, your people are mine; your people are my people, our struggles align.\" We were a group of activists of differing faiths and none, friends and strangers united, linking arms with one another and, in spirit, with the generations of courageous students who came before us. Electricity crackled through the air from the growing protests echoing just beyond the university gates - gates I had just moments ago slipped through and sprinted from like a bat out of hell.\n\nWe knew we were likely to be arrested for being on campus despite the university-mandated shelter-in-place order, but chose we to run into the fire anyway.\n\nAs a human chain, draped in keffiyehs and shaking like leaves in the autumn wind, we sang with hushed tones and breathed deeply as hundreds of New York police officers armed with flash grenades and pepper spray marched toward us like a military parade.\n\nAs they approached from multiple directions, we sang with frail and cracking voices, \"This love that I have, the world didn't give it to me; the world didn't give it, the world can't take it away,\" as officers threatened student journalists with arrest, presumably to ensure minimal coverage of the aggression they were about to exert.\n\nStudents in dorms craned their necks and shakily stretched their iPhones out windows to observe the impending attack.\n\nWe clung tighter to one another as they approached us, and seized us like rag dolls and slammed us into the hallowed ground of brick and concrete. But unlike rag dolls, we bleed, we crack, we bruise, we feel.\n\nView |58 PhotosStudents at Columbia University protest the Israel-Hamas warColumbia University restricted campus access and began suspending students involved in Gaza war protests.Police at Columbia were anything but professional\n\nOnce dispersed, I held my hands up to show I was neither resisting nor armed. In response, I was handled brutally by police alongside other students being shoved down concrete steps saying with shameless condescension, \"Watch your step.\" We were arrested, bound and shuttled down to 1 Police Plaza, where the New York Police Department had a pizza party prepared for arresting officers.\n\nThey threw us in cells like animals - cells where the only toilets women could use lacked any privacy and where our naked bodies were in plain sight to throngs of male officers.\n\nWhy are we protesting? College students are telling you exactly how they feel about the Israel-Hamas war. Listen.\n\nDuring news conference hours later, New York Mayor Eric Adams said there were no incidents of violence. This is an abhorrent lie. Later on Wednesday, in an email sent to the entire university community, Columbia President Minouche Shafik thanked the NYPD for their \"professionalism.\" This supposed professionalism is also a lie.\n\nWhat is nonviolent and professional about seizing a compliant 120-pound student with her hands up and slamming her to the concrete ground? What is nonviolent and professional about brutalizing students? What is professional about removing a woman's hijab during police bookings and refusing to return it - yet offering me, a non-Muslim, my vest because the jail cell was cold? What is professional about forcing women to expose their genitalia to male officers in order to use the toilet because we \"trespassed\" on our own university?\n\nWe sang \"Like a tree planted by the waters, we shall not be moved\" as our bodies were seized - but we would not be moved.\n\nProtesters aren't antisemitic. Our hearts are with innocent Gazans.\n\nOur hearts are with Gaza, our resolve is stronger than ever, and we hope the world sees the brutality of the police against peaceful protesters, at the behest of our own university president.\n\nBut make no mistake, we are not the heroes of this story - that honor belongs to those in Gaza; those whose families have been starved, whose cities have been bombed, whose children have been slaughtered; and those who did not have the privilege of choosing arrest or offering their bodies up as a public relations sacrifice.\n\nGen Z supports Palestinians: Gen Z wants no part of Biden's unceasing support of Israel as civilian deaths in Gaza mount\n\nNor are we villains - those are the perpetrators of slaughter, such as Minouche Shafik and the Board of Trustees who would rather beat and arrest students than divest from a foreign government committing genocide.\n\nOn Saturday, I hosted a Passover Seder at my cramped Manhattan apartment for many of my closest friends. Representing many faiths and none, we broke bread together and celebrated the Jewish liberation from slavery and a broken, unjust system of oppression.\n\nOn Tuesday I was shackled and arrested as part of the campus movement that many in the news media are calling \"antisemitic.\" It isn't.\n\nCritically, our fellow Jewish students are not the villains in this story. They are our friends, our family, our blood, our fellow foot soldiers. Like us, they bleed, they crack, they bruise, they feel. At no point have the student organizers called for or promoted violence against our Jewish brothers and sisters. We are calling to end the violence and genocide against our Palestinian brothers and sisters.\n\nAllie Wong PROVIDED PHOTO\n\nI chose to risk arrest because - unlike many of my classmates and friends - I'm privileged enough not to face deportation; because my potential suspension - and any other consequences that may befall me - does not even register on the scale of suffering experienced by those for whom we sing, whose lives have been taken, whose children have been slaughtered, whose families are being starved and tortured - those whom Columbia University is complicit in killing.\n\nWe are not the heroes, nor are we the villains - the latter category belongs to Columbia and the broken system it refuses to heal.\n\nAllie Wong is a Ph.D. student at Columbia University.

Since Israel is neither a signatory to nor does it recognize the ICC, leaders of the Jewish state claim their territory is off limits when it comes to international law.\n\nIn a video he released earlier this week, Netanyahu personally condemned the ICC's efforts to deliver justice to him and his cabinet, calling the move \"an outrage of historic proportions.\"\n\n\"Branding Israel's leaders and soldiers as war criminals will pour jet fuel on the fires of antisemitism,\" Netanyahu said, emphasizing that Israel does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC.\n\nNetanyahu would further state in his video address that he believes the ICC is attempting to \"paralyze Israel's very ability to defend itself.\n\nThe United States, by the way, is not a party to the ICC either, which is very convenient as the U.S. functions as the war arm of Zionist Israel.\n\nNetanyahu says he will not back down in finishing the mission he started. The Israeli army, he revealed, will not stop bombing and attacking Gaza until Hamas is fully neutralized to the point \"that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.\"\n\nBack in January, the United Nations (UN) International Court of Justice (ICJ) announced that, based on the evidence it has reviewed, it is entirely \"plausible\" that the IFD's actions in Gaza amount to genocide. The ICJ is in the process of reviewing a case brought forth by South Africa accusing Israel of war crimes.\n\nIn response to that legal proceeding, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the allegations \"atrocious and preposterous,\" denying any wrongdoing of the IDF in Gaza.\n\nAs of this writing, there are more than 34,000 confirmed deaths in Gaza caused by the IDF, many of these women and children.\n\n\"The ICC needs to issue warrants on the Biden administration as well because without America's 'aid,' this genocide would not have taken place,\" wrote a commenter at RT about the matter.\n\n\"It is interesting to note that war criminals say that the ICC does not apply to them but that it does to Russia's actions in Ukraine.\"\n\nAnother wrote that Zionism at its core stems from Jewish deviance, i.e., those from the Old Testament who were condemned for worshiping the golden calf.\n\n\"How many Jews have been deceived and led into error by this Satanic movement?\" this person further asked.\n\nSomeone else added to the conversation that all the lies and propaganda in the world will never change the fact that what Israel is doing in Gaza amounts to genocide, plain and simple.", "source": {"uri": "thepeoplesvoice.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "The People's Voice"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_adl_tabatabai@thepeoplesvoice.tv", "name": "Sean Adl-Tabatabai",

He said that the warrants would be \"unprecedented antisemitic hate crime\" which would further fuel antisemitism in the world.\n\nNetanyahu's comments come amid reports that Israeli leaders have been alarmed in recent days that warrants could be issued against them. The warrants pertain to Israeli actions related to the Palestinians over the past three years and in the ongoing war in Gaza as well. Besides Netanyahu, those expected to be indicted include Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and Israeli military's Chief-of-Staff Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi.\n\n'Even if Israel is forced to stand alone, we will stand alone'\n\nNetanyahu said that Israel will stand alone and defend itself if it has to.\n\nSpeaking at the Holocaust Remembrance Day ceremony at the Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said that Jews are again facing threats of destruction today.\n\n\"If Israel is forced to stand alone, Israel will stand alone&mldr;Today, we again confront enemies bent on our destruction&mldr;I say to the leaders of the world, no amount of pressure, no decision by any international forum, will stop Israel from defending itself,\" said Netanyahu, as per AFP.\n\nNetanyahu further said that any warrants against Israeli leaders would be \"distortion of justice and history\". He said the ICC was founded as a consequence of the Holocaust and now it should not undermine the fundamental right of Israel of self-defence.\n\nThe Holocaust refers to the systematic killing of more than 6 million Jews in Europe during the World War II by the Nazi Germany.\n\nPreviously, Netanyahu had said that the ICC's actions against Israel \"will pour jet fuel on the fires of antisemitism\".\n\n\"Branding Israel's leaders and soldiers as war criminals will pour jet fuel on the fires of antisemitism. Those fires that are already raging on the campuses of America and across capitals around the world,\" said Netanyahu, as per The Jerusalem Post.\n\nWhat we know of ICC's action against Israel\n\nFormally, the ICC has not yet commented on reports that arrest warrants are expected against Israeli leaders.\n\nReports, however, have said that Israeli leaders have been alarmed lately that arrest warrants against them are imminent. Netanyahu has reportedly raised the issue with US President Joe Biden and US senators have also taken up the issue with the ICC.\n\nWhite House has said that it does not support an ICC probe.\n\n\"We've been really clear about the ICC investigation, that we don't support it, we don't believe that they have the jurisdiction,\" said White House Press Secretary Karine

Since Israel is neither a signatory to nor does it recognize the ICC, leaders of the Jewish state claim their territory is off limits when it comes to international law.\n\n(Related: ICC investigators are interviewing staff at hospitals in Gaza to gather evidence of Israeli war crimes.)\n\nNetanyahu lashes out against ICC\n\nIn a video he released earlier this week, Netanyahu personally condemned the ICC's efforts to deliver justice to him and his cabinet, calling the move \"an outrage of historic proportions.\"\n\n\"Branding Israel's leaders and soldiers as war criminals will pour jet fuel on the fires of antisemitism,\" Netanyahu said, emphasizing that Israel does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

The Israeli army, he revealed, will not stop bombing and attacking Gaza until Hamas is fully neutralized to the point \"that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again.\"\n\nBack in January, the United Nations (UN) International Court of Justice (ICJ) announced that, based on the evidence it has reviewed, it is entirely \"plausible\" that the IFD's actions in Gaza amount to genocide. The ICJ is in the process of reviewing a case brought forth by South Africa accusing Israel of war crimes.\n\nIn response to that legal proceeding, Israeli President Isaac Herzog called the allegations \"atrocious and preposterous,\" denying any wrongdoing of the IDF in Gaza.\n\nAs of this writing, there are more than 34,000 confirmed deaths in Gaza caused by the IDF, many of these women and children.\n\n\"The ICC needs to issue warrants on the Biden administration as well because without America's 'aid,' this genocide would not have taken place,\" wrote a commenter at RT about the matter.\n\n\"It is interesting to note that war criminals say that the ICC does not apply to them but that it does to Russia's actions in Ukraine.\"\n\nAnother wrote that Zionism at its core stems from Jewish deviance, i.e., those from the Old Testament who were condemned for worshiping the golden calf.\n\n\"How many Jews have been deceived and led into error by this Satanic movement?\" this person further asked.\n\nSomeone else added to the conversation that all the lies and propaganda in the world will never change the fact that what Israel is doing in Gaza amounts to genocide, plain and simple.\n\nThe latest news about what's going on in the Middle East can be found at WWIII.news.", "source": {"uri": "therussophile.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheRussophiles"}, "authors":

The sources refused to provide further details, and the ICC prosecutor's office declined to comment on the operational aspect of the probe, citing concerns over the safety of witnesses and victims.\n\nThe ICC has said it is investigating both sides of the conflict.\n\nIn November, Al-Shifa Hospital was invaded by the Israeli army, who evacuated its staff at gunpoint and turned the facility into a detention center. The hospital was attacked again on 18 March, and hundreds were killed in a subsequent two-week Israeli operation inside and around the medical center.\n\nKhan Yunis' Al-Nasser hospital was also stormed by Israeli troops in February. Several people were killed, including patients.\n\nPalestinian rescue workers demanded urgent probes and international intervention following this month's discovery of hundreds of bodies - many unidentifiable - buried in mass graves near the two hospitals.\n\nSome of the bodies found showed signs of torture and execution.

target you': Republicans tell ICC over warrants", "body": "A group of US Republicans has sent stark warnings to the International Criminal Court over reports that it intended to issue warrants against Israeli officials over the war in Gaza, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n\"Target Israel and we will target you,\" reads a letter from Republicans in Congress addressed to prosecutor Karim Khan at the ICC.\n\n\"If you move forward with the measures indicated in the report, we will move to end all American support for the ICC, sanction your employees and associates, and bar you and your families from the United States.\"\n\nThe letter, sent late last month, was first reported on Monday by Zeteo news.\n\nSignatories included Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, and Tom Cotton, a far-right senator.\n\nReports began circulating in April that the UN court may issue arrest warrants for Mr Netanyahu, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and military chief of staff Herzi Halevi.\n\nWashington was quick to respond to those reports, and Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson told reporters last week that President Joe Biden's administration was advising the court to \"stand down\".\n\nThis puts Mr Biden in a tricky position.\n\nWhen he assumed the presidency he revoked a Donald Trump-era executive order that imposed sanctions on ICC officials and visa restrictions on the court's personnel.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken called those restrictions \"inappropriate and ineffective.\"\n\n\"Reimposing the same or similar sanctions to protest the ICC's work on a specific situation would send the message that powerful states can work to block geopolitically unfavourable investigations,\" said Celeste Kmiotek, a staff lawyer for the Strategic Litigation Project at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\"If the US efforts ultimately prevent arrest warrants, it will not only exacerbate the hurdles the ICC already faces in terms of resources and jurisdictional limitations that prevent it from holding certain states accountable, but will also lend additional credence to the claims of double standards.\"\n\nAs for revoking Washington's support of the ICC, that assistance is quite limited, Ms Kmiotek says.\n\nA US law already bars Washington from providing any support to the ICC, although Congress passed limited exceptions allowing the US to support the ICC's investigation in Ukraine.\n\nAnd in July 2023 Mr Biden ordered the US government to share evidence of Russian war crimes with the court.\n\n\"Tangibly, then, the US can only withdraw that limited co-operation related to Ukraine,\" said Ms Kmiotek.\n\nIsrael does not recognise the ICC's authority, but issuing warrants would mean that the 124 countries signed up to the body are obliged to arrest Israeli officials if they enter their territory.\n\nWashington is not a signatory of the ICC's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, despite having taken part in negotiations to create the court.\n\nBut the fact that many US allies are party to the statute could complicate things for Washington, says Ms Kmiotek.\n\n\"This will undoubtedly affect how US allies view Netanyahu and the US diplomatic efforts regarding Israel - potentially delegitimising future plans and eroding remaining support for Netanyahu,\" she added.\n\nIsrael and the US were among only seven countries to vote against the 1998 Rome Statute, alongside China, Iraq, Libya, Qatar and Yemen.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In fact, until recently, the ICC has appeared to be quite biased in who it chooses to prosecute, focusing on the crimes committed in certain regions whilst completely ignoring the same atrocities elsewhere.\n\nIn spite of this little bit of progress, it is questionable whether the ICC will be able to proceed in this vein. The very inception of the court came with heavy influence from the powers that be in the West. As the Rome Statute was being written, legal representation was dominated by European and North American influence. Additionally, the United States is ostensibly exempt from being brought before the court.\n\nIn 2002, the United States passed a law commonly referred to as The Hague Invasion Act, which gives it the unilateral right to invade The Hague should an American be indicted by the ICC. And now Israel, being in league with the United States, is seemingly protected as well.\n\nRegarding the current Israel-Palestine conflict, the United States has demanded that Israel not be prosecuted for the crimes it is committing, hinting at the fact that the Hague Invasion Act could be triggered in defence of Israel. International law seems to be held at the behest of Uncle Sam.\n\nIt is telling that even compassionate Zionists, whilst asserting their right to defend the State of Israel, are able to point out the excesses of the Israeli government in general, and Netanyahu in particular. The ICC must also show honesty and bravery as it investigates the crimes being committed in Gaza. It would be unfair to the rest of the world to witness the ICC backing down and continuing to maintain its focus only on countries that cannot retaliate against it for exercising its mandate.\n\nAs well, this would be proof that international law does not function as a fair arbiter for all; the fact that the International Court of Justice has been wholly ignored has already pointed towards this fact, and the ICC dropping this case would be further proof. Already, the United States managed to avert the eyes of the court from investigating possible war crimes committed by American troops in Afghanistan by threatening to invade The Hague. Dropping the investigation on the genocide and war crimes committed by Israel would be the final nail in the coffin, confirming the bias of the ICC once and for all.\n\nStates also need to consider a reworking of international law or else explore alternative actions should they feel that they are unable to change the current state of affairs. As the general population continues to hold protests against this genocide across the globe, their governments also need to take a moral stand on this matter.\n\nAlready, Bolivia has severed all diplomatic ties with Israel, and a few other countries including Chile, South Africa and Chad have recalled their ambassadors from Israel. As a show of solidarity with the people of Palestine, more states ought to take up this charge as well as consider more severe punitive measures to send the message to Israel that this war is unwarranted.\n\nKenya, whilst remaining fairly neutral and sometimes voting in favour of Israel at the United Nations General Assembly, has shown some bravery in voting against the United States and Israel and demanding a ceasefire. This is an excellent start, but still more ought to be done to send a message to Israel that we do not support the ongoing genocide.\n\nWhilst the consequences of cutting off diplomatic ties with Israel may be huge, it is at this point a necessary measure that would set the ball rolling.

The Act also establishes that those protections should be defended regarding officials of allies of the US, in this case, as established in the letter, Israeli senior officials.\n\nLeitner said, \"In accordance with the strong alliance between the United States and Israel, we urge President Biden to employ his authority and moral determination in demanding that the ICC drop any intent to pursue legal action against Israeli and IDF officials.

John Fetterman (D-Penn.), another Zionist who believes that Israel is some kind of moral paragon that is above the law.\n\nThen we have House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) who called the ICC's investigation \"baseless and illegitimate,\" claiming any prosecution of Israel war crimes will jeopardize U.S. national security.\n\nThe Israeli government isn't used to having people publicly oppose its villainous behavior on the world stage.

(res.) Pnina Sharvit Baruch said that any serious probe by Israel would be a move in the right direction.\n\nTo date, the only probe the IDF has said it will publicize is its review of the October 7 failure to stop Hamas's invasion.\n\nAlthough in January-March, the IDF legal division started to move forward with accelerating some legal probes, there is no deadline yet for publicizing even some initial findings.\n\nSo far, Israel seems to be hoping that diplomatic pressure from the US will slow the ICC war crimes arrest warrants and probe.", "source": {"uri": "jpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jerusalem Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkel_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkel Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Criminal Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jerusalem_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Jerusalem Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Turkel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Turkel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Bet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shin Bet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Weinstein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yehuda Weinstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://images.jpost.com/image/upload/f_auto,fl_lossy/c_fill,g_faces:center,h_407,w_690/545402", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538092", "eventUri": "eng-9538092", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2725, "textEnd": 2734}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

US police have arrested over 2,300 student protesters, and many more will be arrested in the coming weeks. We should congratulate the moral courage of these students.\n\nEdward Luce reminds Americans about their foolhardiness. He wrote: \"America is in knots over the foolishness -- or worse -- of its campus protesters. But it is the adults who are making the biggest dunces of themselves. The role of the grown-ups facing student unrest is to keep the peace without sacrificing rights. These include free speech and physical safety. The task requires principled consistency.\" (Financial Times, May 2.)\n\nThese students watched Hamas's horrendous killing of over 1,200 Israelis and Israel's savage revenge. Israel has killed over 34,500 Palestinians, mostly women and children, and injured over 73,000 Palestinians over the past six months. Israel has destroyed their hospitals, laid waste 70% of Palestinian land, and sent 1.5 million people looking for shelter in Rafah.\n\nIsrael is making preparations to storm Rafah to kill a few more thousand Palestinians and the remnants of Hamas fighters who remain there. Last Sunday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared: \"We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there -- with or without a deal [on a ceasefire], in order to achieve total victory.\"\n\nThese young people, particularly university students, have witnessed the inhumanity of Hamas and Israel. They know that Netanyahu and his right-wing government are responsible for the genocide of Palestinians. Yet, they realise they are the conscience of their adults and even their university leaders.\n\nThey watch these so-called champions of demo\u00adcracy (the US and Germany, particularly) talk about human rights out of one side of their mouths while they provide the arms and ammunitions to kill, maim and displace a people from their homeland.\n\nThe US government is the prime contributor of arms and ammunition to Israel. Each year it contributes about $3.8 billion to Israel's military budget. Since November of last year it contributed about $45 billion to Israel ($14.5 billion in November 2023; $14 billion in February 2024; and $17 billion last week.) Germany contributed $350 million worth of weaponry to Israel this year, \"a tenfold increase on 2022 exports, most of which was approved after the Hamas attack on Israel\" (Al Jazeera, March 18, 2024). Australia, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom also supplied Israel with weapons to annihilate the Palestinians.\n\nAll of these countries are in breach of the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide which stipulates that they work to prevent the occurrence of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. It defines genocide as \"any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group\" and prohibits a country from exporting weapons to any state it suspects might use them \"for genocide, crimes, and against humanity\".\n\nIn January the South African government accused Israel of genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and asked the court to order Israel to halt its military campaign in Gaza. On January 26 the court ordered Israel to adopt \"provisional measures\" to prevent genocide against Palestinians and to enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance to the people of Gaza. Balkees Jarrah, associate international director at Human Rights Watch, remarked: \"The World Court's landmark decision puts Israel and its allies on notice that immediate action is needed to prevent genocide and further atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the BBC reported that \"Israeli officials are increasingly concerned that the International Criminal Court (ICC) is planning to seek arrest warrants for their military and political leaders on suspicion of war crimes. Reports suggest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be among them.\" Previously, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin (Russia), Moammar Gadaffi (Libya) and Joseph Kony, a Ugandan warlord.\n\nThe ICC has also weighed in against Hamas's atrocities. Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan, KC, of the ICC who visited the area (he toured Israeli villages where Hamas-led gunmen attacked on October 7), declared: \"All actors must comply with international humanitarian law.\" (BBC) Hamas, he said, had conducted \"some of the most serious international crimes that shook the conscience of humanity, crimes which the ICC was \u00adestablished to address\".\n\nInstitutions of higher learning in the US are concerned about the anti-Semitic statements of some of the students in the pro-Palestinian protests without even mentioning their condemnation of Israeli atrocities. The latter is never mentioned in any discussion about the students' demands. How can anti-Semitic statements, as vile as they are, be compared with the genocide in Gaza and the threat of more killing in Rafah?\n\nThe US media should stop being the propaganda mouthpiece of Israel; the US government should cease being the major supplier of arms and ammunition to Israel. It is morally blind to penalise those who struggle for justice but reward those who promote genocidal behaviour. Such double standards undermine the integrity of the leaders of US higher education.\n\nPresident Joseph Biden offered a pathetic response to this crisis: \"We're a civil society and order must prevail.\" Frederick Douglass's injunction seems more relevant: \"Power concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.\" Students understand this logic instinctively.\n\n-- Prof Cudjoe's e-mail address is scudjoe@wellesley.edu.

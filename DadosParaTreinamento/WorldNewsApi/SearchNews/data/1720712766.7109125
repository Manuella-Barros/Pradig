According to photos obtained by Page Six, the bikini-clad \u201cEuphoria\u201d actress was seen enjoying time on the water behind her new $13.5 million Florida estate on Friday. Sweeney, 26, rode an inflatable banana boat with a friend while they were being pulled by a jet ski and she spent time laying out on a paddle board with her dog. Her fianc\u00e9, Jonathan Davino, also joined Sweeney for a little fun in the sun. The \u201cAnyone But You\u201d star stunned in a black-and-white sunflower-printed bikini and a pair of dark shades. The outing comes days after Sweeney snagged the property in the Florida Keys for $13.5 million \u2014 $4.5 million less than its asking price. The 7,720-square-foot home features six bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a chef\u2019s kitchen, a 520-bottle wine room, a 330-gallon aquarium, an elevator, a home gym, a game room and carport parking. It also includes a massive heated and chilled infinity pool with a swim-up bar, a hot tub and a private boat launch. Page Six obtained exclusive pics of the pricey pad, which is located on a large piece of land 30 minutes from Key West, Fla. After purchasing the home, Sweeney also dished out nearly $70,000 for a new beach vehicle. A rep for the Hampton Jollys told us the \u201cImmaculate\u201d star bought the Fiat 500 Jolly, which is a cross between a golf cart and a dune buggy, Though the cruiser comes in 10 different colors, Sweeney opted for the sky blue vehicle. Aside from her Florida home, the actress also owns a $3 million Tudor-style home in California, which she bought in 2021. \u201cI always thought that when I turned 18, I\u2019d have all this money and I\u2019d buy back my parents\u2019 house and put them all back together again. And I never was able to, and I never did,\u201d she told the Associated Press in December 2021. \u201cSo now being able to be in a house is such an incredible, humbling, amazing accomplishment that I still can\u2019t believe I was able to pull off.\u201d", "summary": "According to photos obtained by Page Six, the \"Euphoria\" actress was seen enjoying time on the water behind her new $13.5 million Florida estate.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/09/lifestyle/bikini-clad-sydney-sweeney-rides-banana-boat-at-her-new-13-5m-florida-estate/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/83532151.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/zzn4n4lY-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:00:00", "author": "Tamantha Ryan", "authors": ["Tamantha Ryan"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.05}

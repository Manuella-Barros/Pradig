There are still some top players on the board, but there will be no more subtractions by teams until the winter cycle begins in December. That means for teams like the Miami football team, it's only about addition from here on out.\n\nAs with any transfer portal cycle, there were some teams that, even though they may have suffered a loss of players, in the end, they may have come out better with new talent. We're going to look at a few of these teams, who we're calling the winners of the college football spring transfer portal.\n\nMiami Hurricanes\n\nHead coach Mario Cristobal and the Miami Hurricanes football team, by the looks of things, were on a mission during this cycle, making them winner in the college football spring transfer portal. Though this was the biggest talent crop, the Canes took a lot of the top pieces, including the No. 1 running back in Oregon State's Damien Martinez. The former Beaver was one of the top rushers in the country last season and will give Miami a huge boost in their running game they may not have seen in years.\n\nWith Martinez comes Houston wide receiver Sam Brown, who was a top 10 receiver in the Big 12 last season. They'll join winter transfer addition quarterback Cam Ward, making what could be a lethal offense in Coral Gables. Other notable pieces were Louisville linebacker Jaylin Alderman, Marshall cornerback Dyoni Hill, and Michigan State defensive tackle Simeon Barrow Jr., who replaces Jared Harrison-Hunte in the portal. As good as these five incoming transfers are, it may not be all for the Canes.\n\nAuburn Tigers\n\nHead coach Hugh Freeze and the Auburn football team will be bringing in six new transfers from the college football spring transfer portal window, and they were all much needed. Outside of finding a quarterback to give competition to Payton Thorne, the Auburn football team went out instead to get the signal-caller some help with hopes of bolstering the offense.\n\nFormer Penn State wide receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith was one of the more coveted receivers during this cycle. He was the Nittany Lions' leading receiver last season, with 53 catches for 673 yards and four touchdowns. Lambert-Smith now joins freshman Cam Coleman and winter portal addition Robert Lewis out of Georgia State, who I called the Tigers' sneakiest portal get.\n\nBut where Auburn football really focused was on improving their defensive front. They have three linemen in Arkansas State's Keyron Crawford, USC's Isaiah Raikes, and Indiana's Philip Blidi. These added pieces, to go along with their previous additions, could make the Tigers a bit of a threat in the SEC this upcoming season and fellow winners of the college football spring transfer portal.\n\nUCF Golden Knights\n\nAre the Golden Knights getting ready to take over the Big 12? With the losses of Texas and Oklahoma, it's anyone's game in 2024. To help their chances, UCF made a big splash by landing four-star running back Peny Boone, who was the 2023 MAC Offensive Player of the Year, and Ohio receiver Jacoby Jones. Boone and Jones will now be alongside Arkansas transfer quarterback KJ Jefferson from the winter cycle, making head coach Gus Malzahn likely a happy man.\n\nUCF was also able to snag Miami's four-star edge Nyjalik Kelly, plus secondary players in USC's Tre'Quan Fegans, Ohio State's Cedrick Hawkins, and East Tennessee State's Sheldon Arnold.\n\nColorado Buffaloes\n\nFor a while, head coach Deion Sanders and the Colorado football team were looking like the biggest of losers in the spring transfer portal cycle. They lost a whopping 29 transfers. But what seems to be the norm now in Boulder, Sanders and the Colorado football team recovered rather nicely, giving the team yet another makeover and making them winners during the college football spring transfer portal.\n\nColorado landed 10 new additions to their roster, making for a total of 38 incoming transfers from both cycles. Emphasis was obviously focused on improving both offensive and defensive lines, with six of the 10 transfers coming from those positions. Four-star Ohio's Rayyan Buell and Pitt's Dayon Hayes are two of the standouts of the defensive front, while Michigan State's Ethan Boyd and Clemson's Zack Ownes are on the offensive line.\n\nLike the Miami football team, Colorado may not be done just yet either. If we've learned anything from Sanders in his short time in Boulder, it's that he's always got an eye on the portal.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

For Michigan State football and a few others, mercy has finally been given to them.\n\nThe college football transfer portal isn't always a give and take. Often, for a lot of teams, it's more take, depleting rosters not just of numbers but of overall team talent. Unfortunately, that's who we have to label the losers in this case, as they all can't be winners. The Spartans place at the top of that category, with three more notable teams right behind them.\n\nMichigan State Spartans\n\nThe transfer portal can be a fickle beast, as Michigan State football found out during the college football spring transfer portal window. The Spartans lost a whopping 22 players while only bringing in five. New head coach Jonathan Smith's arrival helped for a positive winter window where the team managed to retain 10 players who had initially entered the portal. However, their fortunes quickly changed once spring came.\n\nFour of those 10 players, including key starters on defense like Derrick Harmon and Simeon Barrow Jr., decided to re-enter the portal, joining other notable departures like safety Jaden Mangham and Bai Jobe. This left Michigan State football with significant gaps to fill, particularly on the defensive line where the spring portal had only slim pickings.\n\nDespite efforts to bolster their roster, such as adding highly touted 2024 prospect Andrew Dennis and beating out Alabama for cornerback transfer Ed Woods, Michigan State football still ends up as one of the biggest losers of the college football spring transfer portal.\n\nArizona State Sun Devils\n\nThe Arizona State football program is still in the early stages of building under Kenny Dillingham, who is entering his second year as the team's head coach. But if it already wasn't an uphill battle in Tempe, it just got even worse.\n\nThe Sun Devils football program faced some significant losses during the spring transfer portal that will likely not favor them as they prepare to enter the Big 12 in 2024. Some of the key losses were receiver Elijhah Badger, who led the team in receiving yards last season. Another was that of highly-touted 2023 quarterback Jaden Rashada, who was looking to be the potential starter in 2024. Finally, the loss of tight end Bryce Pierre was also a major hit to the offense.\n\nOn the defensive side, cornerback Ed Woods was a standout player for Arizona State football and one of the better cornerbacks in the Pac-12 last season. His departure leaves a significant gap in the secondary.\n\nLosing key players on both offense and defense, including arguably their best offensive and defensive players, along with a potential future star at quarterback, is a tough blow for Arizona State football. All in all, the Arizona State football team brings in just three new transfers to their 11 lost, making them losers during the spring cycle of the transfer portal.\n\nOregon State Beavers\n\nThe winter transfer window was brutal for Oregon State football, especially after losing coach Jonathan Smith to Michigan State, not to mention the complete demolition of the Pac-12 conference. It was no surprise then that they lost some of their most talented players, like quarterback DJ Uiagalelei. However, they were somehow able to manage holding on to their lead rusher in running back Damien Martinez.\n\nMartinez lasted only until the college football spring transfer portal opened before he entered his name. The former Beaver is now setting off for the sandy beaches of Miami, playing for the Hurricanes this fall.\n\nLooking at the state of the Oregon State football program now, Martinez's departure is not only a significant loss on the field but also one off of it. Oregon State football has no superstar-level talent, no proven head coach, and a shell of a conference home, with only Washington State by its side as remnants of the Pac-12.\n\nMartinez's move out from Corvallis wasn't the only one, however. Four-star transfer defensive lineman Sione Lolohea also will be moving to the ACC, going to Florida State. Including both cycles, the Beavers lost 25 players to their incoming 15. The 2024 version of Oregon State football is likely unable to resemble that of the last two years, which won a total combined 18 games.\n\nAlabama Crimson Tide\n\nThis one is probably going to come as a shock to most. Alabama football hasn't been the losers at much of anything for over two decades now. And really, they're not even that big of losers here. But losing 39 total players from both the winter and the spring windows that included multiple four and five star prospects, is set to make quite a makeover in Tuscaloosa.\n\nThe Crimson Tide have been living on the name of Nick Saban and the success he created with the program over two decades ago. It was not until Saban saw the writing on the wall where the ways of old recruiting weren't going to quite cut it any longer, leading to his retirement. The team is now in the hands of former Washington head coach Kalen DeBoer, who saw a mass exodus upon his arrival.\n\nDeBoer was left with a major disadvantage when he came to the Alabama football team. Not only did he have to follow in the footsteps of the greatest coach of all time but then he had to watch a plethora of his newfound players simply walk out the door because they had that luxury. Meanwhile, he could do nothing but wait until the spring window opened.\n\nIncluding some Washington players that chose to follow him, DeBoer has eight incoming transfers from both cycles. Some of those are former highly-ranked recruits, such as LT Overton and Domani Jackson. But make no mistake about it, this is all new to those in the Alabama football program. DeBoer has proven that he can make the portal work to his advantage like he did at Washington but Alabama and the SEC are a different animal. They're not so much losers like the others above here. They're just not overall winners of the college football spring transfer portal.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Although the transfer adds for programs all across the nation will continue, the bulk of the movement for this year is over.\n\nAnd with most of the top names off the board, the final tally produced a couple of clear winners in the spring portal movement.\n\nColorado and UCF made key pickups on both sides of the ball, while Oklahoma's additions in the trenches could pay huge dividends as it moves to the SEC in '24.\n\nTransfer Portal: Best Players Available | Players in Portal | Additions by Team\n\n6 Teams Winning College Football's Spring Transfer Portal Window\n\nAuburn\n\nMuch of the portal focus on Auburn this spring was whether or not coach Hugh Freeze would pursue a quarterback to push Payton Thorne this fall. The Tigers opted not to add a signal-caller but fortified two areas in need of help on the roster.\n\nAfter a year of uneven play and drops from the receivers, Auburn's pass catchers will look different in '24. Robert Lewis (Georgia State) was added in the first window, but Freeze sought more help this offseason, landing Penn State transfer Keandre Lambert-Smith (53 catches for 673 yards in '23). With Lambert-Smith in the fold to join freshman Cam Coleman and Lewis, the Tigers will have a much-improved receiving corps.\n\nAdding depth to the defensive line was clearly a focal point in the spring window. Three players on are on their way to the Plains, including Keyron Crawford from Arkansas State, Isaiah Raikes (USC), and Philip Blidi (Indiana).\n\nRelated: Post-Spring SEC Power Rankings for 2024\n\nColorado\n\nThe Buffaloes are once again undergoing another significant offseason makeover through the transfer portal. Losing cornerbacks Cormani McClain and Omarion Cooper and running back Dylan Edwards is significant, but the overall talent and depth appears to be in better shape going into the '24 season.\n\nCoach Deion Sanders has added nearly 40 transfers for this year and may not be finished adding this spring. But whether it was the first or spring window, there was a clear emphasis on improving both lines of scrimmage. As of early May, Colorado added nearly 20 transfers to restock the trenches, with the spring bringing Ethan Boyd (Michigan State), Zack Owens (Clemson), and Payton Kirkland (Texas) to the offensive side and Rayyan Buell (Ohio) and Dayon Hayes (Pitt) to the defensive side.\n\nAlthough the roster still needs work, the portal hauls (and closing well in the spring), should give the Buffaloes a chance to go bowling in '24.\n\nMiami\n\nGoing into the spring transfer window, coach Mario Cristobal's squad already had one of the ACC's top portal hauls after landing Washington State quarterback Cameron Ward and help for the team's defensive line (C.J. Clark from NC State, Marley Cook from Middle Tennessee, and Elijah Alston from Marshall).\n\nBut Cristobal and staff weren't done with that first haul, as the Hurricanes added several key pieces this spring. Running back Damien Martinez (Oregon State) is a missing piece in the backfield, and Houston transfer Sam Brown (62 catches for 815 yards in '23) adds to a receiving corps already featuring Xavier Restrepo and Jacolby George.\n\nAnd on defense, Miami added impact players at all three levels. Tackle Simeon Barrow (honorable mention All-Big Ten in '23 at Michigan State), linebacker Jaylin Alderman (Louisville), and cornerback Dyoni Hill (Marshall) solidify a defense that held teams to 22.8 points a game last year.\n\nRelated: College Football's Top 10 Wide Receivers for 2024\n\nOklahoma\n\nWith the Sooners on the move to the SEC in 2024 and holes to fill on both lines of scrimmage, solidifying the trenches has been a top priority all offseason for coach Brent Venables.\n\nAfter acquiring four offensive linemen in the first portal window, Oklahoma added more depth and talent by landing Branson Hickman in April. Hickman could be the best of the OL transfers landed by the Sooners this spring, especially since the Texas native has started 26 games at center for SMU over the last two years.\n\nFormer Arizona State and Louisville lineman Jermayne Lole was the first defensive portal addition this spring, but the bigger impact up front is likely to come from TCU standout Damonic Williams. The California native started all 15 games as a true freshman in '22 and followed up his solid debut with honorable mention All-Big 12 honors and five tackles for a loss last year.\n\nOregon\n\nCoach Dan Lanning's squad filled their needs in the first window, so the spring was all about adding more depth and talent to a roster capable of winning a conference title in its Big Ten debut.\n\nDefensive tackle Derrick Harmon was pursued by several power conference teams in need of help on the interior, but Lanning was able to close the deal in early May. Harmon graded out as a standout run stuffer (per PFF) and accumulated 3.5 tackles for a loss in 12 games with the Spartans last year.\n\nThe secondary has been a point of emphasis for Lanning all offseason, as the Ducks added four defensive backs in the first window. More help is on the way in the form of Alabama transfer Peyton Woodyard - the No. 115 player per the 247Sports Composite in the '24 class. Woodyard transferred after spending the spring in Tuscaloosa and is a valuable addition for the future.\n\nUCF\n\nThe Knights made a big splash in the first window by landing Arkansas transfer quarterback KJ Jefferson, who should be a perfect fit for coach Gus Malzahn's offense.\n\nBut Malzahn wasn't satisfied with just adding Jefferson and a handful of transfers in the first window, as UCF added contributors on both sides of the ball this spring. Receiver Jacoby Jones (Ohio) and running back Peny Boone (Louisville/Toledo) add to a group of playmakers that should be among the best in the Big 12. Also, Miami transfer Jacurri Brown solidifies the backup spot behind Jefferson.\n\nA struggling defense also got needed reinforcements. Sheldon Arnold II (East Tennessee State), Tre'Quon Fegans (USC), and Cedrick Hawkins (Ohio State) help a secondary that allowed 7.3 yards per pass attempt in the Big 12 last season. Also, Miami transfer Nyjalik Kelly adds a talented pass rusher to the front.\n\nSteven Lassan is the senior college football writer and editor for AthlonSports.com.

Players are finishing their semester classes, coaches are making calls to fill out their rosters, and spring recruiting is in full swing.\n\nSo now is a good time to take a deep dive into a large-scale topic, such as the impact of the winter/spring transfer portal windows on SEC programs.\n\nMore than 400 SEC players (404 to be exact) have entered the portal since December with 78 percent of those players finding new homes (so far). Nearly 250 additions (240 to be exact) will join an SEC program this season.\n\nThe league does not allow in-conference transfers during the spring window, and that likely has limited the amount of movement we could've seen this spring. But teams have made significant progress in building out their rosters.\n\nStacking as much talent and depth via the portal is critical due to the expectations of what SEC football will look like in a few months. According to BetMGM, there are 10 teams with over/under win totals of 7.5 (welcome, Oklahoma and Texas):\n\nWhat teams have been most active? What teams have been hit the hardest? What teams have taken a step forward from the pack? Those questions and more are answered in the 2024 SEC transfer portal census ... to date.\n\nThe total number of players entering and being brought in via the portal is substantial, but many times moves are tied to coaching movement. And there has been plenty in the SEC. The most notable change is Nick Saban's retirement and two other programs welcoming new coaches: Mississippi State (Jeff Lebby) is on its third coach in three years, and Texas A&M (Mike Elko) is replacing Jimbo Fisher, who had the highest buyout in college history.\n\nThere were 27 new coordinator hires, and the only programs that didn't hire at least one new coordinator were South Carolina and Tennessee.\n\nNote: Green signifies a change in that position\n\nSome of the notable hires include Bobby Petrino's return to Arkansas, a new offensive/defensive coordinator tandem at Auburn after just one season under Hugh Freeze, and Kentucky's Mark Stoops hiring an offensive coordinator for the fourth consecutive season: Bush Hamdan, who was the offensive coordinator for Boise State last season.\n\nAlso of note, there appears to be a collaborative spirit in the SEC as 10 teams feature at least one co-coordinator setup.\n\nNot surprisingly, teams with new coaches saw a significant amount of roster movement. Alabama led the SEC with 39 departures (scholarship and non-scholarship players), and Texas A&M was second with 31. Mississippi State had 25, which tied Oklahoma, Ole Miss and Vanderbilt for the third most.\n\nIt was a busy time for nearly every team: The average number of departures per roster is a staggering 25.2 players. Texas A&M had the most additions with 28, and Tennessee had the fewest departures with 15.\n\n(247Sports)\n\nTeams will continue to receive portal commitments. Every SEC program added at least one player who will help this fall and lost at least one player who made the staff wince. There are also many high-caliber non-portal returnees.\n\nBelow is a list of each team's top returning player, the best portal addition (overall and spring) and a painful portal departure:\n\nSpring addition: OL Kadyn Proctor (returned to Alabama from Iowa, No. 2 overall player in transfer portal, according to 247Sports)\n\nOverall addition: Dumas-Johnson (Georgia, 125 career tackles, 2022 Butkus Award finalist)\n\nOverall addition: DL Walter Nolan (Texas A&M, 37 tackles in 2023, No. 3 overall transfer portal prospect via 247Sports)\n\nReturnee: WR Luther Burden (86 receptions, 1,212 yards, 9 touchdowns in 2023, first-team All-SEC)\n\nSpring addition: WR Dalevon Campbell (Nevada, 31 receptions, 594 yards, two touchdowns in 2023, honorable mention All-Mountain West)\n\nDeparture: LB Grayson Howard\n\nReturnee: Edge James Pearce (13 tackles for loss, 8.5 sacks in 2023, first-team All-SEC selection)\n\nDuring the spring, the 16 SEC teams have combined for 32 transfer additions, and a few teams separated themselves.\n\nAlabama: The Crimson Tide had a few glaring needs: offensive line, kicker and defensive back. They've supplemented those needs with Proctor, the No. 1 offensive lineman in the portal; Graham Nicholson, the 2023 Lou Groza winner for nation's best kicker; Charlotte defensive back Kameron Howard; and Wake Forest defensive back DaShawn Jones, a two-year starter.\n\nAuburn: The Tigers added a few defensive players this spring to bolster the defensive front: Keyron Crawford (Arkansas State) and Isaiah Raikes (USC), but the biggest win was nabbing Lambert-Smith, one of the most sought-after players in the spring window.\n\nOklahoma: Brent Venables has a clear focus on upgrading the lines of scrimmage and did so with a few key additions: Branson Hickman, a three-year starting center from SMU; Jermayne Lole, a multiyear starting defensive linemen at Arizona State and Louisville; and Damonic Williams, an All-Big 12 defensive tackle from TCU.\n\nOle Miss: The Rebels were aggressive during the winter window, and that continued in the spring. The biggest need was running back where Lane Kiffin brought Henry Parrish back from Miami and added Croskey-Merritt, who was an All-Mountain West back in 2023.\n\nMissouri: The Tigers added a lot of talent in the winter window and a few interesting players thus far in the spring window. Bryant was an all-conference tackle at SMU last season and will be impactful, and Missouri picked up linebacker Jeremiah Beasley from Michigan: a four-star true freshman who transferred after going through spring practice.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kennington_smith_iii@theathletic.com", "name": "Kennington Smith

Graduated from Indiana and Nebraska-Omaha\n\nSpring football is well in the rearview mirror and so is the spring transfer window. While there is still time for spring portal entries to commit before the start of preseason camp, most big names have already announced their new destinations and fall rosters have been shaped.\n\nWhether it is established players seeking bigger opportunities or former prospects seeking fresh places, the portal continues to affect the landscape of college football in a major way. Quantifying the portal's impact on various programs can be difficult. Schools take different approaches to building their rosters, with some leaning more heavily on the portal than others, so portal rankings alone often don't tell the whole story.\n\nHere's a look at the 10 classes that made the biggest impact with spring transfers:\n\nMiami hasn't won a national title in over 20 years and its last 10-win season came in 2017. While recent on-field performance has fallen short of past success, coach Mario Cristobal is working the recruiting trail in an effort to change the on-field results. Miami signed a top-10 recruiting class for the 2024 cycle while also adding coveted transfer quarterback Cam Ward. Cristobal didn't rest during the spring transfer period, adding two offensive players ranked in the top 10 of ESPN's transfer player rankings.\n\nThe Hurricanes landed top transfer running back Damien Martinez after losing two of their top three leading rushers -- and over 1,110 yards of production -- from 2023. Martinez is an agile back with good power and speed. He was very productive at Oregon State and can reasonably be expected to carry the load in replacing the lost production. Martinez's presence in the backfield should only help Ward by giving the offense good balance. Miami also added a proven receiving target, Samuel Brown, from Houston. Brown caught 62 passes last year and is a tall target that can win 50-50 balls.\n\nThe Hurricanes did lose several defensive linemen to the portal but also signed the best defensive line class for the 2024 cycle. Still, there's no substitute for experience. So Miami returned to the portal to add defensive tackle Simeon Barrow Jr. from Michigan State on top of several prior transfers earlier in the process. Barrow is a consistent performer and, at the very least, boosts depth at this spot. Miami should be able to rotate fresh bodies and maintain a stout, aggressive defensive line -- a hallmark of its glory years.\n\n2. Colorado Buffaloes\n\nWe suggest using pencil, not pen, when covering all of Colorado's transfers. The Buffaloes are as active as any team in the country in the portal. While recent departures made headlines, they've also successfully brought in new faces to try and elevate the four-win program. Colorado prioritized revamping the offensive line. It had several options on campus this spring but continued to try and strengthen that unit. That includes landing Michigan State transfer Ethan Boyd, who was an active contributor in 2023. Colorado also added Payton Kirkland, a 2023 high three-star recruit who brings raw tools to still develop.\n\nThe Buffaloes added more talent to their defensive front as well. They landed a pair of top-40 transfers, Dayon Hayes (No. 3) from Pittsburgh and Rayyan Buell (No. 39) from Ohio. Hayes was one of the most notable pickups of the recent transfer window. He's an active, disruptive defense lineman and a needed plug-and-play addition.\n\nColorado lost its four top rushers from 2023. The loss of running back Dylan Edwards (to Kansas State) stings, but keep in mind only two Colorado backs even surpassed 300 yards in 2023. The Buffaloes added two of the top running backs available in Dallan Hayden and Rashad Amos. Hayden arrives from Ohio State where he flashed as a freshman (2022) and gives Colorado a quick, elusive runner. Amos is on his third school but is coming off a 1,000-yard season at Miami (Ohio) and complements Hayden as a bigger back who is more of a physical presence.\n\nColorado has made some strong upgrades, and it's likely not done. The question is whether it has brought in enough to strengthen its overall depth, but the additions so far are notable.\n\n3. UCF Knights\n\nThe Knights struggled in their first season in the Big 12, but they've remained active in recruiting and made some key additions during this spring period. Former ESPN 300 defensive lineman Nyjalik Kelly leads the group. He arrives via Miami where he had four sacks as a true freshman. While injuries hampered him last season, when healthy, he gives UCF an explosive defender. He could quickly help replace the production lost with Tre'mon Morris-Brash, who tallied over 20 tackles for loss and 8.5 sacks before moving on to the NFL. They also added Cedrick Hawkins Jr., who signed with Ohio State in 2023 but returns home to Florida with the physical tools and remaining eligibility to be a productive long-term fixture in their secondary.\n\nOffensively, the Knights got great production from RJ Harvey, who rushed for over 1,400 yards with 16 touchdowns, but have bolstered their depths with the addition of Peny Boone, who also rushed for 1,400 yards last season with Toledo. Boone is a bigger downhill runner and forms a nice one-two punch with Harvey. The Knights have one of the most talented running back pairings in the country.\n\n4. Oklahoma Sooners\n\nThe Sooners are arriving in the SEC with an upgraded defensive front. Landing five-star defensive tackle David Stone was huge considering he's a young player with impact potential. OU also added experience through the portal. TCU transfer Damonic Williams, the No. 4 prospect in the spring portal, was the most notable addition. The 320-pounder is a big body with good quickness and performed well for the Horned Frogs after arriving as a four-star recruit in the 2022 class. He's a strong candidate to seize a starting role. Louisville transfer Jermayne Lole can be a handful when he's healthy and clicking on all cylinders. Adding those three players helps Oklahoma offset the loss of several contributors.\n\nThe Sooners also added an experienced, sound interior offensive lineman in SMU transfer Branson Hickman. He has more than 30 career starts and it wouldn't be surprising to see him assume a starting role this fall.\n\n5. Alabama Crimson Tide\n\nThere's a popular expression that if you love something, set it free, and if it comes back it was meant to be. That applies to offensive tackle Kadyn Proctor. Alabama had to love the growth and improvement from the five-star freshman at left tackle last season and was likely heartbroken to see him decide to transfer home to Iowa after the season. Proctor is one of the most talented and promising young offensive linemen in the sport. But his homecoming was short-lived. Proctor returned to the portal and is poised to head back to Tuscaloosa, creating one of the big wins of this transfer period. He endured some growing pains in 2023, but Alabama can now field one of the most formidable guard-tackle pairs in the league as he lines up alongside NFL first-round prospect and fellow former five-star Tyler Booker.\n\nProctor is enough to get Alabama on this list, but the Tide also continued to address and rebuild the secondary with the addition of top-50 portal prospect Kameron Howard. A 2023 signee with Charlotte, he was a productive contributor in Year 1. He provides Alabama with a little bit of experience but, more importantly, a very good blend of speed and quickness. Time is on his side to keep developing within that unit. The transfer portal might be closed, but the Crimson Tide might not be done adding to their secondary which would further strengthen their success via this route.\n\n6. Auburn Tigers\n\nAuburn identified a key need at receiver this offseason and improved the group with several excellent 2024 signings, led by five-star recruit Cameron Coleman. The Tigers further addressed the group by landing Penn State transfer KeAndre Lambert-Smith, one of the top transfer receivers available. The 2020 ESPN 300 receiver never broke out as an explosive playmaker in Happy Valley but still brings that potential and has been productive, leading the Nittany Lions in receiving in 2023. The future undoubtedly lies with the dynamic incoming young receiver class, but Lambert-Smith provides high value as an experienced option who can immediately step in and elevate production while also helping groom the Tigers' new notable signees.\n\nHistory has proven teams need talented defensive fronts to compete in the SEC. Coach Hugh Freeze knows that. He used the portal to strengthen the trenches as well. Adding Indiana transfer Philip Blidi was a key addition. He's been productive throughout his career, first at Texas Tech and then with the Hoosiers, and will bolster a Tigers run defense that finished near the bottom of the conference last season.\n\n7. California Golden Bears\n\nCal improved throughout 2023 and finished strong by winning three of its last four games. Now, the Bears are working to strengthen their roster as they enter the ACC despite losing their fair share of talented players, including leading receiver Jeremiah Hunter to Washington. California made strides to replace him and potentially even upgrade its receiving corps.\n\nTight end Jack Endries returns, and he was a pleasant surprise coming off a strong redshirt freshman season. He'll pair with top-30 portal prospect Corey Dyches. Cal flipped the Maryland transfer from a brief commitment to Charlotte and added a target with a wide catch radius who hauled in nearly 90 passes over the past two seasons. Dyches and Endries form a nice tandem that can further open up the passing attack and help players like Ohio State wide receiver transfer Kyion Grayes. The 2022 ESPN 300 prospect made little impact with the Buckeyes but still brings ability and three seasons of eligibility to realize that potential. Cal also added several defensive prospects including two young talented secondary players in Ryan Yaites and Jasiah Wagoner, both four-star prospects in the 2023 class.\n\n8. Minnesota Golden Gophers\n\nDespite losing several of their own players, the Gophers landed multiple new additions, including a pair of top-50 portal prospects. Minnesota brought Jaxon Howard, the state's top prospect in the 2023 cycle, back home after a brief stint with LSU. His upside is the key here, but getting an in-state player who can develop into an explosive edge rusher is a big win, even if it comes with slightly delayed gratification. Howard's impact at first might be minimal, but he has the tools to become a key defender and a strong contributor at some point in 2024.\n\nWide receiver Tyler Williams was also a top 2023 prospect. His initial college production with Georgia was limited, but he arrives in Minnesota with time on his side and a wealth of ability. The 6-foot-3, 205-pound receiver blends size and speed, hitting 21 mph during game play in high school, to create big play potential. Howard and Williams won't be the most immediately impactful of the Golden Gophers' recent additions, but landing two young players with immense physical skill is big for P.J. Fleck and his program as they compete in the increasingly competitive Big Ten.\n\n9. Oregon Ducks\n\nThe Ducks are establishing themselves as a title contender in 2024 and beyond with their recruiting and portal acumen. While their additions this period have been minimal, it all adds to a strong recruiting class and several notable transfer additions from the winter period, including quarterback Dillon Gabriel. Freshman Peyton Woodyard returns west to join the Ducks after a short-lived tenure with Alabama. The St. John Bosco (Bellflower, California) product was a leader by example according to his high school coaches and is a physical, instinctive safety. He's more of an addition for the future.\n\nDefensive lineman Derrick Harmon will more immediately bolster the Ducks' 2024 playoff hopes. The 6-foot-5, 320-pound Michigan State transfer is a big presence at a premium position in the portal and is coming off his most productive season. He's a tough defender against the run and already has experience in the Big Ten.\n\n10. Washington Huskies\n\nThe Huskies might be coming off an appearance in the national title game, but it is a new era with a new conference in the Big Ten and a new coach in Jedd Fisch. Despite their success last season, this roster has undergone quite a bit of change. Fisch, who did a nice job rebuilding Arizona, is staying active in the portal to avoid a major dip for the Huskies in 2024. They made key additions during the last transfer window with players like receiver Jeremiah Hunter (Cal) and freshman QB Demond Williams Jr. (Arizona). During this spring period they have remained very active adding more offensive talent, including receiver Kevin Green Jr. and running back Jordan Washington. A four-star prospect in the 2022 class, Green played for Fisch at Arizona and comes with three years of eligibility remaining, and Washington was an ESPN 300 prospect in the 2024 cycle who initially committed to Arizona. He is a runner with big play ability as he possesses home run speed with a 10.24 100m in track. He's not only a dangerous runner but can also be utilized as a receiver out of the backfield with over 70 receptions in prep career.\n\nWashington also used this period to improve offensive line depth in Enokk Vimahi (Ohio State) and Logan Sagapolu (Miami). Neither have been consistent starters, but they bring experience to the unit. The Huskies also added to their defense with edge defender Jayden Wayne. A Washington native who signed with Miami out of IMG in the 2023 class, he possesses a lengthy frame with fluid movement skills and still brings a high ceiling for development.", "source": {"uri":

When the game ended, the worst time of the year began for college football fans: the dreaded offseason. Nearly eight months without college football. It feels like it just started, but we have somehow already made it to May. The weather is getting warmer, and we are getting closer to football season. Spring football just concluded for UCLA football, and Bruins fans can't wait for the 2024 season to roll around.\n\nSpring football is one of the best times of the college football offseason as a sense of hope comes to every fan base around the country. It's exciting to see your team in action in the first time, even though it's just a scrimmage. You started to see the roster taking shape and projected depth charts start trickling out. Spring football is the first sign of the season, and now that it's over, college football fans are really in the home stretch. The cold winter months are tough to survive without football, but the excitement that comes with spring football makes everything easier. There is still a ways to go before the new season, but it is coming.\n\nThis next season of college football is going to be an exciting one, and there are a ton of reasons to be looking forward to it. There are a lot of changes coming to the game like rule changes, coaching changes, conference changes and playoff changes. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the new season will be the new conferences. The Pac-12 is gone, and the Big Ten and SEC are going to be loaded. They both seem to be on the verge of forming super conferences.\n\nThe SEC will be welcoming Texas and Oklahoma to the conference next year, and the Big Ten is getting a good crop of Pac-12 teams as USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington are all joining the conference. Both the Big Ten and the SEC are going to be absolutely loaded next year, and it seems like more schools will potentially join the conferences in the future.\n\nNext season, the College Football Playoff will look different as well as it is expanding to 12 teams. There will also be first round games on college campuses. More teams will have a chance to make the CFP, and there will be more games. It's going to be fun.\n\nUCLA football has a new head coach for 2024\n\nOne team that has a big offseason ahead them is UCLA football. The Bruins lost head coach Chip Kelly in the offseason as he left to be the new offensive coordinator at Ohio State. UCLA now has DeShaun Foster, and he certainly has his work cut out for him.\n\nUCLA football struggled last season, and things will likely be a lot more difficult for them this upcoming season in the Big Ten with a new head coach. The new Big Ten is going to be loaded, and the schedule is not easy for the Bruins. They have a lot of work to do to get ready for the 2024 season if they want to be able to compete in this talented conference.\n\nThe good news for Foster is that he done some work in the transfer portal and he does also have some starters from last year coming back in key positions. His situation isn't great, but it could be worse. This UCLA team has brought in some talent from the transfer portal, but they have also lost some. The Bruins split is dead even currently as they have lost 17 players to the portal and they have also gained 17. They didn't lose much in terms of significant production from last season in the spring transfer portal window, but here is the departure that hurts the most.\n\nKyle Ford, WR\n\nKyle Ford has had an interesting college football career so far as he spent the first three seasons of it with the USC football team. Ford transferred over to UCLA football for the 2023 season, but he decided to enter the transfer portal again this offseason. Where is he headed? Back to USC.\n\nThis isn't that bad of a loss for UCLA, but it still does hurt and Kyle Ford was a solid contributor on offense last season. He finished the year with 22 receptions for 236 yards and one touchdown. His previous two seasons with the Trojans were a little bit better, and after head coach Chip Kelly left, it's not that surprising to see Ford make the move back to USC.\n\nUSC will also likely have the more explosive offense between the two schools next season, so Kyle Ford likely has a better chance of excelling with the Trojans. It will be interesting to see what kind of season he has as it will be his fifth year of college football.\n\nAt the end of the day, DeShaun Foster did a pretty good job of keeping his roster intact. Usually when a head coach leaves, there are more transfer portal departures than additions, but not for the Bruins this offseason. That's a good start to the offseason for Foster.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_Bruins_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UCLA Bruins football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeShaun_Foster", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DeShaun Foster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chip Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_State_Buckeyes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio State Buckeyes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Football", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/UCLA-footballs-biggest-loss-in-2024-Spring-transfer-portal-window.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554075", "eventUri": "eng-9554075", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It feels like it just started, but we have somehow already made it to May. The weather is getting warmer, and we are getting closer to football season. Spring football just concluded for Georgia football, and Bulldogs fans can't wait for the 2024 season to roll around.\n\nSpring football is one of the best times of the college football offseason as a sense of hope comes to every fan base around the country. It's exciting to see your team in action in the first time, even though it's just a scrimmage. You started to see the roster taking shape and projected depth charts start trickling out.

There will also be first round games on college campuses. More teams will have a chance to make the CFP, and there will be more games. It's going to be fun.\n\nGeorgia football wants to return to the top this season\n\nThe Georgia football team looked unstoppable for a couple years there when they won back-to-back national titles. The Bulldogs had been close leading up to that 2021 season, and then they finally broke through. The 2022 season was a different type of dominant, however. Georgia finished the season 15-0 and their win over TCU in the national title game was one of the most lopsided national title games ever.\n\nGeorgia football came into the 2023 season looking to win a third straight national title, but Alabama had different plans. The Bulldogs had everything go to plan in the regular season as they took care of business each week. It wasn't super flashy or loud, but the Bulldogs just kept winning and held a top ranking in college football. Then, Georgia lost against Alabama in the SEC title game, and they dropped all the way out of the top-four rankings after going into the game ranked #1. Just like that, one little slip up cost the Bulldogs their season.\n\nIn bowl season, Georgia football went to the Orange Bowl to take on Florida State. Both teams felt like they should've made the College Football Playoff, and the Bulldogs really wanted to prove that. They dominated the Seminoles and ended up winning 63-3.\n\nNow, Georgia is getting ready for the next season, and they want to return to the mountaintop of college football. The Bulldogs have a lot of talent on their team and they are expected to be one of the best teams in college football yet again. Georgia returned a good amount of production from last year's team, but they also have lost a good amount of players to the transfer portal. The Bulldogs are bringing in nine transfers, and they have lost 24. Most of those players left before the spring window, and that is where they lost their biggest player makers. Here is the portal departure that hurts the most from the spring window.\n\nAndrew Paul, RB\n\nAndrew Paul was a true freshman last season and he had a solid year for it being his first experience playing college football. Paul finished the year with 29 carries for 129 yards and one touchdown. He averaged over 4.4 yards per carry. Paul was obviously in a backup role last year, but that is to be expected for a true freshman. He played well when he came into the game, and it looks like he has a bright future ahead. That future is not with Georgia football, however.\n\nIt's unclear where Andrew Paul is headed, but he did take a visit to Michigan State recently. The Spartans are breaking in a new head coach and they are coming off of a dreadful season. There will certainly be a lot of starting jobs up for grabs in East Lansing.\n\nMichigan State is also still an attractive option for RB transfers after we saw what happened with Kenneth Walker III a few years ago. He came to the Spartans from Wake Forest and ended up being one of the best RBs in college football. He is now in the NFL with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nAndrew Paul should be able to put up a solid season next year wherever he ends up after getting another offseason under his belt. He showed a lot of promise during that freshman season, now he needs to build on it.\n\nAt the end of the day, Georgia football didn't lose anyone in the spring window that was going to be a starter during the 2024 season. The Bulldogs kept things intact for the most part, and they should be very good yet again next season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

The spring window did not offer the most talent but it was filled with depth players. Defensive tackles were at a premium.\n\nOn3 is taking a closer look at six teams who won the spring transfer portal:\n\nTransfer Commits: WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith (Penn State), OL Ronan Chambers (Akron), DL Philip Blidi (Indiana), DL Isaiah Raikes (USC), EDGE Keyron Crawford (Arkansas State)\n\nHugh Freeze did not target a quarterback this spring, however, the Auburn coach picked up a handful of impact players. The Tigers add Lambert-Smith, who led Penn State with 53 catches for 673 yards and four touchdowns in 2023. The addition gives Auburn an experienced receiver to pair with a young and talented receiver room, headlined by Cam Coleman. But more than that, Freeze beat out Texas A&M for Lambert-Smith.\n\nAuburn also addressed the defensive line. Blidi posted 11 hurries in 2023 at Indiana. The 6-foot-3, 295-pound defensive lineman posted four tackles for loss, too. Raikes has SEC experience from his time at Texas A&M. In the last two seasons, he's recorded 34 tackles, 4.5 tackles for loss and a forced fumble. As a sophomore last season, Crawford ranked fourth in the Sun Belt, 19th among the Group of Five and 52nd nationally with 25 hurries. His 37 total quarterback pressures also ranked 55th nationally.\n\nTransfer Commits: RB Dallan Hayden (Ohio State), RB Rashad Amos (Miami OH), TE Charlie Williams (UNLV), OL Ethan Boyd (Michigan State), OL Payton Kirkland (Texas), OL Zechariah Owens (Clemson), OL Wyatt Hummel (Villanova) DL Tawfiq Thomas (Louisville), DL Rayyan Buell (Ohio) EDGE Dayon Hayes (Pitt), LB Nikhai Hill-Green (Charlotte), LB Johnny Chaney (Florida A&M), CB Ivan Yates (Furman), CB Colton Hood (Auburn)\n\nThe Buffaloes continued to address the need on the offensive line this spring. Colorado picked up four linemen in Boyd, Hummel, Kirkland and Owens. Boyd and Hummel are the most proven of the bunch. A 6-foot-7, 325-pound tackle with two seasons of eligibility remaining, Boyd played in 12 games in 2023 with 313 snaps, allowing two sacks, nine hurries and 13 quarterback pressures. Hummel is a grad transfer who played 402 Snaps for Villanova in 2023 and allowed just three total pressures.\n\nArguably the biggest loss of the spring portal for Colorado was the departure of Dylan Edwards, who was used at both running back and in the passing game. Deion Sanders answered that by adding Amos and Hayden. The Buffs actually flipped Amos from Mississippi State. The former South Carolina transfer rushed for 1,075 yards and 13 touchdowns this past season at Miami (OH). Hayden flashed at moments with Ohio State, most notably in 2022 as a true freshman when he rushed for 553 yards and five touchdowns on 111 carries. He played in just three games in 2023.\n\nColorado also addressed the defensive side of the ball. With new defensive coordinator Robert Livingston, who spent 12 years with the Cincinnati Bengals, the Buffaloes picked up two linebackers who should all be able to contribute immediately. Hill-Green started his career at Michigan and tallied 73 tackles as a team captain at Charlotte in 2023. Chaney was an All-SWAC second-team selection after posting 73 tackles, 7.5 tackles for loss and three sacks.\n\nTransfer Commits: RB Damien Martinez (Oregon State), WR Sam Brown (Houston), DL Simeon Barrow (Michigan State), LB Jaylin Alderman (Louisville), CB D'yoni Hill (Marshall)\n\nMiami's transfer portal plans were somewhat on pause this winter as the Hurricanes went all-in on Washington State transfer quarterback Cam Ward. They finally won out after Ward announced for the NFL Draft before deciding to return to college and play at Miami. Mario Cristobal's staff has pieced together one of the best spring portal classes.\n\nMartinez was one of the top impact players to enter the portal in April. An All-Pac-12 First Team selection in 2023 as a sophomore, he rushed for 1,185 yards on 194 carries with a 6.1-yard average. Brown has previous experience with offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson. The wideout has 1,394 career receiving yards on 113 catches and seven touchdowns.\n\nNext to Martinez, landing a commitment from Barrow was a major win for the Hurricanes. The defensive tackle has 34 career appearances with 30 starts. He's posted 110 career tackles, 18.5 tackles for loss and 10.5 sacks. Miami might not be done, either. The Hurricanes are still in the mix to land former Tennessee and Louisville EDGE Tyler Baron.\n\nTransfer Commits: OL Branson Hickman (SMU), DL Damonic Williams (TCU), DL Jermayne Lole (Louisville)\n\nOklahoma knew it needed to add proven talent in the trenches this spring before officially making the move to the SEC. The Sooners delivered. Hickman can be immediately slated into the starting mix on the offensive line, specifically at center. A three-year starter at SMU, he made 33 career starts for the Mustangs and played 2,436 snaps.\n\nThe biggest win of the spring for OU was landing Williams. A true freshman All-American in 2022, the Sooners beat out LSU, Missouri and Texas for the 6-foot-2, 320-pound defensive tackle. As impactful as Williams can be for Oklahoma's defensive line, the transfer win signified the Sooners can compete in NIL and are ready for the SEC. The TCU transfer was the top available defensive lineman this spring. He totaled 60 tackles, 9.5 tackles for loss and 4.5 sacks in two seasons with the Horned Frogs. Williams leaves Fort Worth with 26 career pressures and 20 hurries.\n\nLole flew under the radar with Oklahoma going all-in to land Williams, however, the Oklahoma transfer should make an immediate impact. The former Arizona State and Oklahoma transfer has played 1,633 snaps and has 141 career tackles, 25 tackles for loss and 12.5 sacks.\n\nTransfer Commits: DL Derrick Harmon (Michigan State), S Peyton Woodyard (Alabama)\n\nOregon did not have many needs in the spring portal window, but the Ducks landed exactly who they were looking for. Harmon picked Oregon over Colorado, Ohio State and USC. Sources told On3 that the opportunity to be developed and play on the national stage made a difference for the defensive lineman. The two-time All-Big Ten honorable mention finished the 2023 season with 20 pressures and 18 hurries.\n\nPicking up Woodyard was another key win for the Ducks. A four-star recruit in the 2024 class was at Alabama for just a few months before heading back to the West Coast. The 6-foot-2, 188-pound freshman spent the spring working with Alabama's second-team defense and was one of 12 players to receive the Ozzie Newsome Most Improved Freshman Award.\n\nTransfer Commits: QB Jacurri Brown (Miami), RB Peny Boone (Louisville), WR Jacoby Jones (Ohio), OL Keegan Smith (Central Michigan), EDGE Nyjalik Kelly (Miami), CB Tre'quon Fegans (USC), S Sheldon Arnold II (East Tennessee State University), S Cedrick Hawkins (Ohio State)\n\nAs much as the transfer portal is about adding talent that can make an immediate difference on the field, UCF picked up a few pieces for the future, too. In Year 2 in the Big 12, the Knights want to take a step forward and compete for a conference title. Boone was the 2023 Mid-American Conference Player of the Year and rushed for 1,400 yards and 15 touchdowns. His addition will give UCF another tailback in the arsenal to pair with RJ Harvey and Johnny Richardson.\n\nBrown provides a talented backup to KJ Jefferson, who transferred from Arkansas for his final year of eligibility. The Miami transfer quarterback will also have a clear shot at the starting job for the 2025 season and fits head coach Gus Malzahn's offense.\n\nAnother major pickup from the Hurricanes, Kelly picked UCF. The former top-100 recruit tallied 19 tackles, four sacks and a pass deflection in two years at Miami. The Knights also added former top recruits Hawkins and Fegans.\n\nJones missed most of the 2023 season at Ohio with injury, but he had 45 catches for 777 yards and six touchdowns in 2022. He averaged 17.3 yards per catch that season.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pete_nakos@on3.com", "name": "Pete Nakos", "type": "author",

When the game ended, the worst time of the year began for college football fans: the dreaded offseason. Nearly eight months without college football. It feels like it just started, but we have somehow already made it to May. The weather is getting warmer, and we are getting closer to football season. Spring football just concluded for Washington, and Huskies fans can't wait for the 2024 season to roll around.\n\nSpring football is one of the best times of the college football offseason as a sense of hope comes to every fan base around the country. It's exciting to see your team in action in the first time, even though it's just a scrimmage. You started to see the roster taking shape and projected depth charts start trickling out. Spring football is the first sign of the season, and now that it's over, college football fans are really in the home stretch. The cold winter months are tough to survive without football, but the excitement that comes with spring football makes everything easier. There is still a ways to go before the new season, but it is coming.\n\nThis next season of college football is going to be an exciting one, and there are a ton of reasons to be looking forward to it. There are a lot of changes coming to the game like rule changes, coaching changes, conference changes and playoff changes. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the new season will be the new conferences. The Pac-12 is gone, and the Big Ten and SEC are going to be loaded. They both seem to be on the verge of forming super conferences.\n\nThe SEC will be welcoming Texas and Oklahoma to the conference next year, and the Big Ten is getting a good crop of Pac-12 teams as USC, UCLA, Oregon and Washington are all joining the conference. Both the Big Ten and the SEC are going to be absolutely loaded next year, and it seems like more schools will potentially join the conferences in the future.\n\nNext season, the College Football Playoff will look different as well as it is expanding to 12 teams. There will also be first round games on college campuses. More teams will have a chance to make the CFP, and there will be more games. It's going to be fun.\n\nWashington football is breaking in a new head coach after making it to the national championship\n\nThe Washington football team is coming off of one of the best seasons that they have ever had. This was the last season that the Huskies, and nine other schools, were part of the Pac-12 conference, and the final football season with all of the teams together did not disappoint. Washington and Oregon highlighted the talented conference, and the two teams played in two great games during the season. The Huskies ended up getting the better of the Ducks in both of those matchups, and that helped them get all the way to the national title game.\n\nIt was a great season for the Huskies, but Michigan was just too much for the Huskies to handle in the national title game. The Wolverines got out to a big lead early, and while Washington started to play much better on defense, their offense was never able to get anything going against Michigan's top defense. The Wolverines scored 14 points in the first quarter, and the Huskies scored just 13 points in the entire game. Michigan went on to win 34-13.\n\nWashington had a great season, but their offseason has not gone so well. The Huskies are losing most of their production from this season, and they also lost their head coach. Nick Saban decided to retire after this season, and Kalen DeBoer is now the head coach of the Alabama football team. The Huskies made a ton of progress to get near the top of the college football world, and it seems like a lot of that progress is now lost.\n\nThe good news for Washington football is that they made a great hire to replace Kalen DeBoer. Jedd Fisch is the new head coach of the Huskies, and he did a tremendous job of turning around Arizona quickly. He has had a good offseason bringing people over to Washington in the transfer portal, and a lot of his Wildcats have joined the team. He has also lost some players to the portal but that is expected after a head coach leaves. There wasn't a lot of damage in the spring window, but here is the departure that stings the most.\n\nDermaricus Davis, Quarterback\n\nQB Dermaricus Davis left Washington football via the transfer portal and he is going to play for UCLA next season. This isn't a big blow for the Huskies are Will Rogers transferred in (and out and back in again) this offseason, and he will more than likely be the starting QB next season. Still, Davis is an intriguing player with a lot of talent, and he would've been big for depth in the QB room. He also is a true freshman and could've earned the starting job down the road.\n\nDermaricus Davis has had an interesting college football career already and it hasn't been going on for a very long time. Davis is a true freshman from the 2024 recruiting class and he enrolled early. Things apparently didn't work out for him at Washington, and he wants to test the waters at UCLA. He did go to high school in California, so he will be closer to home.\n\nThis isn't a big hurt for this upcoming season, but Davis looked like the future for the Huskies at the QB position. He was a four-star recruit out of high school and he should go on to have a promising college career.\n\nIt's going to be interesting to watch this Washington football team next season. They might take a step back next year, but Jedd Fisch should be able to find success with the Huskies.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scotty_white@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Scotty White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pac-12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalen_DeBoer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalen DeBoer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Wolverines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Wolverines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Wildcats", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Wildcats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedd_Fisch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jedd Fisch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Saban", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Saban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshirt_(college_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redshirt (college sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Gaelic/Football", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/7354416591.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554075", "eventUri": "eng-9554075", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

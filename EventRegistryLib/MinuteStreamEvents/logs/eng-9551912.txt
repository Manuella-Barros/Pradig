While the report says there's \"no reason to assume that a change at the helm is imminent,\" there are multiple possibilities as to who code eventually take over.\n\nThe report, which is based on conversations with \"several people familiar with Apple's inner workings,\" says that if a change was made soon, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams would almost certainly take the reins as CEO:\n\nIf Cook were to step down soon, these people say, he would almost assuredly be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who emerged as the top candidate to be Cook's successor a few years ago.\n\nBut Williams, who's 61 this year, is only two years Cook's junior, and company insiders say they think it's now unlikely he'll be the new long-term chief. Apple's board would probably want an executive who, like Cook and Jobs, would stick around for at least a decade. \"If you asked me five years ago, it was very clear Jeff was leading the pack to become CEO,\" says one longtime Apple executive. \"But the slowness to refresh the C-suite leaves a problem with who you can bring on board.\"\n\nBut the report says that \"people close to him\" believe that Cook will be Apple's CEO for \"at least another three years.\" If that pans out, John Ternus is the \"most likely successor\" to Tim Cook for Apple CEO.\n\nTernus is currently Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, and has taken an increasingly visible role at Apple over the last several years.\n\nThe report describes Ternus as \"well-liked inside Apple,\" with praise from Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, and many others. One key factor, too, is that Ternus is 49 years old. This makes him \"more likely than other members of the executive team to stick around for a long time.\"\n\nTernus is well-liked inside Apple, and he's earned the respect of Cook, Williams and other leaders. \"Tim likes him a lot, because he can give a good presentation, he's very mild-mannered, never puts anything into an email that is controversial and is a very reticent decision-maker,\" says one person close to Apple's executive team. \"He has a lot of managerial characteristics like Tim.\"\n\nChristopher Stringer, a former top Apple hardware designer, called Ternus a \"trustworthy hand\" who's \"never failed with any role he's been elevated to.\" Eddy Cue, the Apple executive known as Cook's closest confidant, has privately told colleagues that Ternus should be the next CEO, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nWhat about other Apple executives? Bloomberg says that people such as Craig Federighi and Deirdre O'Brien are \"unlikely successors\" to Cook, despite being well-liked.

Since then Apple has seen unprecedented success including huge iPhone sales, the entry into new markets like the Apple Watch and now Apple Vision Pro, and more. But it's a fact that Tim Cook won't be able to stick around forever and Apple is likely already starting to look at who could be a likely replacement. According to one report, there's one man in particular that seems most likely to take over.\n\nWriting for Bloomberg, Mark Gurman suggests that while any imminent change could see the arrival of Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams in the top job, Apple is making plans beyond then - and it doesn't expect that Cook is going away any time soon.\n\nGurman says that Apple does have Jeff Williams in line should Cook step aside sooner rather than later, citing people familiar with Apple's inner workings. However, Williams is 61 this year which means that he isn't all that much younger than Cook who turns 64 later in 2024. That means that Williams is unlikely to be a long-term replacement for Cook, which means that Apple will have plans for a more permanent solution.\n\nThat solution, it seems, is Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering and a key figure during this week's iPad event, John Ternus. The profile of Ternus has continued to be raised in recent years and Apple has used him more liberally when announcing new products. He's also been put in front of various members of the press more often than was previously the case, too.\n\nGurman says that Tim is a fan of Cook, citing one person close to Apple's executive team.

The source suggested that Ternus has a lot of the same characteristics as Cook, adding that he isn't one for making controversial statements.\n\nChristopher Stringer, a former top Apple hardware designer, reportedly called Ternus a trustworthy hand that Apple may turn to, saying that he's never failed at a new role when he has been asked to fulfill one.\n\nNotably, it's been suggested that popular figures like Craig Federighi and Deidre O'Brien are unlikely to be involved in any reshuffle, while Phil Schiller and hardware head Dan Riccio are thought to be coming to the end of their time at Apple rather than looking to take over the company.", "source": {"uri": "tweaktown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TweakTown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_haslam@tweaktown.com", "name": "Oliver Haslam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Williams (Apple)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ternus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Ternus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Riccio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Riccio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Federighi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food_and_Drink", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food and Drink", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static.tweaktown.com/news/9/8/98176_01_is-this-the-next-apple-ceo-when-tim-cook-finally-steps-aside_full.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551912", "eventUri": "eng-9551912", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

He's served for far longer than the average Fortune 500 CEO, and, at 63, is older than many of his peers. But if it seems like a logical time for Cook to start planning for someone else to shape Apple's next chapter, the situation is complicated by the lack of someone who's both ready immediately and likely to be a long-term successor.\n\nLate yesterday Bloomberg's Mark Gurman weighed in on the matter by stating that he had spoken with several people familiar with Apple's inner workings, who said that if Cook steps down soon, COO (Chief Operating Officer) Jeff Williams will almost certainly Williams will succeed him as CEO, who was a favorite to succeed Cook a few years ago.\n\nBut the 61-year-old Williams is only two years younger than Cook, and Apple's board of directors hopes to have a CEO who can work at Apple for at least ten years like Cook and Jobs .\n\nInsiders close to Cook believe that Cook will continue to serve as Apple CEO for at least three years . If this is true, John Ternus will be the most likely successor to Apple CEO after Cook.\n\nTernus joined Apple in 2001 and holds a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. In January 2021 Apple promoted Ternus to VP of Hardware Engineering replacing Dan Riccio.\n\nGurman said Ternus was popular within Apple and that Cook had nothing but praise for him. Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, has privately told colleagues that Ternus should be the next CEO. There's also a key factor: Ternus is 49 years old , making him more likely to stay around long-term than other members of the executive team.

Everything you need to know about John Ternus", "body": "A new report suggests that John Ternus, Senior Vice President of Engineering at Apple, is likely to take over from CEO Tim Cook when the time comes.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, whose report is based on \"several people familiar with Apple's inner workings\" -- Jeff Williams, Apple's Chief Operating Officer, was tipped to be Cook's successor over the past few years. Although he could take over now if Cook decided to retire as soon as tomorrow, things seem to have changed regarding Apple's long-term succession plans.\n\n\"If you asked me five years ago, it was very clear Jeff was leading the pack to become CEO,\" one longtime Apple executive said, according to the report. \"But the slowness to refresh the C-suite leaves a problem with who you can bring on board.\"\n\nThere's a lot of positivity towards Ternus in the Bloomberg report, with one unnamed executive describing Cook's opinion of him. \"Tim likes him a lot because he can give a good presentation, he's very mild-mannered, never puts anything into an email that is controversial, and is a very reticent decision-maker.\"\n\nThe report also states that Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of Internet Software and Services, has privately told colleagues that Ternus should be the next CEO.\n\nTim Cook has been Apple's CEO since 2011 when Steve Jobs decided to step down due to poor health. Cook has since transformed the company into one that provides products and services for health, streaming content, and more. Even though he reportedly has no plans to retire for at least three years, it would be foolish for a company like Apple to not think about who the next logical choice could be as CEO.\n\nTernus was last seen at Apple's 'Let Loose' event on May 7, announcing the new M4 iPad Pro tablets. But just who is John Ternus?\n\nBefore working at Apple, John Ternus was an engineer at a company called Virtual Research Inc for several years from 1997, until he joined Apple in 2001 as part of its product design team.\n\nHe worked his way up the ladder until he was made Vice President of Hardware Engineering in 2013. In this role, which he still occupies, Ternus directly reports to Tim Cook and oversees the teams behind the iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and more.\n\nIn 2021 he was promoted again, becoming Senior Vice President of Engineering an earning a coveted spot on Apple's Leadership page.\n\nTernus has appeared in several Apple keynotes over the years. He showcased several software announcements at WWDC 2017, the M3 MacBook Pro at Apple's 'Screaming Fast' event, and the M4 iPad Pro at 'Let Loose'.\n\nAgain, we're likely years away from seeing Ternus take over from Cook, but his credentials at Apple do put him in good stead to be CEO someday. Rest assured though, whether the next CEO is Ternus or someone else -- expect to see plenty of new iPhones, iPads, and more showcased at future Apple events.

He's been serving as the Apple CEO for over two decades and will probably have to leave his post sooner or later as he turns 64 this year. A new report from Bloomberg, while noting that there is no reason to assume an imminent change at the helm, ponders on the idea of a successor and who could replace Cook for the top job at one of the most prominent tech companies in the world. Let's take a detailed look.\n\nBased on conversations with several people familiar with Apple's inner workings, the report mentions the possibility of Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams being promoted as the next CEO. As per the report, Williams emerged as the top candidate to be Cook's successor a few years ago and will probably replace the current CEO for the top job, if a change were to be made soon.\n\nAs per the report, Apple's board likely desires an executive who, similar to Cook and Jobs, would commit to the company for an extended period, ideally a decade or more. However, since Williams (61) is only two years younger than Cook, it is unlikely that he will be in it for the long haul.\n\nA longtime Apple executive told the publication that there was a strong belief five years ago that Jeff was the frontrunner for the CEO position. However, the delayed refresh creates challenges in identifying suitable candidates for the leadership role. People close to Cook anticipate him remaining as Apple's CEO for at least another three years, the report said.\n\nTalking about other potential candidates for the CEO role at Apple, the report highlights Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering- John Ternus. He is reportedly regarded highly within the company and praised by Tim Cook, Eddy Cue, and others. Known for his managerial qualities resembling those of Tim Cook, Ternus at 49 years old, is seen as more likely to remain with Apple long-term compared to other executives.\n\nThe report mentions Ternus earning endorsement privately from key figures within Apple, including Christopher Stringer and Eddy Cue, as the next CEO. Finally, the report mentions that while other executives like Craig Federighi and Deirdre O'Brien are liked but deemed unlikely to succeed Cook, those like Phil Schiller and Dan Riccio are seen as nearing the end of their tenures.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mohammad_faisal@news9live.com", "name": "Mohammad Faisal", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Williams (Apple)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ternus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Ternus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deirdre O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Riccio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Riccio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Federighi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Confectionery", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Confectionery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Apple-CEO-Tim-Cook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551912", "eventUri": "eng-9551912", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

And when the mercurial Apple cofounder died in 2011, many feared that Apple would too.\n\nHowever, Tim Cook, Jobs's right hand man, found a way to expand Apple's success by pushing incremental improvements in products while ramping up revenue from services like iCloud and Apple Music. His tenure has brought a 1200% increase in Apple's value.\n\nCook has less success on the world-changing new device front, however. Apple Watch is a hit, and AirPods in all their forms made wireless earbuds a hot commodity. But the Apple Vision Pro headset seems like an uncertain bet on the future of computing, and the \"secret\" Apple car project is officially dead.\n\nLove him or hate him, Tim Cook surely won't be Apple CEO for another decade. He's is 63 years old, and while Cook is not expected to step down soon, that day is coming.\n\nWho will succeed Tim Cook to become Apple's next CEO? Apple reportedly has a plan... two of them, actually. Plan A kicks in if Cook steps off the wrong curb (his words not mine) in the near future. Plan B goes into effect if Cook hangs around for a few more years, enabling a well-managed handoff to his successor.\n\nApple operations chief Jeff Williams is Plan A. He seems to be the logical choice to be the next CEO except that he's 61 years old. That's means he would be unlikely to take the top spot for more than a few years. But he could take over as CEO if Apple needed one tomorrow.\n\nThat makes John Ternus Plan B. He's the one most likely to take over for Cook for the long haul, according to Bloomberg. For one thing, he's over a decade younger than the current chief executive and Williams.\n\nPlus, Ternus has the support of the current head honcho.\n\n\"Tim likes him a lot, because he can give a good presentation, he's very mild-mannered, never puts anything into an email that is controversial and is a very reticent decision-maker,\" a source inside Apple told Bloomberg.\n\nThankfully, Ternus has more going for him than good deportment. He's already in change of a significant percentage of Apple products. His official company bio says:\n\n\"John joined Apple's Product Design team in 2001 and has been a vice president of Hardware Engineering since 2013. Throughout his tenure at Apple, John has overseen hardware engineering work on a variety of groundbreaking products including every generation and model of iPad, the latest iPhone lineup, and AirPods. He has been a key leader in the ongoing transition of the Mac to Apple silicon.\"\n\nThat makes him the equal and opposite of Craig Federighi, Apple's SVP of Software Engineering.\n\nAnyone needing to put a face to the name need only watch the video for the recent \"Let Loose\" event. Cook opened and closed the event, but Ternus acted as master of ceremonies.\n\nBig questions remain. If Turnus becomes the next Apple CEO, can he continue Cook's successful approach? Even more importantly, does he have Steve Jobs's vision to create the next big project that Apple fans need -- even if they don't know it yet?

diversifying into new product lines such as the Apple Watch and services like streaming video.\n\nNow, though, Cook's long-tenured executive team is aging, and some are beginning to speculate about his eventual replacement.\n\nWhile Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams would likely be in charge if Cook were to leave any time soon, a Bloomberg report says that hardware engineering chief John Ternus is the top candidate to eventually replace him if Cook hangs on for at least three more years as planned.\n\nAt 49, Ternus is relatively young compared to many other top Apple executives and is seen as someone with the potential to helm the company long-term.\n\nHe has assumed a public role that is increasingly high profile, headlining recent product launches like the recently concluded Let Loose event and speaking about the company's environmental efforts.\n\nThose who have worked with Ternus describe him as well-liked and good at collaboration across Apple's hardware and software teams.\n\nHe is also hands-on, often working directly with engineers to fix problems rather than managing through layers of middle management.\n\nOne former vice president, who worked with Ternus, vouched for his ability and personality, not like some other Apple executives who have reputations for abrasive management styles in emulation of Jobs's famously uncompromising leadership.\n\nWhile a transition may not happen for years, the Bloomberg report signals Ternus is being groomed for an eventual CEO role to helm Apple's next chapter whenever Cook decides to retire after over a decade atop the world's most valuable public company.\n\nJohn Ternus, Apple's hardware engineering chief, is emerging as a leading candidate to succeed Tim Cook, particularly if Cook remains in his role for at least three more years.\n\nTernus is known for his hands-on approach and ability to collaborate effectively across different teams at Apple.\n\nHis increasing visibility in public roles and involvement in key projects highlight his leadership capabilities.\n\nYes, Jeff Williams, Apple's Chief Operating Officer, is seen as the likely successor if Tim Cook were to leave his position in the near future, due to his current role and experience within the company.\n\nUnlike some executives who are known for their abrasive styles, Ternus is well-liked within Apple for his cooperative and hands-on approach to leadership, which aligns well with Apple's culture of collaboration.\n\nWhile there's no confirmed timeline for Cook's retirement, it is speculated that he may continue as CEO for at least three more years.\n\nThis timeline allows for a well-planned transition to potentially groom Ternus for the role.\n\nAlso Read: Tim Cook Reveals Key Traits for Success at Apple in Recent

Here's what latest report suggests", "body": "A recent report offers insights into the potential candidates who could replace Tim Cook as Apple's CEO, a position he has held since 2011 and will turn 64 this year. While the report suggests that a leadership change isn't imminent, it explores various possibilities for Cook's eventual successor.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has been Steve Jobs' successor since his retirement in 2011. As his career comes to an end, the question arises: who will succeed Tim Cook as Apple CEO? Cook has undoubtedly pushed Apple to new heights, and his resignation will be accompanied by a great deal of responsibility.\n\nCook filled in large shoes as CEO, taking the post from founder Steve Jobs in 2011. The Bloomberg report noted that change of leadership was not \"imminent\", but Jobs had handpicked his successor, and we could expect the same from Cook. Sources told the publication they expect Cook to remain for at least another three more years.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the top contender is Jeff Williams, Apple's current Chief Operating Officer who has been with the business for 25 years. He has expertise in operations and management, but his age may work against him.\n\nOther names include Craig Federighi, who leads the software engineering department, and Deirdre O'Brien, who oversees the company's worldwide retail operations, according to the newspaper. Both of them possess important talents and expertise. Similarly, executives like Phil Schiller and Dan Riccio are considered to be nearing the end of their tenures at Apple, making them less probable candidates for the CEO position.\n\nAnother strong possibility is John Ternus, Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering.

A look at the likely next CEO John Ternus", "body": "As Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to turn 64 this year, speculation has emerged about who could likely replace him at the helm of the tech giant. As per a recent Bloomberg report, the candidate most likely to take the post is long-time loyalist and hardware engineering chief John Ternus.\n\nKnown for spearheading the Apple iPad, AirPods and latest iPhone series, Ternus' name popped up from among other suitables at the company, including Chief Operating Officer (COO) Jeff Williams, Bloomberg reported.\n\nCook filled in large shoes as CEO, taking the post from founder Steve Jobs in 2011. The Bloomberg report noted that change of leadership was not \"imminent\", but Jobs had handpicked his successor, and we could expect the same from Cook. Sources told the publication they expect Cook to remain for at least another three more years.\n\nAccording to Apple's official website, Ternus is the company's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. He oversees all hardware engineering efforts, including those for iPhone, iPad, Mac, AirPods, and other products. He reports directly to Cook, it added.\n\nTernus joined Apple's Product Design team in 2001 and has held the position of vice president of Hardware Engineering since 2013. During his time at Apple, Ternus has supervised the engineering of products, such as all generations and models of iPad, the latest iPhone series, and AirPods. He has played a crucial role in leading the Mac's transition to Apple silicon, the website added.\n\nBefore his tenure at Apple, Ternus served as a mechanical engineer at Virtual Research Systems. He earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile Williams was dismissed as the next CEO after Cook due to his age (61 this year), the Bloomberg report noted that any immediate change could see him take the reigns. It cited sources saying that long-term the Apple board would favour an executive who could take the post for at least a decade -- similar to Jobs' and Cook's tenures.\n\nSimilarly, other \"unlikely\" candidates include Craig Federighi (Senior Vice President - Software Engineering), Deirdre O'Brien (Senior Vice President - Retail), Phil Schiller (Apple Fellow) and Dan Riccio (Senior Vice President - Hardware Engineering), the report cited sources saying.\n\nSo, why is Ternus favoured? He is currently Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering and is \"well-liked inside Apple and earned Cook's respect\", the report said.\n\n\"Tim likes him a lot because he can give a good presentation, he's very mild-mannered, never puts anything into an email that is controversial and is a very reticent decision-maker. He has a lot of managerial characteristics like Tim,\" one source told the publication.\n\nThe report also cited sources saying that Cook's closest executive, Eddy Cue, has also hinted at Ternus taking the CEO spot next.\n\n\"Everything that I have learned while reporting the story points to John Ternus. He is not even 50 years old. He's Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering. He joined Apple's executive team in 2021. He has quickly risen through the ranks ... And he's become an increasingly important face at the company. He's been increasingly promoted in their marketing. He's dealing with regulators in terms of right-to-repair laws. So, he's becoming a bigger part of the Apple story. And just this week, Apple unveiled some new tech, and Cook called on Ternus at that event to introduce those new products to the public,\" Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said.\n\nMilestone Alert!

With the new \"MacBook-like\" Magic Keyboard and landscape-oriented camera system, it's getting a bit awkward. Just make a touchscreen Mac already, Apple. Or, at least, let us boot macOS on the iPad if it has everything it needs to be a MacBook: M-series chip, keyboard, trackpad.\n\nSo why isn't Apple making the obvious moves here? Legacy, I believe. And so I originally titled yesterday's column as \"Apple: Generations\" - that is, it feels like a lot of what Apple does these days is to adhere to what they have been doing over the past couple of decades. And that, I believe, is in no small part because almost all of the executive team has been in place over that entire time. Dating back to the Steve Jobs-era. The savior, quite literally, of Apple.\n\nIn order for Apple to truly come up with \"what's next\" is it time to start thinking about who's next? Anyway, timely report from Mark Gurman on that very topic:\n\nSeveral people familiar with Apple's inner workings recently discussed the issue with Bloomberg Businessweek, requesting anonymity to speak about the sensitive subject. If Cook were to step down soon, these people say, he would almost assuredly be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who emerged as the top candidate to be Cook's successor a few years ago. In 2015, Cook named Williams Apple's first COO since Cook himself held that role under Jobs. That same year, Williams shepherded the first major new product in the Cook era, the Apple Watch, to market. And, four years later, he replaced Ive as the head of hardware and software design.\n\nBut Williams, who's 61 this year, is only two years Cook's junior, and company insiders say they think it's now unlikely he'll be the new long-term chief. Apple's board would probably want an executive who, like Cook and Jobs, would stick around for at least a decade. \"If you asked me five years ago, it was very clear Jeff was leading the pack to become CEO,\" says one longtime Apple executive. \"But the slowness to refresh the C-suite leaves a problem with who you can bring on board.\"\n\nCook, as Gurman notes, seems likely to stick around at least another few years. If nothing else, this will give him some time to keep pushing the just-launched Vision Pro, in the hope it can find its stride as the Apple Watch has. He undoubtedly doesn't want to go out with the large question marks around it today.\n\nAnd to the point above, this probably takes Williams out of the running as the next CEO of Apple. Not because he's too old - though he is basically the same age as Cook - but because of the desire to put someone in place who will be there indefinitely, not someone who will lead to renewed succession talk almost immediately.\n\nIf Cook were to stay that long, people within Apple say, the most likely successor would be John Ternus, the hardware engineering chief. In a company whose success has always come from building category-defining gadgets, the ascension of a hardware engineering expert to the CEO job would seem logical. Ternus, who's not yet 50, would also be more likely than other members of the executive team to stick around for a long time, potentially providing another decade or more of Cook-esque stability.\n\nA few years ago, Ternus wouldn't have been on many peoples' radars, let alone as the front-runner to be the next Apple CEO. But there's no denying just how much Apple has been pushing him on up stage in the past couple of years. It's quite overt. To the point where I've noted it many times. Including, of course, this week:\n\nI worry that today's Apple is still living in the shadow of Jobs. It's hardly surprising given that he was both the founder and savior of the company. But it's likely exacerbated by the fact that most of the key core executives today are still from Jobs' era and lineage. Schiller. Jeff Williams. Eddy Cue. Greg Joswiak. Sabih Khan. Johny Srouj. Deirdre O'Brien. Craig Federighi. Even the star of yesterday's show, the relative fresh-faced (in terms of being forward-facing - and clearly being set up for bigger things) Ternus has been at Apple since 2001. And, of course, Tim Cook. That's 9 of the 12 executives who have been there since the Jobs era - a few of them there before Jobs came back!\n\nYes, Ternus has been at Apple for 22 years, nearly half his life. If you want \"fresh blood\" he's not the pick. At the same time, he might be the perfect middle ground between the old guard and a complete outsider because he started at Apple quite junior and was only elevated to the executive tier three years ago. As Gurman reports, while he was at Apple for a long run of the Steve Jobs era, he was too junior to work with Jobs directly much, if at all. Again, he could be a good middle ground between old and new here.\n\nAnd again, it's clearly no accident that Apple keeps pushing him on stage. For a while it seemed like they were doing this to Craig Federighi. But now it seems almost like he's more of an MC for events like WWDC as he's far more charismatic on stage than Tim Cook is. In presentations, Ternus seems a bit of a hybrid between Cook and Federighi, as I wrote last year:\n\nAnother name that comes to mind that is very good on-stage and on-screen? Someone who wasn't showcased at all yesterday: Craig Federighi. Also, don't overlook John Ternus, who has a quiet presence that resonates.\n\nThough I'm not sure he's done an actual live event yet, only many of these taped presentations. WWDC could be interesting/telling that regard.\n\nAnyway, a lot of interesting, if anecdotal tidbits about Ternus in Gurman's story. You always have to take such things with a grain of salt because anyone - certainly someone in the running for the top job - will have both boosters and detractors. But again, I think the most important thing to read here is just what Apple is doing with him, which is, clearly putting him front-and-center. That's not an accident.\n\nEach spring, Apple holds what it calls the Top 100 -- a private executive offsite typically held in California's Carmel Valley that brings together the most important people at the company. This March, Ternus was a prominent presence, helming the presentation of the company's technology roadmap. He'd led this talk before, but more in the capacity of an emcee while a range of lieutenants went over individual areas. This year, he conducted the presentation himself. One person with knowledge of the event says the implication was clear: \"He's being groomed.\"\n\nYou know who else was at his company for 22 years before being elevated to the top job?

Although the current CEO of Apple will never be remembered as the legend that Steve Jobs created, he has managed to give the company a neat, clean and impeccable image. Furthermore, Apple's fiscal results show good sales figures and Tim Cook's decisions are largely to blame.\n\nTim Cook has generally done a great job at the helm of Apple since 2011. However, Tim Cook is getting older and older and will turn 64 this year. Although there is no reason to assume that his leadership will end anytime soon, we already believe we know who his successor will be.\n\nSources with knowledge of the ins and outs of Apple's policy They have spoken with Bloomberg to reveal who could be the future CEO of Apple.\n\nThe information coming from Bloomberg, based on conversations with people familiar with the matter, details that \"if the change were to happen soon\" the new CEO of Apple would probably be Jeff Williams.\n\nJeff Williams currently works as Apple's chief operating officer, reporting to CEO Tim Cook. His work is commendable and he has a very good reputation in his career within the bitten apple logo company.\n\nIf Tim Cook were to leave soon, these people say, he would almost certainly be replaced by chief operating officer Jeff Williams, who emerged as the best candidate to be Tim Cook's successor a few years ago.\n\nNow, Jeff Williams is 61 years old and has only been under the wings of Tim Cook for two years. Some people inside the company think there is not much chance that Jeff Williams will be the next CEO for many years.\n\nApple certainly needs a new CEO who will remain at the helm for at least a decade.\n\nAn Apple executive who has been with the company for many years has been very candid about what he thinks about Jeff Williams' candidacy as Apple CEO:\n\nIf you had asked me five years ago, it was very clear that Jeff was leading to become CEO. But the slowness in the process leaves us with a problem when it comes to bringing someone in charge.\n\nIn principle, it is thought that Tim Cook, who earns around 60 million a year, will remain CEO of Apple for at least another three years.\n\nBut there is another possible candidate for CEO of Apple who has more chances than Jeff Williams to become the boss of the Cupertino company. We are talking about John Ternus, who is currently Apple's vice president of hardware engineering.\n\nJohn Ternus is Tim Cook's most likely long-term successor. Even more than Jeff Williams himself. He is younger, 49 years old, and is very popular among Apple's management.\n\nHe (John Ternus) has earned the respect of Tim Cook, Jeff Williams and other leaders.

Cook stepped into significant responsibilities as CEO, succeeding founder Steve Jobs in 2011. A Bloomberg report identifies John Ternus (49), current head of hardware engineering and a long-serving Apple veteran, as the likely candidate. Ternus has been instrumental in leading significant projects such as the iPad, AirPods, and the latest iPhone series.\n\nTernus joined Apple in 2001, starting his journey in the Product Design team. He climbed the ranks to become Vice President of Hardware Engineering in 2013. His tenure has seen him oversee the engineering of all iPad models, recent iPhone series, and AirPods. In 2021, he joined Apple's executive team, becoming an increasingly influential figure within the company. Ternus has also played a crucial role in guiding Mac's transition to Apple silicon.\n\nBefore joining Apple, Ternus was a mechanical engineer at Virtual Research Systems. He earned his Mechanical Engineering degree from University of Pennsylvania. Ternus is well-regarded within Apple. An insider told Bloomberg, \"Tim likes him a lot because he can give a good presentation, he's very mild-mannered, never puts anything into an email that is controversial and is a very reticent decision-maker.\" Eddy Cue, one of Cook's closest executives, also hints at Ternus being the next CEO.\n\nWhile other potential successors like Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams (61) were considered, they were ultimately ruled out due to age considerations. Bloomberg suggests that Williams could potentially step in as an interim leader if an immediate change occurs. However, for a long-term solution, Apple's board would prefer an executive who could serve for at least 10 years, favoring Ternus due to his current position and standing within the company.\n\nAs per the report, other \"unlikely\" candidates include Craig Federighi (Senior Vice President - Software Engineering), Deirdre O'Brien (Senior Vice President - Retail), Phil Schiller (Apple Fellow), and Dan Riccio (Senior Vice President - Hardware Engineering).", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPods", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AirPods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ternus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Ternus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_transition_to_Apple_silicon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mac transition to Apple silicon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Product design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Pennsylvania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deirdre O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Riccio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Riccio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Federighi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_Cue", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddy Cue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Williams (Apple)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/History/Pioneers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/History/Pioneers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Programmable_Logic", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Programmable Logic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Engineering", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/CAD_and_CAM/PTC_Pro_Engineer", "label": "dmoz/Computers/CAD and CAM/PTC Pro Engineer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l29320240509164359.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551912", "eventUri": "eng-9551912", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Here's What The Latest Report Suggests", "body": "A recent report from Bloomberg offers insights into the potential candidates who could replace Tim Cook as Apple's CEO, a position he has held since 2011 and will turn 64 this year. While the report suggests that a leadership change isn't imminent, it explores various possibilities for Cook's eventual successor.\n\nIf Tim Cook were to step down in the near future, Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams would likely step into the role of CEO, according to sources familiar with Apple's internal dynamics. Williams, 61, emerged as the top contender for the position some years ago. However, concerns about his age and long-term commitment to the role have raised doubts among company insiders about his suitability as a long-term CEO.\n\nWith speculation that Tim Cook will remain CEO for at least another three years, John Ternus emerges as the most probable successor. Currently serving as Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering, Ternus has garnered admiration within Apple for his leadership qualities and managerial skills. At 49 years old, he is seen as more likely to provide stable leadership for the company over the long term.\n\nOther Executive Contenders\n\nWhile individuals such as Craig Federighi and Deirdre O'Brien are well-regarded within Apple, they are deemed unlikely to succeed Cook due to various factors. Similarly, executives like Phil Schiller and Dan Riccio are considered to be nearing the end of their tenures at Apple, making them less probable candidates for the CEO position.\n\nSEE ALSO: iPad Pro 2024 Vs iPad Pro 2022; All The Key Differences You Should Know Before Buying", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Williams (Apple)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ternus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Ternus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deirdre O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Riccio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Riccio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Federighi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Schiller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Schiller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices/Veganism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices/Veganism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Confectionery", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Confectionery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/t/mashable_in/photo/default/2_95dj.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551912", "eventUri": "eng-9551912", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Since then, the company has a market capitalization of a whopping $2.65 trillion. To even think about that number is daunting, they have a worth that only organizations such as the Department of Defense are handling.

He doesn't even make it to the Top 1,000 of the richest.\n\nUder Tim Cook, Apple has released amazing products such as the Apple Watch or the Apple AirPods. Instead of investing at Apple, the CEO currently owns a very small percentage of the company's stock shares. That is where he gets his revenue from. As of last October, 2023. Tim Cook held 3,280,052 shares of Apple's common stock. This information was initially reported by Forbes. After the major sell-off last year, Cook sold 241,000 shares and made a reported $41.4 million in cash after taxes. But Cook still maintains .02% stake in the company that translates into roughly $561 million.\n\nYou would think that having one of the highest positions in the big tech world would make you one of the wealthiest people in the world but Tim Cook doesn't operate like that. Despite not even making the thousandth wealthiest person in the world, Forbes estimates he is worth a reported $2.5 billion.

Candidates include COO Jeff Williams and hardware chief John Ternus. Cook's tenure marked by product expansion and financial success, but finding a visionary successor poses challenges for the tech giant.Tim Cook picked up the mantle from Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple over a decade ago and grew it into a multi-trillion dollar company. Now, as Cook nears traditional retirement age, speculation abounds about who will succeed him.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman joins host David Gura to discuss the challenges of replacing Cook, his potential successors and how that decision will impact one of the best-known brands in the world.\n\nHere is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:\n\nDavid Gura: Every year, the top executives at Apple - of course, one of the largest and most influential companies in the world - are whisked away to an idyllic retreat usually in Carmel Valley.\n\nThat's about 90 miles south of the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California. So, many of these execs travel by bus.\n\nMark Gurman: They can't bring their family, they can't bring their assistants. These are the 100 most important people at Apple.\n\nGura: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has covered Apple for almost 15 years, and he says this annual meeting is one of the most important dates on the company's calendar.\n\nIt's something Steve Jobs started.\n\nGurman: They sit in auditoriums, different rooms of this beautiful resort in Northern California. They are taught and shown all of the goodness that's to come from Apple in the years to come.\n\nGura: It was at this retreat that Apple's so-called \"Top 100\" got a first look at the original iPad, Mark says.\n\nThey saw the MacBook Air and the Apple Watch. And got updates on the Apple Car project, which the company just scrapped.\n\nGurman: This is where you go to learn about Apple's future.\n\nGura: And while most of the focus is on product presentations - and prototypes, Apple's senior leaders are also taking note of who among them has been picked to make these presentations.\n\nGurman: I think the people at that event are probably always naturally trying to figure out who's next in line. Who's in charge?\n\nGura: That is ... who will eventually replace Tim Cook.\n\nJobs' hand-picked successor has been the CEO of Apple for nearly thirteen years. He was Jobs' deputy before that.\n\nGura: At Apple, succession planning is the elephant in the room, and even though Cook hasn't indicated he plans to leave the company anytime soon, Mark says there is growing speculation about when that'll happen who will be its next chief executive - and whether that person is in this group of Apple's most important people.\n\nGurman: We're nearing sort of the end of Cook's tenure at Apple, probably, right? He's going to turn 65 next year. He's older than most CEOs in the S&P 500. He's been at Apple for 25 years and Apple's at a precarious position because the executive team where they likely would choose their next CEO from most of the people on that executive team are all about 60 years old, or would probably be in their mid to late sixties by the time Tim Cook retires, leaving the company with very few reasonable options.\n\nGura: Today on the show:\n\nThe challenges of finding someone who could do one of the most demanding jobs in business.\n\nWho's in the running, and how that decision will impact a $2.8 trillion company, and one of the best-known brands in the world.\n\nI'm David Gura, and this is The Big Take, from Bloomberg News.\n\nGura: Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.\n\nAnd part of his job involves planning for who will succeed him. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says it's not the easiest job to fill.\n\nGura: Is that job description really well fleshed out? In other words, what does an Apple CEO need to be able to do?\n\nGurman: An Apple CEO needs to either be the visionary to bring new products to market. Or needs to be able to find who the visionary is and partner with that visionary to bring those new products to market.\n\nGura: It's a challenge that wasn't lost on Steve Jobs when he tapped Cook for the job.\n\nGurman: You know, the thing about Cook is that it is all consuming, and I think one of the reasons that Jobs made him the CEO, other than the fact that he was the most qualified, probably by a long shot, amongst the executive team at the time, is that Jobs knew how all consuming the next era of Apple would be, right?\n\nAnd Tim's entire life for the most part, based on everyone who knows him and everyone you speak to about him is Apple.\n\nGura: Cook became Apple's CEO in 2011, under intense scrutiny.\n\nHe took over for Jobs, the company's founder, who was battling pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnd in October of that year, Cook stepped into the spotlight, to unveil a new version of the iPhone:\n\nTim Cook: Good morning. This is my first product launch since being named CEO. I'm sure you didn't know that.\n\nGura: You can hear him cracking a joke to acknowledge what a big moment this was. He was under immense pressure - following in Jobs' footsteps.\n\nCook: I Love Apple. And I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for almost 14 years.\n\nGura: As Apple's chief operating officer, Cook worked side-by-side with Jobs, during a period when Apple grew at breakneck speed. When it became much more than a computer company.\n\nCook: Just ten years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music.\n\nGura: Mark, you covered that transition in 2011. What can you tell us about the relationship between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook?\n\nGurman: They were close. I wouldn't say that they were best friends. Uh, I would say in many ways they were, uh, partners. Steve Jobs was the design mind. He was the person dreaming up these new products, and Tim Cook was the execution guy. He was the person for all intents and purposes, who was able to bring these products to market, get them manufactured, get them into retail stores, and so forth. And then when Steve Jobs stepped down and then ultimately passed away, what Apple lost was sort of that visionary to dream up new types of product categories, new designs, new user experiences\n\nGura: Jobs died on October 5th, 2011 - one day after Cook unveiled that new iPhone.\n\nAnd in the years that followed, Cook made sure Apple continued to build on the runaway success of that device.\n\nGurman: The Apple watch for all intents and purposes is an accessory or an extension of the iPhone. Airpods are an extension to the iPhone, an accessory to the iPhone. What Tim Cook has done, he's taken the product lines that Steve Jobs created and envisioned, and supercharged them. When Steve Jobs passed, there was only one iPad model, the iPad 2.\n\nToday, there are five, or even more iPad models available right now. The iPhone went from one or two different models to several different models. So what Tim Cook has been able to do is squeeze so much juice out of the lemons that are those original Apple form factors.\n\nGura: Under his leadership, Apple added products and services, along with new accessories.\n\nThe company branched into movies and TV.\n\nIt introduced an Apple credit card.\n\nGurman: At its core, I think Apple is still very much a technology company, but they like to position themselves as well as a lifestyle company.\n\nGura: Now, more than a decade into his tenure, do you see this company as Tim Cook's Apple, or is it still Steve Jobs' Apple that, that Tim Cook is the steward of?\n\nGurman: I think it's actually a mix of both. At its very core, Steve Jobs left Apple with something, you know, more than pretty good in the iPhone. And Tim Cook, I would say, has probably made the most of what he was left with. I don't think anyone could have done a better job following in the footsteps as legendary as someone like Steve Jobs.\n\nGura: People worried Steve Jobs would be irreplaceable, but now, there's a sense Tim Cook's shoes will be hard to fill.\n\nGurman: So The question is Apple moving forward, who was that new person to lead Apple into a new era with a new vision, with new types of products. And that's really what Apple needs to come up with to create its next 15 years.\n\nGura: There are a handful of names that come up in conversations about CEO succession at Apple.\n\nBut over the years, as Mark has reported on this, there's been a clear frontrunner.\n\nGurman: He can own the stage. He can talk the talk with government officials from China to Europe to the US. If something happened unexpectedly to Cook, I don't think Apple would miss a beat.\n\nGura: So, who is Apple's heir apparent? And who else is waiting in the wings, vying for the top job? That's after the break.\n\nGura: Before Tim Cook became Apple's CEO, he was the chief operating officer under Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd when it comes to who will replace Cook, his current COO could easily be next in line:\n\nCook: And to tell us about some progress in this area, I'd like to invite up Jeff Williams. Jeff?\n\nGura: That's Cook introducing Jeff Williams at a product launch in 2016:\n\nWilliams: Last year, we introduced Research Kit. And our goal was to use technology to solve some of the biggest problems\n\nGura: Williams has been C-O-O for almost a decade now. He joined the company in 1998.\n\nGurman: Right now, he runs Apple's entire operations. He's in charge of the Apple supply chain.\n\nHe's in charge of Apple's health care efforts. He's in charge of Apple watch hardware and software engineering. He was in charge of the Apple car. He's involved with the Apple vision pro headset, and he's in charge of Apple's hardware and software design organization. So he has so much in his portfolio already, and he would be able to be a shoo-in pretty easily for Cook if something were to happen.\n\nA lot of people have called him Tim Cook's Tim Cook.\n\nGura: And like Cook, Williams grew up in the South, he got an MBA from Duke, and had a stint at IBM before joining Apple.\n\nBut there's something else these two have in common. They're both in their early sixties.\n\nGurman: He's only two years younger than Cook.\n\nGura: And that could make William's path to succeeding Cook complicated.\n\nGurman: If Cook retires in three to five years, you can't name a 66 year old Jeff Williams as CEO of Apple. Right? The Street, the market, the employees, the board, probably wouldn't be terribly fond of that idea. You can't set up someone for a two to five year tenure as a new CEO of a company as big and as important as Apple.\n\nGura: This is not just an issue with Williams, though.\n\nWhen you go down the list of other potential candidates among Apple's top management, a trend emerges.\n\nMark says many members of the company's leadership team are also hovering around retirement age.\n\nAnd turnover at the executive level is pretty rare.\n\nGurman: When you're a Senior Vice President at Apple, you're essentially the CEO of a major division, right? You're at one of the most successful companies in the world. You're also getting paid $25 million per year as an Apple Senior Vice President. So from a financial standpoint, it's very worthwhile to stay around. But I think the people in Apple's executive team, they're motivated by more than money. I think there's a sense that a lot of these folks are very much motivated by the power that comes with being in that role. And so power is sometimes hard to give up.\n\nGura: Mark says, if it's not Williams, there are a few other candidates who are likely in the running.\n\nThey're all currently on the Apple payroll. Tim Cook himself has said he hopes the board taps someone from within the company. And they have their own trade-offs.\n\nFinding a single person who can do everything that an Apple CEO needs to do is a real challenge.\n\nOne potential candidate is on his second stint at Apple:\n\nGurman: Craig Federighi, who's in charge of software engineering.\n\nGura: But, Mark says?\n\nGurman: Federighi probably doesn't have the business acumen to run the whole company.\n\nGura: There's also Deirdre O'Brien, who oversees Apple's sprawling retail operation worldwide.\n\nGurman: And before that, Uh, she was one of the company's top executives on operations and sales.\n\nGura: But according to Mark? ...\n\nGurman: Apple probably wants to try something new for a new era and not go with another operations or an HR person.\n\nGura: But Mark has identified another candidate. Who, with his age and experience, is a strong contender.\n\nGurman: Everything that I have learned while reporting the story points to a guy named John Ternus.\n\nHe is not even 50 years old. He's Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.\n\nHe joined Apple's executive team in 2021. He has quickly risen through the ranks. He used to be a VP in charge of Mac computer engineering. He eventually added the iPad, added AirPods. More recently, he added the iPhone and the Apple watch. And now he's in charge of basically all of the money making hardware for Apple.\n\nAnd he's become an increasingly important face at the company. He's been increasingly promoted in their marketing. He's dealing with regulators in terms of right to repair laws. So he's becoming a bigger part of the Apple story.\n\nGura: Mark says Ternus had a marquee role this year, at that annual executive conference in Northern California.\n\nAnd just this week, Apple unveiled some new tech, and Cook called on Ternus at that event to introduce those new products to the public.\n\nTim Cook: So here's John to tell you more. ...\n\nJohn Ternus: Let's kick things off with iPad Air.\n\nGura: Mark says Ternus' prospects of becoming Apple's next CEO get better the longer Cook sticks around.\n\nAnd there is no indication he plans to retire anytime soon.\n\nExecutives are not under the same pressure they used to be, to retire in their mid-Sixties.\n\nGura: Mark, I wonder if you could situate this conversation in kind of a broader cultural sea change we're seeing. Bob Iger back at Disney in his 70s. That must in some way sort of liberate Tim Cook to look perhaps at a longer tenure at Apple.\n\nGurman: Yeah, that's a very good point. Certainly the next U. S. president is going to be in their 80s during their tenure. You have Pat Gelsinger, who's the CEO of Intel. He was named to that role three years ago when he was about 60. So certainly you do have some older statesmen there with Tim Cook, you know, one of the, the, the older ones and Apple appreciates, as some people tell me, the people with gray hair there, that means they have experience and wisdom, and they've been around the block a few times. There is nothing that Tim Cook hasn't seen, and wisdom goes a long way for being an Apple executive.\n\nGura: For his part, Cook has a lot of unfinished business he's attending to right now:\n\nApple's seen a slowdown in sales, the company is taking hits from regulators - in the US and the European Union, and after Apple's adventure in automobile manufacturing came to a screeching halt, it's under pressure to deliver something new.\n\nAll of that, and more, is on Cook's plate, and Mark says no one is pushing him to step aside.\n\nGurman: There's no mandatory retirement age. And I would say that even if there was, uh, they'd rip that up or shred it or light it on fire to let Cook stay around as long as he wants to. Because he's been effective, Wall Street loves him. The stock price has surely been positively reflected by Cook's tenure.\n\nAnd so I think Tim Cook is going to be the CEO of Apple as long as he wants to be the CEO of Apple and he won't step down a day before that.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs",

There's no doubt Cook has taken Apple to new heights and made it a multi-trillion dollar company and it will be a huge responsibility after Cook steps down. Well, again the question arises, who will fill the Cook's shoes?\n\nWell, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman with host David Gura delved into the topic shedding some light on the challenges of finding the right candidate for the position. He came up with a few names and said it would be a significant challenge for the board in identifying Cook's successor.\n\nREAD: PS5 Slim Price Discounts: Gamers Will Get Rs 5,000 Off On New PlayStation 5 Slim But For Few Days\n\nAmong the front runners, the report suggested that Jeff Williams, Apple's current Chief Operating Officer, working with the company for a quarter-century is the contender. He has experience in managing operations and management positions, however, his age could raise questions about the longevity of his tenure if appointed as CEO.\n\nOther contenders include Craig Federighi, spearheading software engineering efforts, and Deirdre O'Brien, overseeing the company's global retail operations, the report added. Both of them have notable skills and experience. Another contender emerging on the horizon is John Ternus, Apple's Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering. He's a decade younger than other contenders and has experience in key areas including product development and regulatory affairs.\n\nREAD: Android 15 May Bring 'Super Dark Mode' For Users With Enhanced Optimisations; Details\n\nIt should be noted that Tim Cook has not hinted towards an imminent departure from the company but the board may reportedly face challenges in ensuring a smoother transition when the time comes.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PlayStation 5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Jobs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Williams_(Apple)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Williams (Apple)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ternus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Ternus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deirdre_O'Brien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deirdre O'Brien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Federighi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Federighi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Confectionery", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Confectionery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://imgeng.jagran.com/images/2024/05/09/article/image/Apple CEO Tim Cook-1715235727016.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551912", "eventUri": "eng-9551912", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1615, "textEnd": 1621}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Now, as Cook nears traditional retirement age, speculation abounds about who will succeed him.\n\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman joins host David Gura to discuss the challenges of replacing Cook, his potential successors and how that decision will impact one of the best-known brands in the world.\n\nHere is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation:\n\nDavid Gura: Every year, the top executives at Apple - of course, one of the largest and most influential companies in the world - are whisked away to an idyllic retreat usually in Carmel Valley.\n\nThat's about 90 miles south of the company's headquarters, in Cupertino, California. So, many of these execs travel by bus.\n\nMark Gurman: They can't bring their family, they can't bring their assistants. These are the 100 most important people at Apple.\n\nGura: Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has covered Apple for almost 15 years, and he says this annual meeting is one of the most important dates on the company's calendar.\n\nIt's something Steve Jobs started.\n\nGurman: They sit in auditoriums, different rooms of this beautiful resort in Northern California. They are taught and shown all of the goodness that's to come from Apple in the years to come.\n\nGura: It was at this retreat that Apple's so-called \"Top 100\" got a first look at the original iPad, Mark says.\n\nThey saw the MacBook Air and the Apple Watch. And got updates on the Apple Car project, which the company just scrapped.\n\nGurman: This is where you go to learn about Apple's future.\n\nGura: And while most of the focus is on product presentations - and prototypes, Apple's senior leaders are also taking note of who among them has been picked to make these presentations.\n\nGurman: I think the people at that event are probably always naturally trying to figure out who's next in line. Who's in charge?\n\nGura: That is ... who will eventually replace Tim Cook.\n\nJobs' hand-picked successor has been the CEO of Apple for nearly thirteen years. He was Jobs' deputy before that.\n\nGura: At Apple, succession planning is the elephant in the room, and even though Cook hasn't indicated he plans to leave the company anytime soon, Mark says there is growing speculation about when that'll happen who will be its next chief executive - and whether that person is in this group of Apple's most important people.\n\nGurman: We're nearing sort of the end of Cook's tenure at Apple, probably, right? He's going to turn 65 next year. He's older than most CEOs in the S&P 500. He's been at Apple for 25 years and Apple's at a precarious position because the executive team where they likely would choose their next CEO from most of the people on that executive team are all about 60 years old, or would probably be in their mid to late sixties by the time Tim Cook retires, leaving the company with very few reasonable options.\n\nGura: Today on the show:\n\nThe challenges of finding someone who could do one of the most demanding jobs in business.\n\nWho's in the running, and how that decision will impact a $2.8 trillion company, and one of the best-known brands in the world.\n\nI'm David Gura, and this is The Big Take, from Bloomberg News.\n\nGura: Tim Cook has been the CEO of Apple for more than a decade.\n\nAnd part of his job involves planning for who will succeed him. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says it's not the easiest job to fill.\n\nGura: Is that job description really well fleshed out? In other words, what does an Apple CEO need to be able to do?\n\nGurman: An Apple CEO needs to either be the visionary to bring new products to market. Or needs to be able to find who the visionary is and partner with that visionary to bring those new products to market.\n\nGura: It's a challenge that wasn't lost on Steve Jobs when he tapped Cook for the job.\n\nGurman: You know, the thing about Cook is that it is all consuming, and I think one of the reasons that Jobs made him the CEO, other than the fact that he was the most qualified, probably by a long shot, amongst the executive team at the time, is that Jobs knew how all consuming the next era of Apple would be, right?\n\nAnd Tim's entire life for the most part, based on everyone who knows him and everyone you speak to about him is Apple.\n\nGura: Cook became Apple's CEO in 2011, under intense scrutiny.\n\nHe took over for Jobs, the company's founder, who was battling pancreatic cancer.\n\nAnd in October of that year, Cook stepped into the spotlight, to unveil a new version of the iPhone:\n\nTim Cook: Good morning. This is my first product launch since being named CEO. I'm sure you didn't know that.\n\nGura: You can hear him cracking a joke to acknowledge what a big moment this was. He was under immense pressure - following in Jobs' footsteps.\n\nCook: I Love Apple. And I consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for almost 14 years.\n\nGura: As Apple's chief operating officer, Cook worked side-by-side with Jobs, during a period when Apple grew at breakneck speed. When it became much more than a computer company.\n\nCook: Just ten years ago, we launched the original iPod here, and it went on to revolutionize the way we listen to music.\n\nGura: Mark, you covered that transition in 2011. What can you tell us about the relationship between Steve Jobs and Tim Cook?\n\nGurman: They were close. I wouldn't say that they were best friends. Uh, I would say in many ways they were, uh, partners. Steve Jobs was the design mind. He was the person dreaming up these new products, and Tim Cook was the execution guy. He was the person for all intents and purposes, who was able to bring these products to market, get them manufactured, get them into retail stores, and so forth. And then when Steve Jobs stepped down and then ultimately passed away, what Apple lost was sort of that visionary to dream up new types of product categories, new designs, new user experiences\n\nGura: Jobs died on October 5th, 2011 - one day after Cook unveiled that new iPhone.\n\nAnd in the years that followed, Cook made sure Apple continued to build on the runaway success of that device.\n\nGurman: The Apple watch for all intents and purposes is an accessory or an extension of the iPhone. Airpods are an extension to the iPhone, an accessory to the iPhone. What Tim Cook has done, he's taken the product lines that Steve Jobs created and envisioned, and supercharged them. When Steve Jobs passed, there was only one iPad model, the iPad 2.\n\nToday, there are five, or even more iPad models available right now. The iPhone went from one or two different models to several different models. So what Tim Cook has been able to do is squeeze so much juice out of the lemons that are those original Apple form factors.\n\nGura: Under his leadership, Apple added products and services, along with new accessories.\n\nThe company branched into movies and TV.\n\nIt introduced an Apple credit card.\n\nGurman: At its core, I think Apple is still very much a technology company, but they like to position themselves as well as a lifestyle company.\n\nGura: Now, more than a decade into his tenure, do you see this company as Tim Cook's Apple, or is it still Steve Jobs' Apple that, that Tim Cook is the steward of?\n\nGurman: I think it's actually a mix of both. At its very core, Steve Jobs left Apple with something, you know, more than pretty good in the iPhone. And Tim Cook, I would say, has probably made the most of what he was left with. I don't think anyone could have done a better job following in the footsteps as legendary as someone like Steve Jobs.\n\nGura: People worried Steve Jobs would be irreplaceable, but now, there's a sense Tim Cook's shoes will be hard to fill.\n\nGurman: So The question is Apple moving forward, who was that new person to lead Apple into a new era with a new vision, with new types of products. And that's really what Apple needs to come up with to create its next 15 years.\n\nGura: There are a handful of names that come up in conversations about CEO succession at Apple.\n\nBut over the years, as Mark has reported on this, there's been a clear frontrunner.\n\nGurman: He can own the stage. He can talk the talk with government officials from China to Europe to the US. If something happened unexpectedly to Cook, I don't think Apple would miss a beat.\n\nGura: So, who is Apple's heir apparent? And who else is waiting in the wings, vying for the top job? That's after the break.\n\nGura: Before Tim Cook became Apple's CEO, he was the chief operating officer under Steve Jobs.\n\nAnd when it comes to who will replace Cook, his current COO could easily be next in line:\n\nCook: And to tell us about some progress in this area, I'd like to invite up Jeff Williams. Jeff?\n\nGura: That's Cook introducing Jeff Williams at a product launch in 2016:\n\nWilliams: Last year, we introduced Research Kit. And our goal was to use technology to solve some of the biggest problems\n\nGura: Williams has been C-O-O for almost a decade now. He joined the company in 1998.\n\nGurman: Right now, he runs Apple's entire operations. He's in charge of the Apple supply chain.\n\nHe's in charge of Apple's health care efforts. He's in charge of Apple watch hardware and software engineering. He was in charge of the Apple car. He's involved with the Apple vision pro headset, and he's in charge of Apple's hardware and software design organization. So he has so much in his portfolio already, and he would be able to be a shoo-in pretty easily for Cook if something were to happen.\n\nA lot of people have called him Tim Cook's Tim Cook.\n\nGura: And like Cook, Williams grew up in the South, he got an MBA from Duke, and had a stint at IBM before joining Apple.\n\nBut there's something else these two have in common. They're both in their early sixties.\n\nGurman: He's only two years younger than Cook.\n\nGura: And that could make William's path to succeeding Cook complicated.\n\nGurman: If Cook retires in three to five years, you can't name a 66 year old Jeff Williams as CEO of Apple. Right? The Street, the market, the employees, the board, probably wouldn't be terribly fond of that idea. You can't set up someone for a two to five year tenure as a new CEO of a company as big and as important as Apple.\n\nGura: This is not just an issue with Williams, though.\n\nWhen you go down the list of other potential candidates among Apple's top management, a trend emerges.\n\nMark says many members of the company's leadership team are also hovering around retirement age.\n\nAnd turnover at the executive level is pretty rare.\n\nGurman: When you're a Senior Vice President at Apple, you're essentially the CEO of a major division, right? You're at one of the most successful companies in the world. You're also getting paid $25 million per year as an Apple Senior Vice President. So from a financial standpoint, it's very worthwhile to stay around. But I think the people in Apple's executive team, they're motivated by more than money. I think there's a sense that a lot of these folks are very much motivated by the power that comes with being in that role. And so power is sometimes hard to give up.\n\nGura: Mark says, if it's not Williams, there are a few other candidates who are likely in the running.\n\nThey're all currently on the Apple payroll. Tim Cook himself has said he hopes the board taps someone from within the company. And they have their own trade-offs.\n\nFinding a single person who can do everything that an Apple CEO needs to do is a real challenge.\n\nOne potential candidate is on his second stint at Apple:\n\nGurman: Craig Federighi, who's in charge of software engineering.\n\nGura: But, Mark says?\n\nGurman: Federighi probably doesn't have the business acumen to run the whole company.\n\nGura: There's also Deirdre O'Brien, who oversees Apple's sprawling retail operation worldwide.\n\nGurman: And before that, Uh, she was one of the company's top executives on operations and sales.\n\nGura: But according to Mark? ...\n\nGurman: Apple probably wants to try something new for a new era and not go with another operations or an HR person.\n\nGura: But Mark has identified another candidate. Who, with his age and experience, is a strong contender.\n\nGurman: Everything that I have learned while reporting the story points to a guy named John Ternus.\n\nHe is not even 50 years old. He's Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering.\n\nHe joined Apple's executive team in 2021. He has quickly risen through the ranks. He used to be a VP in charge of Mac computer engineering. He eventually added the iPad, added AirPods. More recently, he added the iPhone and the Apple watch. And now he's in charge of basically all of the money making hardware for Apple.\n\nAnd he's become an increasingly important face at the company. He's been increasingly promoted in their marketing. He's dealing with regulators in terms of right to repair laws. So he's becoming a bigger part of the Apple story.\n\nGura: Mark says Ternus had a marquee role this year, at that annual executive conference in Northern California.\n\nAnd just this week, Apple unveiled some new tech, and Cook called on Ternus at that event to introduce those new products to the public.\n\nTim Cook: So here's John to tell you more. ...\n\nJohn Ternus: Let's kick things off with iPad Air.\n\nGura: Mark says Ternus' prospects of becoming Apple's next CEO get better the longer Cook sticks around.\n\nAnd there is no indication he plans to retire anytime soon.\n\nExecutives are not under the same pressure they used to be, to retire in their mid-Sixties.\n\nGura: Mark, I wonder if you could situate this conversation in kind of a broader cultural sea change we're seeing. Bob Iger back at Disney in his 70s. That must in some way sort of liberate Tim Cook to look perhaps at a longer tenure at Apple.\n\nGurman: Yeah, that's a very good point. Certainly the next U. S. president is going to be in their 80s during their tenure. You have Pat Gelsinger, who's the CEO of Intel. He was named to that role three years ago when he was about 60. So certainly you do have some older statesmen there with Tim Cook, you know, one of the, the, the older ones and Apple appreciates, as some people tell me, the people with gray hair there, that means they have experience and wisdom, and they've been around the block a few times. There is nothing that Tim Cook hasn't seen, and wisdom goes a long way for being an Apple executive.\n\nGura: For his part, Cook has a lot of unfinished business he's attending to right now:\n\nApple's seen a slowdown in sales, the company is taking hits from regulators - in the US and the European Union, and after Apple's adventure in automobile manufacturing came to a screeching halt, it's under pressure to deliver something new.\n\nAll of that, and more, is on Cook's plate, and Mark says no one is pushing him to step aside.\n\nGurman: There's no mandatory retirement age. And I would say that even if there was, uh, they'd rip that up or shred it or light it on fire to let Cook stay around as long as he wants to. Because he's been effective, Wall Street loves him. The stock price has surely been positively reflected by Cook's tenure.\n\nAnd so I think Tim Cook is going to be the CEO of Apple as long as he wants to be the CEO of Apple and he won't step down a day before that.", "source": {"uri": "telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETTelecom.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Seventy percent of voters say the economy is either not so good (26 percent) or poor (44 percent).\n\nAt the same time, 61 percent of voters say their financial situation these days is either excellent (11 percent) or good (50 percent). Thirty-eight percent say it's either not so good (24 percent) or poor (14 percent).\n\nThere is a significant partisan divide in how people view the economy's state. Still, even among Democrats, few respondents have glowing perceptions of the national state of the economy.\n\nAmong Democrats, 55 percent say it's either excellent (7 percent) or good (48 percent), while 44 percent say it's either not so good (32 percent) or poor (12 percent).\n\nAmong Republicans, 7 percent say the economy is either excellent (1 percent) or good (6 percent), while 93 percent say it's either not so good (22 percent) or poor (71 percent).\n\nAmong Independents, 32 percent say the state of the economy is either excellent (5 percent) or good (27 percent), while 66 percent say it's either not so good (23 percent) or poor (43 percent).\n\nThe Biden administration has long dealt with the divide between what Americans perceive the overall state of the economy to be and what they report their own finances to be.

Some 57 percent said the cause was the high price of essential goods; 47 percent pointed to their lack of savings, and 46 percent to their lack of income. Meanwhile, 37 percent blamed their debt and 39 percent the performance of the U.S. economy. Some 36 percent said that the high cost of housing was causing them stress, while 33 percent pointed to high interest rates.\n\nDealing with such a stressful situation and the anxiety that this can trigger has led many Americans to avoid handling their finances entirely. Some 44 percent of respondents to the MarketWatch survey admitted that they will ignore a financial problem until it becomes a crisis. But avoidance and neglect can further corrode an individual's vulnerable financial situation.\n\nA significant percentage of respondents to the survey admitted to bad financial habits triggered by the stress they're experiencing. Some 58 percent said they do not use a detailed financial budget; 57 percent procrastinate on important financial decisions; 44 percent overspend to deal with stress; another 44 percent make purchases they cannot afford; and 41 percent avoid opening bills or reviewing card statements.\n\nAmericans are often alone experiencing these painful situations, with 58 percent telling MarketWatch that they hide their financial stress from loved ones.\n\nFollowing the pandemic, Americans were hit by a cost-of-living-crisis triggered by skyrocketing inflation, which in June 2022 reached a peak of 9.1 percent -- far from the Federal Reserve's goal of 2 percent.\n\nIn April, the latest data available, the consumer price index (CPI) was 3.4 percent higher than a year before and 0.3 percent higher than in March, but the overall increase was less than expected.\n\nBut while inflation has come down and appears to be continuing its downward trend, interest rates and mortgage rates remain high, keeping the cost of shelter up. Gasoline prices also shot up 2.8 percent in April, suggesting that drivers are suffering at the pump.\n\nThe price of food, on the other hand, has been declining, making groceries cheaper.\n\nEconomic problems remain high on the list of concerns troubling Americans ahead of the November presidential election.\n\nIn its latest survey, Gallup found that 36 percent of Americans thought that economic problems were the most important issue facing the country today, with 17 percent worrying about the state of the U.S. economy in general and 12 percent about the high cost of living.\n\nNoneconomic problems, including the government (21 percent) and immigration (18 percent), were considered the most important issues facing the country by around 75 percent of Americans in May.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "giulia_carbonaro@newsweek.com", "name": "Giulia Carbonaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarketWatch", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MarketWatch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gallup, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Burnout", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Burnout", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Stress", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Stress", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Education and Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2404365/americans-are-suffering-financial-burnout.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=dc21b09a093f6d3fa0f4a7c441f1c289", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Orders had declined over the last four months.\n\nNonetheless, the latest pace of decline was slower than the revised 0.8 percent fall posted in March.\n\nMoreover, when large-scale orders were excluded, new orders advanced 2.9 percent from the previous month.\n\n\"Together with the more positive sentiment indicators, this gives hope that the downward trend that has persisted for more than two years is coming to an end,\" Commerzbank economist Ralph Solveen said.\n\nThere was a sharp 15.4 percent decrease in orders for other transport equipment. The manufacture of computer, electronics and optical products reported a 5.1 percent fall and that of electrical equipment eased 4.1 percent.\n\nOn the other hand, orders in the automotive industry gained 4.1 percent.\n\nNew orders in the capital goods sector and the consumer goods sector moved up 0.5 percent and 0.7 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, there was a drop of 1.7 percent in the intermediate goods sector.\n\nForeign orders slid 0.1 percent as orders from the euro area declined 1.4 percent. By contrast, orders from the non-euro area grew 0.6 percent. Further, domestic orders registered a 0.3 percent drop.\n\nOn a yearly basis, the decline in new orders softened to 1.6 percent from 2.4 percent in March.\n\nData showed that real turnover in manufacturing decreased 0.9 percent on a monthly basis after a revised 0.4 percent drop in the prior month. Compared to last year, turnover was down 3.2 percent.\n\nDestatis is slated to release industrial production data on June 7. Production is expected to grow only 0.1 percent after a 0.4 percent drop in March.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerzbank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commerzbank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intermediate good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Books_and_Videos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Books and Videos", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Slings_and_Blowguns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Slings and Blowguns", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Living_History", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Living History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/forextopstory/2024/june/germanymanufacturing-jun06-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "textStart": 1775, "textEnd": 1781}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

This downturn in Germany's EV registration figures underscores a broader trend of diminishing consumer interest in electric vehicles, prompting automakers to reassess their long-term strategies.\n\nFor Germany in particular, EV sales have been hard hit by the sudden end of incentives at the end of 2023. The figures, released by KBA, Germany's federal motor transport authority, show an even greater drop in EV sales than the 14.1 percent recorded for Q1 2024.\n\nMore: Subaru BRZ And WRX Sales Have Tanked, But Forester Is On Fire\n\nOn the other hand, of the 236,425 new cars registered in Germany last month, petrol-powered registrations grew by 2.1 percent, with the largest share of 38 percent. Diesel was a close second, with 19 percent of the market and an increase of 3.2 percent. Hybrid sales stayed constant, while plug-in hybrids recorded a marginal increase in uptake of 1.7 percent.\n\nOverall sales of all vehicles in Germany declined by 4.3 percent in May 2024 compared to May 2023, although the year-to-date figures paint a better picture, with an increase of five percent. Peugeot recorded strong growth, with an increase of 70.9 percent in registrations compared to last year. China's MG also recorded an impressive performance, with registrations increasing by 51.6 percent.\n\nOn the home front, the results are mixed. Opel has been the strongest performer, with a growth of 29.3 percent, while Volkswagen, with 20.1 percent of the German market, grew deliveries by 8.7 percent. However, aside from Porsche, which managed to maintain sales figures equal to last year (-0.6 percent), the rest of the homegrown competition reported significant declines. That includes BMW, with 32.5 percent fewer registrations than last year, Mercedes, with 28.9 percent less, and Audi, with 17.7 percent fewer registrations.\n\nOverall, Tesla suffered the steepest decline of any brand in May, with sales plummeting 64% year-over-year. Year-to-date, their performance remains equally weak, with a 41.4% decrease.\n\nWhile SUVs remained the dominant body style, recording the most new registrations with a share of 29.3 percent, that's a 5.5 percent decline from last year.

Government deposits with conventional banks witnessed a decrease of 2.8 percent at OMR 5.2 billion, and deposits of public enterprises increased by 38.1 percent to OMR2.5 billion.\n\nThe nominal GDP, as per the preliminary data released by the NCSI, showed a decline of 2.8 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 over the same period of 2022. Despite the increase in the non-hydrocarbon sector by 1.7 percent, the contraction was driven by a decrease in output of the hydrocarbon sector by 11.9 percent.\n\nAs for the real gross domestic product (GDP), it demonstrates an increase of 1.3 percent during the same period under discussion. Similarly, this expansion was driven by 0.4 percent of the hydrocarbon sector and 2.4 percent of the non-hydrocarbon sector. The Omani oil average price at end of March 2024 at $79.7 per barrel was lower by 2.2 percent than that in March 2023. The average daily oil production at 998.7 thousand barrels as of March 2024 decreased by 6.1 percent. The Sultanate's average Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a year-on-year inflation of 0.03 percent as of March 2024.\n\nOther depository corporations (ODCs) consist of conventional and Islamic banks in Oman. Total outstanding credit extended by ODCs grew by 2.9 percent to OMR30.8 billion at the end of March 2024, with credit to the private sector demonstrating an increase of 3.6 percent year-on-year to reach OMR25.9 billion.\n\nNon-financial corporations received the highest share of the total private sector credit at approximately 45.4 percent at end-March 2024, followed by the household sector at 45.0 percent. The share of financial corporations was 5.8 percent while other sectors received the remaining 3.8 percent of total private sector credit as at end-March 2024.\n\nTotal deposits held with ODCs registered a year-on-year significant growth of 11.7 percent to reach OMR 30.3 billion at the end of March 2024. Total private sector deposits increased by 13.7 percent to OMR20.2 billion. In terms of sector-wise composition of private sector deposits, the biggest contribution is from household deposits at 49.8 percent, followed by non-financial corporations at 30.9 percent, financial corporations at 16.5 percent and other sectors at 2.8 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, the total assets of Islamic Banks and Windows increased by 14.8 percent on a year-n-year basis to OMR7.6 billion and constituted about 17.7 percent of the banking system's assets at end-March 2024. Islamic banking entities provided financing of OMR6.3 billion at the end of March 2024, recording a growth of 12 percent over that a year ago. Total deposits held with Islamic banks and windows increased by 18.6 percent to OMR 5.8 billion.\n\nAmong the indicators of monetary aggregates, broad money supply M2 at end-March 2024 increased by 15.2 percent to reach OMR24.2 billion. This is attributed to the increase in narrow money (M1) by 9.2 percent, along with 17.5 percent increase in quasi-money (Rial Omani saving and time deposits, certificates of deposit issued by banks, margin deposits and foreign currency denominated deposits). Looking at components of narrow money (M1) during the same period, currency with the public fell by 2.5 percent, while demand deposit increased by 12.4 percent.\n\nThe weighted average interest rate on OMR deposits with conventional banks witnessed an increase from 2.124 percent at end-March 2023 to 2.642 percent at end-March 2024, and the weighted average lending rate increased from 5.381 percent to 5.563 percent over the same period.\n\nMeanwhile, the overnight Rial Omani domestic interbank lending rate rose to 5.086 percent in March 2024 from 5.073 percent a year ago. This is an outcome of the increase in the average Repo rate for liquidity injection by the CBO to 6 percent from 5.323 percent a year ago, moving with the US Fderal Reserve.\n\n\u00a9 Muscat Media Group Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

The rate cut by Bank of Canada, as well as the lower-than-expected private payrolls data from the U.S. supported sentiment. Anxiety concerning the crucial non-farm payrolls data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday however lingered.\n\nThe ECB in its meeting on Thursday is widely expected to reduce the Deposit Facility Rate from 4 percent to 3.75 percent, Interest Rate on the main refinancing operations from 4.5 percent to 4.25 percent and the Marginal lending rate from 4.75 percent to 4.5 percent. Though the 25-basis points rate cut is factored in by the markets, considerable uncertainty remains on the rate cuts beyond June.\n\nWall Street had closed on a positive note on Wednesday, helped by gains in the technology space triggered by a tech rally in AI-darling Nvidia. Nasdaq Composite surged 1.95 percent to close at 17,186.38 whereas the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.25 percent to finish trading at 38,807.33.\n\nUpbeat sentiment prevailed in the European bourses on Wednesday ahead of the widely anticipated ECB decision.

The FTSE 100 Futures (Jun) has added 0.24 percent. The pan-European Stoxx 50 Futures (Jun) has rallied 0.50 percent. The SMI Futures (Jun) is flat. The DAX Futures (Jun) is however trading 0.02 percent lower.\n\nAmerican stock futures are trading directionless. The US 30 (DJIA) is trading 0.04 percent lower, whereas the US500 (S&P 500) is trading 0.04 percent above the flatline.\n\nAsian stock markets are trading on a positive note.

This survey was conducted between January 3 and January 17, 2024.\n\nIn the survey, 50 percent of Pakistanis demanded more steps from the government to prevent climate change, while 43 percent said the government's steps were sufficient and appreciated them while 7 percent refrained from giving any opinion on this question.\n\nOn the question if they want to work to prevent climate change, 42 percent refused to take any action on their own and 19 percent favoured recycling, 18 percent favoured abandoning vehicles and 7 percent favoured leaving meat consumption, 7 percent supported purchasing organic items, 7 percent supported leaving traveling by plane, and 6 percent supported preventing fast-changing fashion.\n\nThere is a great difference if Pakistanis are compared with the world public opinion. At global level, 64 percent named recycling as their first priority for tackling climate change while 29 percent termed avoiding fast-changing fashion and 22 percent purchasing organic items their third priority. As many as 18 percent said not to use a car and 17 percent supported not to travel by plane, while 12 percent supported giving up consumption of meat.", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistanis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistanis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_farming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Organic farming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate_Change", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Climate Change", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleogeography_and_Paleoclimatology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleogeography and Paleoclimatology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Internet", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational_Change", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Organizational Change", "wgt": 14}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/akhbar/2024-06-06/l_1197416_051647_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Islamabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-03", "textStart": 336, "textEnd": 345}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-01-", "textStart": 350, "textEnd": 360}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

This was down from last month's initial forecast of 0.3 percent.\n\nThe final estimate was down from the 3.5 percent growth in worker productivity reported in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAccording to the federal agency, the final estimate showed an annualized increase of 4 percent in unit labor costs, adjusted downward from the first 4.7 percent reading.\n\nBy comparison, unit labor costs were up 0.9 percent from a year earlier, the slowest growth in three years. Additionally, they were down 2.8 percent in the final three months of 2023, a revision from the initial 0 percent.\n\nFor the two quarters, the Labor Department revised various numbers across the board, with wage growth figures capturing most of the attention.\n\nReal (inflation-adjusted) hourly compensation was revised from 1.1 percent to 0.4 percent in the first quarter. In the manufacturing sector, real wage growth was adjusted lower from negative 0.4 percent to negative 0.6 percent.\n\nIn the October to December period, the gains in real hourly compensation were wiped out, shifting from 0.8 percent growth to negative 2 percent.\n\nInitial applications for unemployment benefits swelled by 8,000 to 229,000 for the week ending June 1, higher than the consensus estimate of 220,000.\n\nContinuing jobless claims inched higher to 1.792 million, while the four-week average, which strips the week-to-week volatility, dipped to 222,250.\n\nHiring announcements reached a decade low of 4,326, the firm noted.\n\nYear-to-date, employers have announced 385,859 layoffs, down 7.6 percent from the same span a year ago.\n\n\"Job cuts remained flat in May as companies assess performance and make plans for Q3 and Q4. Meanwhile, hiring announcements are at their lowest levels in a decade.

As such, consumer spending, while not grinding to a halt, is expected to continue losing some momentum as the year progresses.\"\n\nPersonal income eased to 0.3 percent in April, down from 0.5 percent in March. Real personal disposable income, accounting for inflation and taxes, slipped 0.1 percent.\n\nFirst-quarter consumer spending was adjusted down in the Bureau of Economic Analysis' second GDP estimate.\n\nA slowdown in economic conditions could be the good news the Federal Reserve has been searching for in the current tightening cycle.\n\nHowever, the next step toward cutting interest rates may depend on next week's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.\n\nProgress on inflation has slowed this year, with the annual inflation rate sitting above 3 percent.\n\nCore CPI, which omits the volatile energy and food sectors, is also projected to remain flat at 3.6 percent.\n\nFed officials have repeatedly expressed that they will wait for further inflation data to be convinced they are closer to achieving the 2 percent target.\n\nHowever, considering that the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank pulled the trigger on a quarter-point rate cut before touching this level, there could be speculation that the Federal Reserve could follow suit.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

So, with the spending plan in check, with consumption slowing down but still robust, with investments cooling but not really falling off a cliff, quarter-on-quarter growth should be a little less than potential, but year-on-year growth should be above six percent,\" Dacanay said.\n\nThe economy posted a slower GDP print in the second quarter last year as government underspending dragged economic activity. The Philippines has since bounced back with a faster growth in the first quarter.\n\nHousehold consumption also grew by 4.7 percent in the first quarter, marking the slowest growth rate in private consumption since 2010.\n\nThe recently approved tariff reduction on rice could add 1.4 percentage points to growth this year under the best-case scenario and depending on the timing of implementation.\n\n\"Cutting the tariff rate of rice by 20 percentage points could unlock around two percent of household budgets to be spent on other things, more so for low-income households who spend a larger proportion of their budgets on rice,\" Dacanay said.\n\n\"With household consumption representing 70 percent of the economy, unleashing two percent of household income will help support household consumption and, consequently, boost overall growth,\" he said.\n\nPresident Marcos has lowered the tariff for imported rice, for both in- and out-quota rates, to 15 percent from 35 percent until 2028 to bring down the price of rice to P29 per kilo for the poorest consumers.\n\nThe tariff rate cut also poses downside risks to the inflation outlook, Dacanay said.\n\n\"Let's say the rice tariff rate cut happens tomorrow or happens within June. I do think that's a big downside risk to the inflation outlook, and perhaps inflation will not breach the four percent target in the second quarter,\" he said.\n\nIf fully implemented, the economist said the tariff cuts could ease inflation by as much as 1.8 percentage points this year.\n\nHowever, the economist said they have not included the tariff rate cuts to their official growth and inflation forecasts this year.\n\nHSBC expects the Philippine economy to grow by 5.8 percent this year and 6.1 percent in 2025.

A 4.9 percent fall in food sales caused the overall lower demand.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_National_Institute_of_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian National Institute of Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Salesmanship", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Salesmanship", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Brokers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Brokers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Education and Training", "wgt": 13}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/images/v4/RTTNews-logo-512x512.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

If the conviction really mattered, and this isn't to say it won't when it matters, Biden's support would likely go up considerably, while Trump's would drop considerably. That isn't necessarily the case, though.\n\nOn Wednesday, the latest edition of The Economist/YouGov poll was released, showing Trump and Biden tied at 42 percent each. In last week's poll, Trump led Biden with 41-40 percent, so each of them saw a small bump, even the candidate who Democrats are obsessed with labeling as a \"convicted felon.\" Independents also prefer Trump over Biden, 39-29 percent, and Biden only enjoys a slight edge in hanging onto support from fellow Democrats in contrast to Trump's support from fellow Republicans, at 89 percent and 88 percent, respectively.\n\nThese polls are released every week, and they have shown a slight lead by Trump, or Trump and Biden tied.\n\nThat Biden and Trump are tied is not the only issue for the incumbent president desperately running for reelection. Trump supporters are also far more eager about voting for their candidate than Biden supporters are. While 66 percent of Trump supporters say they're \"extremely enthusiastic\" (47 percent) or \"very enthusiastic\" (19 percent), just 53 percent of his supporters said they were \"extremely enthusiastic\" (36 percent) or \"very enthusiastic.\"\n\nFurther, while just 4 percent of Trump supporters say they're \"not at all enthusiastic\" to vote for him, 11 percent said the same about Biden.\n\nThe enthusiasm numbers looked to have dropped for both Trump and Biden from the last poll, but it was a matter of a margin of error for Trump--from 68 percent--as opposed to a steeper decline for Biden, who had 59 percent of his supporters saying they were \"extremely enthusiastic\" (38 percent) or \"very enthusiastic\" (21 percent).\n\nBiden's approval numbers and other similar findings continue to look bad for the president as well. Sixty-percent of voters believe that the country is headed \"off in the wrong direction,\" though 50 percent of Biden's supporters believe they're \"generally headed in the right direction.\" Fifty-eight percent of registered voters also disapprove of the way Biden is handling his job as president, with 47 percent saying they do so \"strongly.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the most important issues, Biden doesn't fare well there, either. Nearly a quarter of voters, at 24 percent, say \"inflation/prices\" is their most important issue, while coming in at a distant second is \"immigration,\" at 12 percent. Those happen to be Biden's worst issues, as 60 percent disapprove of his handling of inflation/prices while just 31 percent approve, and 59 percent disapprove of his handling of immigration while just 31 percent approve as well.\n\nThe poll delved even further into the economy as well, bringing even more still bad news for Biden. Over a majority of voters, at 53 percent, believe the economy is \"getting worse,\" and a plurality of voters, at 43 percent, say they're \"worse off financially\" from a year ago. Just 15 percent say they're \"better off.\" Even Biden supporters are not likely to say they're \"better off\" from a year ago, with just 27 percent saying so, and a plurality of such respondents even believe the economy is \"getting better,\" with 47 percent believing so.\n\nAmericans are hurting on the economy, and the Democratically-allied media doesn't seem to care. As a particular example, Axios came under fire for a post claiming \"the economy is in good shape.\"\n\nOn immigration, it's no wonder that this week, just about five months exactly before Election Day, Biden finally announced he was taking executive action on immigration to do something about the crisis at the southern border, though it's questionable if this will give him any kind of a boost. Many of Biden's fellow Democrats oppose it for being supposedly too anti-immigrant, and Republicans see it for being too little too late, especially since Biden and most Congressional Democrats oppose HR 2, the Secure the Border Act, which the House passed over a year ago.\n\nThe poll also delved further into the Trump \"trial,\" and this time respondents look to be willing to scrutinize the process a lot more than they did in say the CBS News poll, which we covered on Monday.\n\nA plurality of voters, at 43 percent, believe Trump is treated \"more harshly than other people\" by the criminal justice system, though 81 percent of voters believe he should be treated \"equally to other people,\" with even 78 percent of Biden supporters saying so. In this poll, voters are more evenly split as to if Trump received \"a fair trial in New York,\" with 47 percent saying he did not, and 46 percent saying he did.\n\nMajorities of voters or close to majorities still do approve of the verdict (51-42 percent), believe the trial was conducted fairly (49-42 percent) and believe DA Alvin Bragg was right to bring the hush money charges (48-41 percent). It does not appear that respondents were told that Bragg charged Trump with felonies in the case when he could have brought the charges as misdemeanors, was using an untested legal theory, and after the statute of limitations had expired. Prosecutors had also previously declined to bring charges.\n\nAnd yet while such findings may not be the best news for Trump, he's still tied with Biden, which is certainly bad news for the incumbent. Ninety-two percent of voters also say they're not reconsidering their vote after such a verdict, perhaps the biggest number we've seen on this question. A plurality of voters, at 25 percent, also believe it will have \"no effect\" on Trump's changes.\n\nWhile a plurality of Biden supporters, at 33 percent, believe Trump's conviction will have a \"somewhat negative\" effect on his chances, a plurality of Trump supporters, at 34 percent, believe it will have a \"very positive\" effect. That shows us not only that partisans see the trial outcome for how they want to, but also that Trump's supporters may be more willing to use this as an excuse to rally behind Trump. It also goes back to that enthusiasm factor mentioned above.\n\nThe poll was conducted June 2-4, with 1,766 respondents including 1,566 registered voters for whom there was a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.\n\nThis poll from The Economist/YouGov does not look to be an outlier. As we covered in that same Monday's VIP piece about polls, Trump and Biden are also tied at 41 percent each in the I&I/TIPP poll, which is actually an improvement for Trump, since Biden enjoyed 42 percent to Trump's 40 percent last month.\n\nAnd, even better than a tie is that Trump is leading Biden by 44-43 percent in the new Morning Consult poll among 10,404 registered voters. They also frequently put out polls, which have shown it to be something of a close and competitive race.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axios_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axios (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margin_of_error", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margin of error"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_to_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opposition to immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_limitations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute of limitations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisprudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisprudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Consult", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morning Consult"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription Services", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/152/941d93e0-9320-4144-b361-20d10436ed59.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "dateEnd": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 6354, "textEnd": 6362}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Around 50 percent seem to be unfamiliar and 27 percent are unsure of their view, as per a news release. This study was conducted online between 27 and 31 May 2024, with a national sample of 1,042 Singaporeans, using a questionnaire designed by YouGov.\n\nEven though awareness is low, worry around contracting the virus is high. Two-thirds (66 percent) of Singaporeans say they are very or somewhat concerned about contracting the new covid variant, and only a third (34 percent) are not concerned about it.\n\nIt is interesting to note that worry is higher among those who are vaccinated with at least two shots (67 percent) as compared to those who are partially vaccinated (50 percent) or not vaccinated (55 percent).\n\nAmong a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, Singapore's Health Ministry has advised residents to wear masks again. YouGov data shows that a majority (55 percent) are taking this precaution and claim they wear masks when in public. However, maintaining personal hygiene like washing hands regularly, using sanitizer, etc. is the most followed precautionary measure, with 64 percent residents saying they take this form of precaution.\n\nAvoiding crowded areas is the next common measure (51 percent), followed by social distancing (33 percent), working from home instead of office (14 percent) and avoiding public transport (12 percent). Only one in eight Singaporeans (12 percent) claim they do not take any precautions, with GenZ forming the largest proportion (at 22 percent) of respondents saying this.\n\nThe data shows that upon contracting the virus, Singaporeans are most likely to isolate or stay at home from grocery stores, restaurants and retail stores if they had visible symptoms than if they did not have any symptoms.\n\nWhen it comes to friends or family houses, Singaporeans are equally divided. Around 37 percent said they would isolate if they had covid with symptoms and another 37 percent said they would do so even if they did not have any symptoms.\n\nThe sentiment is similar when it comes to isolating themselves from work, with an equal number of respondents saying they would stay at home if they had or did not have visible symptoms of Covid.\n\nWhen asked if they would take an additional vaccination if available to combat new variants of COVID-19, a majority of Singaporeans (52 percent) said they are very or somewhat likely to take the vaccine. Men are significantly more likely than women to say this (56 percent men vs 47 percent women).\n\nAround 38 percent are hesitant and would not be open to taking another shot and one in 10 (10 percent) are not sure.\n\nThose who are vaccinated with at least two shots are more likely to go for an additional shot (with 53 percent saying this) as compared to those who are vaccinated with one shot (34 percent) or not vaccinated at all (10 percent).", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_distancing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social distancing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_(New_Zealand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health (New Zealand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hand washing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hygiene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Issues", "wgt": 5}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Disease Control and Prevention", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Prescription Services", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2024-06/f6b6de47-a5f4-41f5-b447-c67f69cbbaea/Covid_Vaccine_Rep_Unsplash_jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Mapa told BusinessMirror on Wednesday.\n\nBased on the data, inflation for housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels increased 0.9 percent while transportation posted a 3.5- percent increase in May 2024.\n\nUnder housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, the highest increase was for Water Supply and Miscellaneous Services Relating to the Dwelling which grew 7.4 percent; followed by Maintenance, Repair and Security of the Dwelling which increased 2.9 percent.\n\nFor transportation, Operation of Personal Transport Equipment posted a growth of 5.3 percent in May 2024, followed by Passenger Transport Services which grew 3.2 percent during the period.\n\nThe increase in the price of these non-food items, HSBC Asean economist Aris Dacanay said, indicates that not only are Filipino's priorities changing, but also that their standards of living are improving.\n\nDacanay noted that currently, food and non-alcoholic beverages account for 37.745 percent of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). This is expected to change as the country moves closer to becoming an Upper Middle Income Country (UMIC).\n\nHe said the share of food and non-alcoholic beverages in the CPI of UMICs in the region tend to be lower at around 20 percent. This means the country, which is on track to hitting UMIC status, would see a gradual reduction in the share of food in the CPI.\n\n\"I think...in terms of the CPI basket, the Philippines has one of the highest shares in terms of raw food. If I remember correctly, the weight is 30 [percent]. For other upper-middle income economies, I think it ranges around 20 [percent], just a rough number. So it does [reflect a country's path of moving to a higher-income status]. We are transitioning to that trend,\" Dacanay said.\n\nInflation path\n\nTHE Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) said the year-to-date average of 3.5 percent was within the Government's inflation target range of 3.0 percent \u00b1 1.0 percentage point for the year.\n\nOn a month-on-month seasonally adjusted basis, BSP said the headline inflation rose to 0.3 percent in May from 0.2 percent in the previous month.\n\nCore inflation, meanwhile, which excludes selected volatile food and energy items and measures underlying demand-side price pressures, eased further to 3.1 percent year-on-year in May from 3.2 percent in April.\n\n\"The latest inflation outturn is consistent with the BSP's projections that inflation is likely to exceed the target range temporarily due to the possible impact of adverse weather conditions on domestic agricultural output as well as positive base effects,\" BSP said.\n\nFor its part, the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) said it is stepping up efforts against inflation drivers following the rise in the country's headline inflation rate in May 2024.\n\n\"The government will continue to implement lasting policy reforms to ensure we address the drivers of food and non-food inflation sustainably. We want to maintain a macroeconomic environment conducive to investment and high-quality job creation -- an environment that would allow us to hit the Marcos Administration's development targets by 2028,\" Neda Secretary Arsenio M. Balisacan said.\n\nFood inflation\n\nMEANWHILE, Neda said food inflation decelerated but is still elevated at 6.1 percent in May from 6.3 percent in April.\n\nThe slowdown of food inflation for the month was traced primarily to the slower increase in the prices of vegetables, tubers, plantains, and cooking bananas -- to 2.7 percent in May from 4.3 percent in April.\n\nAlthough still elevated, rice inflation decreased slightly to 23.0 percent for the month from 23.9 percent in April. The May inflation report recorded a zero percent inflation rate for fish and other seafood from 0.4 percent the previous year.\n\n\"To help manage food inflation, promote policy stability and investment planning, and enhance food security, the Neda Board has agreed to reduce the rice duty rate to 15 percent from 35 percent for both in-quota and out-quota imports until 2028,\" the country's chief economic planner said.\n\nBalisacan said the Neda Board also approved the extension until 2028 of the reduced tariff rates on corn, pork, and mechanically deboned meat under Executive Order No. 50, s. 2023.\n\n\"The Neda Board approved the new Comprehensive Tariff Program for 2024-2028, a strategic move to ensure access and affordability to essential commodities while balancing the interests of consumers, local producers, and the economy. At the same time, we recognize the need to help our farmers by modernizing our agricultural sector,\" he said.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of elevated food prices on the poor and vulnerable sector, Neda said the Department of Social Welfare and Development and relevant agencies are set to implement the Food Stamp Program nationwide in July fully.\n\nThis program expects to cover 1 million households by 2027 from the initial 300,000 families in 10 regions.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cai_u_ordinario@businessmirror.com.ph", "name": "Cai U.

The economy, meanwhile, is faring better than expected: the Bank raised its growth outlook for this year in an updated set of forecasts released at the same time.\n\nAs such, the rate cut -- which has been widely anticipated for three months -- is likely to offer only limited relief to governments, companies and consumers.\n\n\"Since the Governing Council meeting in September 2023, inflation has fallen by more than 2.5 percentage points and the inflation outlook has improved markedly,\" the ECB said in a statement. \"It is now appropriate to moderate the degree of monetary policy restriction after nine months of holding rates steady.\"\n\n\"At the same time,\" it warned, \"despite the progress over recent quarters, domestic price pressures remain strong as wage growth is elevated, and inflation is likely to stay above target well into next year. \"\n\nThe Bank said it's \"determined\" to bring inflation down to its medium-term target of 2 percent in a \"timely manner\" but stressed that \"the Governing Council is not pre-committing to a particular rate path.\"\n\nThe ECB's most aggressive tightening cycle since the launch of the single currency 25 years ago has helped to bring down inflation from a peak above 10 percent in 2022 to below 3 percent as of May. However, progress has stalled most recently, with both headline inflation and wage growth accelerating more than expected.\n\nThis has raised question marks over how fast and how much further the Bank can ease policy later this year. Financial markets, which started the year expecting six rate cuts, now don't even expect three.\n\nThe ECB's new forecasts reflect stronger-than-previously-expected price pressures in the near term but continue to show inflation settling below 2 percent over the medium term.\n\nInflation is now seen averaging percent in 2.5 percent 2024 and 2.2 percent in 2025, compared to forecasts of 2.3 percent and 2.0 percent, respectively, in March.

But it shaved its 2025 forecast to 1.4 percent from 1.5 percent and left its 2026 forecast unchanged at 1.6 percent.\n\nFinancial markets reacted with some disappointment to the news, having hoped for a clearer hint that today's move would represent the first of a series of rate cuts.

His lead over President Biden has shrunk in that time, tightening from 3 points to 1 point in the most recent poll, statistically tied.\n\nA plurality of 40 percent said Trump's convictions had no impact on their decision for who to vote for in November. A third said they make them less likely to support Trump, while 27 percent said they make them more likely to support him.\n\nThe Manhattan jury handed down a historic verdict last week in Trump's hush-money trial, finding him guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The verdict made Trump the first former president to be convicted of a crime.\n\nTrump has continued to assert he has committed no wrongdoing and signaled he is likely to appeal the verdict.\n\nThe poll found a split in views of the verdict falling on ideological lines. A majority of Democrats said the verdict makes them less likely to support Trump, while most Republicans said it makes them more likely to back him.\n\nIndependents were more divided, with 41 percent saying it has no impact on their vote, 38 percent saying it makes them less likely to vote for Trump and 21 percent saying it makes them more likely.\n\nWith the key voter bloc of those who said they are undecided between Biden and Trump, 58 percent said the verdict has no impact on their vote. But 36 percent said they are less likely to support him, and only 6 percent said they are more likely.\n\nPollsters found 40 percent of respondents, including 67 percent of Democrats and 42 percent of independents, said Trump should serve prison time for his sentence, while 25 percent, including 46 percent of Republicans and 22 percent of independents, said he should pay a fine.

Higher-yielding stopover visitors, who typically spend 28 times' more in-country than their cruise counterparts, were said to have \"held steady\" at 700,000 arrivals for the period.\n\n\"Initial data revealed that the tourism sector continued to register healthy gains during the review month. This reflected expected expenditure paced strength in the high-value added air segment and expanded volume in the sea component, due to sustained demand for travel in key source markets and ongoing marketing efforts,\" the Central Bank said.\n\n\"Official figures provided by the Ministry of Tourism indicated that total visitor arrivals rose to 910,000 in April compared to 870,000 a year earlier. The dominant sea segment firmed to 750,000 visitors from 690,000 passengers in the comparative 2023 period. However, the high value-added air component edged down to 160,000 visitors from 170,000 in the prior year.\n\n\"A disaggregation by major port of entry showed that total arrivals to New Providence expanded by 10.4 percent to 400,000 visitors. Underlying this development, sea passengers grew by 18.5 percent to 300,000. However, air traffic declined by 7 percent to 100,000 from a year earlier,\" the regulator continued.\n\n\"Further, total arrivals to Grand Bahama rose by 1.5 percent to 47,108 relative to the previous year. Contributing to this outturn, arrivals by sea grew by 2.3 percent to 42,015 compared to 2023. Conversely, air traffic decline by 4.4 percent to 5,093 vis- a\u0300-vis the same period last year.\n\n\"Providing some offset, total arrivals to the Family Islands decreased slightly by 0.4 percent to 400,000 vis-a\u0300- vis the preceding year as sea and air passengers measured 377,190 and 33,931 respectively.\"\n\nAssessing tourism's strength for the first four months of 2024, the Central Bank added: \"On a year-to-date basis, total arrivals strengthened by 12.4 percent to 3.9m visitors relative to the comparable 2023 period. Sea arrivals rose by 14.4 percent to 3.3m while air traffic held steady at 700,000.\n\n\"The most recent statistics provided by the Nassau Airport Development Company (NAD) indicated that total departures in April - net of domestic passengers - also decreased by 0.3 percent to 151,591 vis-a\u0300- vis the comparable 2023 period.\n\n\"Specifically, non-US departures declined by 9.8 percent to 20,026. However, US departures grew marginally by 1.3 percent to 131,565. On a year-to-date basis, total outbound traffic advanced by 8 percent to 596,086 on account of a rise in both US departures by 9 percent to 509,279, and non-US departures by 2.1 percent to 86,807,\" the regulator said.\n\n\"In the short-term vacation rental market, data provided by AirDNA showed that in April total room nights sold declined by 5.5 percent to 53,588 when compared to the same period last year. Correspondingly, the occupancy rate for entire place listings reduced to 47.9 percent from 56.4 percent a year earlier, while the occupancy rate for hotel comparable listings decreased to 45.8 percent from 53.5 percent in 2023.\n\n\"Meanwhile, price indicators revealed that the average daily room rate (ADR) for both entire place and hotel comparable listings moved higher by 3.8 percent and by 5.5 percent to $692.54 and $197.02, respectively.\"\n\nThe Central Bank added that average consumer price inflation, a measured by the All Bahamas Retail Price Index, was slashed by more than half for February 2024 as it came in at 2.5 percent compared to the prior year's 5.8 percent.\n\nIt also left its economic outlook largely unchanged from that of previous months. \"The domestic economy is expected to expand at a moderated pace in 2024, bolstered by ongoing gains in the tourism industry and other areas of the real sector,\" the Central Bank said.\n\n\"In addition, new and ongoing foreign investment projects are anticipated to provide support to the construction sector and aid economic growth. However, downside risks to tourism remain, predominantly related to exogenous factors such as geopolitical tensions and heightened global oil prices, which could disrupt travel sector activity....\n\n\"With regard to the labour market, employment conditions are expected to continue to improve with additional job gains primarily in the construction and tourism sectors. In terms of prices, inflation is projected to maintain its downward trajectory, as global oil prices taper off\" even though global oil price uncertainty, supply chain shocks and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East remain risks.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the environment should encourage a rise in lending to the private sector. Further, external reserves are forecasted to remain robust for the rest of year, although a modest reduction is likely, given the anticipated growth in domestic credit,\" the Central Bank said.\n\n\"Nonetheless, external balances should remain more than sufficient to maintain the Bahamian dollar currency peg, while foreign exchange market conditions are projected to stay at healthy levels supported by tourism inflows and other private sector activities.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune242.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tribune242"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aggregate demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cruise ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bahama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Bahama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Bahama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau,_Bahamas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nassau, Bahamas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nassau, Bahamas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Providence", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Providence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Providence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "The Bahamas"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed exchange rate system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahamian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bahamian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_direct_investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign direct investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air_Quality", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Air Quality", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality/Travel", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration_and_Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Emigration and Immigration", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

The drop-off marked the 11th in the last 12 quarters, to the lowest level since 2000.\n\nThe latest decline left total residential lending activity down 4.8 percent from a year earlier and 69.3 percent from a high point hit in 2021. It came amid another period of rising mortgage interest rates and elevated home prices unaffordable to significant portions of American households, on top of low supplies of homes for sale.\n\nOngoing decreases in lending activity during the first quarter resulted from losses in all major categories of residential lending. Purchase-loan activity went down another 9.9 percent quarterly, to about 565,000, while refinance deals dipped downward by 1.9 percent, to 491,000. Home-equity credit lines slipped 9 percent, to 222,000.\n\nMeasured monetarily, lenders issued $405.6 billion worth of residential mortgages in the first quarter of 2024. That was down 4.8 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 and 4.5 percent from the first quarter of last year.\n\nThe varying paces of change among different loan types helped reduce the portion of all residential mortgages represented by purchase lending for the third straight quarter while pushing the refinance component upward. Still, purchase loans were the most common form of mortgages around the U.S. in early 2024, comprising more than 40 percent, followed by refinance packages and home-equity lending.\n\n\"There is reason to hope that we will see something of a turnaround when second-quarter data comes in, given the jump in lending activity that happened during the peak home-buying season of 2023,\" said Rob Barber, CEO at ATTOM. \"But with little sign that interest rates are coming down, which could fire up refinance and HELOC lending, or that supplies of homes for sale are going up, any increase is likely to be limited.\"\n\nHome-mortgage lending took another hit in the early months of 2024 as average interest rates for 30-year fixed loans rose close to 7 percent (it has since increased). That continued to push up home ownership costs at a time when near-record home prices in most of the country already were unaffordable, or a significant financial stretch, for average wage earners. Purchase lending was further eroded amid counts of homes for sale that were less than half the levels seen five years ago.\n\nTotal lending activity down in two-thirds of nation\n\nBanks and other lenders issued a total of 1,277,899 residential mortgages in the first quarter of 2024, down from 1,371,344 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fallback continued a three-year run of declines that was broken only by a spike in the second quarter of last year.\n\nThe latest total also was down annually from 1,343,010 in the first quarter of 2023, and from a recent high point of 4,165,204 hit in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nA total of $405.6 billion was lent to homeowners and buyers in the first quarter of this year, which was down from $426.1 billion in the prior quarter and down from $424.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023. The latest figure stood at less than one-third of the recent peak of $1.29 trillion hit in 2021.\n\nOverall lending activity dipped lower from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year in 125, or 69 percent, of the 182 metropolitan statistical areas around the U.S. that had a population of 200,000 or more and at least 1,000 total residential mortgages issued in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nTotal lending also remained down from the first quarter of 2023 in 118, or 65 percent, of the metro areas analyzed. It was off by at least 5 percent annually in almost half of those markets.\n\nThe largest quarterly decreases were in St. Louis, MO (total lending down 40.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024); Buffalo, NY (down 29.9 percent); Albany, NY (down 28.6 percent); Syracuse, NY (down 27.4 percent) and Pensacola, FL (down 25.6 percent).\n\nAside from St. Louis and Buffalo, metro areas with a population of least 1 million that had the biggest decreases in total loans from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 were Minneapolis, MN (down 21.2 percent); Hartford, CT (down 18.2 percent) and Honolulu, HI (down 16.3 percent).\n\nThe biggest quarterly increases among metro areas with a population of at least 1 million came in Tucson, AZ (total lending up 15.2 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024); Phoenix, AZ (up 14.9 percent); Birmingham, AL (up 8.8 percent); Virginia Beach, VA (up 8.6 percent) and Memphis, TN (up 8.3 percent).\n\nPurchase mortgages slump throughout U.S. but remain top loan type\n\nLoans issued to home buyers fell back in the first few months of 2024 for the third straight quarter after a surge of about 25 percent in the Spring of last year.\n\nThe latest total of 564,598 dropped from 626,759 in the fourth quarter of 2023. It was also down 12.3 percent from 643,988 a year earlier and almost two-thirds from a high point of 1,516,377 hit in the Spring of 2021.\n\nThe $214.8 billion dollar volume of purchase loans in the first quarter of 2024 was down 6.7 percent from $230.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 7.8 percent from $233.1 billion in the first quarter of last year.\n\nResidential purchase-mortgage originations decreased quarterly in 132 of the 182 metro areas in the report (73 percent) and annually in 77 percent of those markets.\n\nThe largest quarterly decreases were in Wichita, KS (purchase loans down 66.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024); Mobile AL (down 54.2 percent); St. Louis, MO (down 45.3 percent); Manchester, NH (down 39 percent) and Buffalo, NY (down 38.3 percent).\n\nAside from St. Louis and Buffalo, the biggest quarterly decreases in metro areas with a population of at least 1 million in the first quarter of 2024 came in Boston, MA (down 27.6 percent); Minneapolis, MN (down 24.8 percent) and Milwaukee, WI (down 24.5 percent).\n\nThe top increases in purchase lending from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 in metro areas with a population of at least 1 million were in Phoenix, AZ (up 23.6 percent); Tucson, AZ (up 23.6 percent); Orlando, FL (up 18.6 percent); Las Vegas, NV (up 18 percent) and Tampa, FL (up 13.2 percent).\n\nRefinance mortgages still up year over year but remain far beneath peak\n\nLenders issued 490,953 residential refinance mortgages in the first quarter of 2024. That was down from 500,323 in the fourth quarter of 2023, although still up 11.4 percent from 440,890 a year earlier because of a short-lived jump in 2023.\n\nNevertheless, the latest figure remained down 82.1 percent from a peak of 2,742,371 in early 2021 when mortgage rates below 3 percent sent refinance deals soaring.\n\nThe $149.6 billion dollar volume of refinance packages in the first quarter of 2024 was down 1.2 percent from $151.4 billion in the prior quarter, but still 4.7 percent higher than $142.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRefinancing activity went down quarterly in 83, or 46 percent, of the 182 metro areas around the U.S. with enough data to analyze. It was up annually in 149, or 82 percent, of those metros.\n\nThe largest quarterly decreases were in St. Louis, MO (refinance loans down 35 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024); Green Bay, WI (down 30.1 percent); Madison, WI (down 26.9 percent); Honolulu, HI (down 25.5 percent) and Scranton, PA (down 23.9 percent).\n\nAside from St. Louis and Honolulu, metro areas with a population of least 1 million where refinance activity decreased most quarterly were Atlanta, GA (down 19.6 percent); Buffalo, NY (down 18.9 percent) and Minneapolis, MN (down 14.7 percent).\n\nMetro areas with a population of least 1 million and the largest increases in the number of refinance loans from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 were Virginia Beach, VA (up 26.7 percent); Memphis, TN (up 26.5 percent); Birmingham, AL (up 23.5 percent); San Jose, CA (up 21.6 percent) and Seattle, WA (up 18.3 percent).\n\nHELOC lending slips again, down in three-quarters of metro markets\n\nHome-equity lines of credit (HELOCs) also decreased in the first quarter of 2024, declining to 222,348 from 244,262 in the fourth quarter of 2023. The latest count was down 13.9 percent from 258,132 a year earlier. The first-quarter decrease marked the third in a row after a brief gain last Spring.\n\nThe $41.1 billion volume of HELOC loans in the first quarter of 2024 was down from $44.5 billion in the prior three-month period, a 7.6 percent decline. The latest total also was down annually, by 15.5 percent.\n\nHELOCs comprised 17.4 percent of all loans in the most recent quarter. That was down from 19.2 percent in the first quarter of 2023 but still almost four times the level recorded in the early part of 2021.\n\nHELOC mortgage originations decreased from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024 in 75 percent of the metro areas analyzed. The largest quarterly decreases in metro areas with a population of at least 1 million were in St. Louis, MO (down 37.4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024); Kansas City, MO (down 27.6 percent); Buffalo, NY (down 27.3 percent); Indianapolis, IN (down 24 percent) and Fresno, CA (down 22.6 percent).\n\nThe largest quarterly increases in HELOC activity in metro areas with a population of at least 1 million and sufficient data to analyze came in Columbus, OH (up 8.5 percent); Baltimore, MD (up 5.1 percent); New York, NY (up 3.4 percent); New Orleans, LA (up 1.7 percent) and Washington, DC (up 0.8 percent).\n\nFHA and VA loan percentages rise\n\nMortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) rose early this year as a percentage of all lending. They accounted for 210,246, or 16.5 percent, of all residential property loans originated in the first quarter of 2024. That was up from 15.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 and 12.9 percent in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nResidential loans backed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) totaled 68,430, or 5.4 percent, of all residential property loans originated in the first quarter of 2024. That was up from 4.3 percent in the previous quarter, although down slightly from 5.5 percent a year earlier.\n\nTypical purchase loan goes up while down payments decline, both by unusually large amounts\n\nAs the national median home price increased in the first quarter of 2024, the typical single-family home loan also rose. But the opposite was true for median down-payment percentages.\n\nAmong homes purchased with financing in the first quarter of 2024, the median loan amount climbed to $329,800. That was up 7.4 percent from $307,000 in the prior quarter and 7.2 percent from $307,722 a year earlier. The quarterly increase was the largest since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nHowever, the median down payment of $26,700 on single-family homes purchased with financing in the first quarter of 2024 dropped by 20.9 percent, from $33,750 in the fourth quarter of 2023. For the year, it was down 3.1.\n\nReport methodology\n\nATTOM analyzed recorded mortgage and deed of trust data for single-family homes, condos, town homes and multi-family properties of two to four units for this report. Each recorded mortgage or deed of trust was counted as a separate loan origination. Dollar volume was calculated by multiplying the total number of loan originations by the average loan amount for those loan originations.\n\nAbout ATTOM\n\nATTOM provides premium property data to power products that improve transparency, innovation, efficiency, and disruption in a data-driven economy.

For those companies not defined as publicly traded according to the Income Tax Act, I propose to set the rate at 25 percent instead of 27.50 percent on certain conditions,\" the finance minister said.\n\nPreviously, though the tax rate was set at 27.50 percent, it would rise to 30 percent if companies failed to meet the necessary conditions.\n\n\"To make the economy more formal and promote sole proprietor companies, I propose to change the sole proprietor company tax rate from 22.50 percent to 20 percent on conditions, just like that of non-listed companies,\" he said.\n\nThe tax rate was previously 22.50 percent, but it would rise to 25 percent if companies failed to meet the conditions.\n\nThe minister also proposed that if more than 10 percent of paid-up capital shares were sold through IPO, a listed company would get to pay a tax rate of 20 percent instead of the existing 22.50 percent under the same conditions.\n\nHowever, he proposed to lower the tax rate from 25 percent to 22.50 percent for publicly traded companies with 10 percent or less of paid capital shares on the market through IPOs.\n\nThe proposed budget kept the existing corporate tax rate of 37.50 percent for publicly traded banks, insurance, financial institutions and also for merchant banks.\n\nMahmood Ali proposed that banks, insurance companies and financial institutions that are not publicly traded, will pay the company tax at the rate of 40 percent as before.\n\nAlthough the upcoming budget proposed tax rebates for different companies, the finance minister proposed to increase the tax rate for cooperative societies by 5 percent.\n\nThe tax rate for cooperative societies was hiked from 15 percent to 20 percent in a bid to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio, he said in his budget speech.\n\nAs before, companies making cigarettes and any type of tobacco products will have to pay a 45 percent tax, but the finance minister also proposed adding a 2.5 percent surcharge.\n\nMahmood Ali also proposed that if more than 10 percent of paid capital shares of a publicly traded mobile phone operator were available through IPO, the tax rate would remain at 40 percent as before. But in that case, the company's pre-IPO placement cannot be more than 5 percent.\n\nThose mobile phone operator companies not publicly traded will still have to pay the 45 percent tax rate, the minister said.", "source": {"uri": "bdnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bdnews24.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bdnews24_com@bdnews24.com", "name": "Bdnews24 Com", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_taka", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi taka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abul_Hassan_Mahmood_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Finance_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Finance (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sole_proprietorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sole proprietorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial transaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Share capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merchant bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.bdnews24.com/bdnews24/media/english/imgAll/2024June/PLATE/budget-bag-parliament-060624-04-1717670678.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

It was lower than the 4.0-percent median in a Manila Times poll of economists, but fell within the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas' (BSP) 3.7- percent to 4.5-percent estimate for the month.\n\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy items, decelerated to 3.1 percent from 3.2 percent.\n\nInflation, which has now risen for four straight months, has defied expectations of a breach of the 2.0- to 4.0-percent target, although the BSP warned that the outlook remained tilted toward the upside due to potential increases in food, transport, power and fuel costs.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the Monetary Board will consider the latest inflation outturn in its upcoming monetary policy meeting on 27 June 2024,\" the central bank said in a statement.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n\"The BSP also continues to support the National Government's nonmonetary measures to address supply-side pressures on prices and sustain the disinflation process,\" it added.\n\nAverage inflation remained within target at 3.5 percent. While the central bank still expects a breach moving forward, it said that full-year inflation was expected to be within target for 2024 and 2025.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRice inflation drops\n\nThe PSA, in a statement, said May inflation was \"primarily influenced by the higher year-on-year increase in the index of the housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels at 0.9 percent during the month from 0.4 percent in April 2024.\n\nTransport costs also rose, by 3.5 percent from 2.6 percent.\n\nFood and alcoholic beverages still accounted for over half -- a 56.6-percent share or 2.2 percentage points -- of overall inflation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFood inflation, meanwhile, slowed to 6.1 percent in May from the previous month's 6.3 percent.\n\nRice inflation, which contributed to the uptick in inflation from the previous months, declined to 23.0 percent last month from 23.9 percent in April.\n\nThe drop in food inflation was also driven by a slower year-on-year increase for vegetables, tubers, plantains, cooking bananas and pulses of 2.7 percent from 4.3 percent and a drop in fish and seafood inflation to zero from 0.4 percent.\n\nGovt to pursue reforms\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSocioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, in a separate statement, said the government was increasing its efforts to combat \"persistent inflation drivers.\"\n\n\"The government will continue to implement lasting policy reforms to ensure we address the drivers of food and nonfood inflation sustainably. We want to maintain a macroeconomic environment conducive to investment and high-quality job creation,\" he added\n\nBalisacan noted that the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board had reduced rice tariffs to 15 percent from 35 percent for both in-quota and out-quota imports until 2028.\n\nAlso approved on Monday was the extension to 2028 of reduced tariffs on corn, pork and mechanically deboned meat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The NEDA Board approved the new Comprehensive Tariff Program for 2024-2028, a strategic move to ensure access and affordability to essential commodities while balancing the interests of consumers, local producers and the economy,\" Balisacan continued.\n\n\"On the part of the Executive, we will continue to find supply-side solutions to help manage the price increases of other commodities and keep inflation within the target range in the months to come.\"\n\nRate cut outlook\n\nHSBC Global Research economist Aris Dacanay, meanwhile, said inflation could still go beyond 4.0 percent but added that the government's move to lower rice import tariffs would help keep the rate under control.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The base effects are pretty much unfavorable, [that's why] we do still believe that inflation will breach target,\" he told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\"It will go beyond 4.0 percent,\" Dacanay added, forecasting a range of 4.0 to 4.5 percent until July.\n\nIf the tariff cuts take effect soon, however, the rate could even touch the lower end of the BSP target and give the BSP leeway to start cutting interest rates early.\n\n\"Cutting the tariff rate represents a total shift in policy, posing a large downside risk to our view that full-year inflation in 2025 will average 3.8 percent,\" Dacanay noted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"That said, investors will need to monitor the implementation of the policy since its timely and successful implementation could vastly change the inflation outlook, and thus, the policy rate outlook,\" he added.\n\n\"Cutting ahead of the Fed (US Federal Reserve), however, will still be tricky and would depend on how fast the disinflationary impact of the tariff adjustment would come through,\" Dacanay said.\n\nThe BSP has said that it could start easing in August, ahead of the US central bank that is expected to only do so in September.\n\nLower interest rates, however, could make investing in the Philippines less attractive and the BSP's less hawkish stance has led to the peso hitting 19-month lows.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType":

The BlackBerry study sought to identify the procedures companies currently use to manage and lower the risk of security breaches from their software supply chain, drawing comparisons to previous research conducted in October 2022.\n\nRecovery After an Attack and Impact on the Business\n\nAfter an attack, a little more than half of companies (51 percent) were able to recover from a breach within a week, a slight drop (53 percent) from two years ago - while nearly 40 percent took a month, a slight increase (37 percent) from before. Slightly less than three quarters of attacks (74 percent) came through members of the software supply chain that companies were either not aware of or not monitoring before the breach. This was despite insisting on data encryption (52 percent), security awareness training for staff (48 percent), and multi-factor authentication (44 percent).\n\n\"How a company monitors and manages cybersecurity in their software supply chain has to rely on more than just trust,\" explains Christine Gadsby , Vice President, Product Security, BlackBerry. \"IT leaders must tackle the lack of visibility as a priority.\"\n\nAnd that risk comes with a real price -- in financial loss (64 percent), data loss (59 percent), reputational damage (58 percent), and operational impact (55 percent).\n\nConfidence Buoyed by Monitoring\n\nMore than two thirds of respondents (68 percent) were \"very confident\" that suppliers can identify and prevent a vulnerability. A slightly smaller percentage (63 percent) were \"very confident\" supply chain partners have adequate cybersecurity regulatory and compliance practices. That confidence stems from regular monitoring.\n\nWhen asked how often they inventory their supply chain partners for cybersecurity compliance, 41 percent asked for proof every quarter. These compliance requests include showing a software bill of materials (SBOM) or a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) artifact. The biggest barriers to regular software inventories are lack of technical understanding (51 percent), lack of visibility (46 percent) and lack of effective tools (41 percent).\n\nTelling the Consumer\n\nWith over 75 percent of software supply chains attacked in the last 12 months, what about the consumer/end user? Seventy-eight percent of companies are tracking the impact, but only 65 percent are informing their customers. When asked why not, the top two responses were concerned about the negative impact on corporate reputation (51 percent) and lack of staff resources (45 percent).\n\n\"There is a risk that companies will be afraid of reporting attacks for fear of public shaming and damage to their corporate reputation,\" Gadsby notes. \"Our research comes at a time of increased regulatory and legislative interest in addressing software supply chain security vulnerabilities.\"\n\nOther Notable Statistics\n\nVulnerable components having the biggest impact for organization Operating system - 27 percent Web browser - 21 percent Expected time taken to be notified in the event of a supplier suffering a cyber breachWithin four hours - 34 percent Within 24 hours - 46 percent Within 1-3 days - 18 percent Comparability of suppliers' cybersecurity policiesThey are of comparable strength - 66 percent They are stronger - 30 percent Notes to editor: Research conducted in April 2024 by Coleman Parkes on behalf of BlackBerry , with 1,000 IT decision-makers and Cybersecurity professionals across North America (USA and Canada ), the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Malaysia , and Japan .\n\nAbout BlackBerry\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide.

The S&P 500 gained 7.94 points, or 0.15 percent, to 5,291.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 28.38 points, or 0.17 percent, to 16,857.05.\n\nSix of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in green, with real estate and consumer staples leading the gainers by going up 0.95 percent and 0.93 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, materials and energy led the laggards by dropping 1.22 percent and 0.97 percent, respectively.\n\nThe latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report showed 8.06 million available jobs in April, down from 8.36 million in March and also the lowest level since February 2021.

Of this, an estimated 11.8 percent were from online retail sales, compared to the 12 percent recorded in March 2024.\n\nExcluding motor vehicles, the total retail sales value was about $3.3 billion, of which 13.9 percent were from online retail sales. Online retail sales made up 49 percent of the total sales of computer and telecommunications equipment, 31.5 percent of furniture and household equipment, and 12.6 percent of supermarkets and hypermarkets industries.\n\nSales of food and beverage services increased 0.3 percent in April on a year-on-year basis, continuing the 4.9 percent growth in March.\n\nMonth on month and seasonally adjusted, sales of food and beverage services declined 0.9 percent in April compared with the previous month.\n\nThe total sales value of food and beverage services in April was estimated at $931 million. Of this, an estimated 24 percent were from online sales, higher than the 23.2 percent recorded in March 2024.\n\nSales at food caterers recorded the steepest year-on-year jump, up 21.3 percent in April.

The results, published on May 30, also show state-specific results, with Trump leading Biden 44 percent to 8 percent in Florida, 28 percent to 15 percent in Michigan and 44 percent to 29 percent in Pennsylvania. Both candidates are tied at 22 percent in Virginia, with 23 percent \"not sure.\" (Related: Poll: Trump LEADS Biden in seven key swing states.)\n\nTrump also has a stronger hold on his party's Arab American supporters, with 79 percent of registered Republican Arab Americans backing him. In contrast, only 46 percent of registered Democratic Arab Americans support Biden. Among independent Arab Americans, 27 percent favor Trump, 13 percent back Biden and 33 percent remain undecided.\n\nIn line with the results, the Arab American Institute stressed several key insights from the poll.\n\nFirst, Biden's support is particularly weak among young Arab Americans (ages 18 to 34) and foreign-born Arab Americans, with only eight percent and 10 percent support, respectively. Second, the \"crisis in Gaza\" emerged as the top issue for Arab Americans, with 60 percent identifying it as their primary concern. Alarmingly for Biden, only five percent of respondents approved of his handling of the ongoing and escalating Gaza conflict.\n\nHuman knowledge is under attack!

This dissatisfaction appears to be reflected in the declining support from Arab American voters, a demographic that was previously more supportive of Biden.\n\nThis percentage has dropped dramatically from a solid majority in 2020 when the recent surge in violence in the Middle East had not yet started. That same year, Biden enjoyed 59 percent support from Arab American voters. However, Biden's steadfast support for Israel amid ongoing conflicts in Gaza dropped to 35 percent in 2023 and now to 18 percent.\n\nFor the first time since the poll began in 1997, a majority of Arab Americans did not identify as Democrats.\n\nInstead, 32 percent identified as Republicans and 31 percent as independents. Notably, 40 percent of respondents indicated they would vote for Trump, the likely Republican nominee in 2024, marking a five percent increase from 2020. These voters, who have historically leaned Democratic, are influential in swing states such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nMoreover, the overall approval rating of Biden among Arab Americans is notably low, with only 20 percent rating his job performance as \"good\" and 66 percent holding a negative view of his presidency at that time.\n\nJust like the latest Arab American Institute poll, the 2023 poll revealed that Arab and Muslim Americans view the unwavering financial, political, and military support of Biden for Israel following the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas militant groups as a form of betrayal.\n\nWatch Bill O'Reilly explains why former President Donald Trump governed better than his Democratic predecessor and successor.\n\nBiden frustrated by dismal poll numbers ahead of Trump

This is our tenth year of recognition, and we are proud to be inducted into Seramount's Hall of Fame.\n\nAnnually, Seramount recognizes law firms that utilize best practices in recruiting, retaining, promoting, and developing women lawyers and lawyers from underrepresented groups, including people of color. The 2024 application included over 600 questions about attorney demographics at different levels, flexibility, paid time off and parental leaves, and development and retention of women and people of color as well as those from other underrepresented groups. Questions about family-friendly benefits and mentoring and sponsorship participation were also included.\n\nOur efforts to hire, retain and promote women and people of color continue to result in progress and these results stem from our efforts to understand the needs of our people and respond to those needs. For example, post-pandemic, NGE designed an innovative, highly flexible, 4+4 hybrid work policy with one day in the work week as an all-in day for lawyers and staff in each practice group and department and four additional days per month for attorneys and professional staff to choose to come into the office. As Managing Partner Robert G. Gerber noted, \"Our hybrid work policy embodies the firm's commitment to both professional excellence and personal flexibility. We believe the structure of our policy truly integrates in-person collaboration with increased individual flexibility. When we rolled out the policy, we invited everyone to embrace the spirit of the policy rather than complying simply to check a box. We focused on the intentionality of being in-person on our all-in days to collaborate and increase teamwork and learning, while also providing resources to make meaningful connections virtually. We believe that combination of flexibility and accountability strengthens our firm's culture and enhances our people's professional success and personal well-being.\"\n\n\"Our Best Law Firms for Women and Diversity demonstrate unwavering commitment, despite the uncertainties in the legal field,\" said Subha V. Barry, President of Seramount. \"I'm proud of the steady and positive change they are driving, even if it's a gradual process. I applaud these industry leaders for their dedication to cultivating inclusive firm cultures.\"\n\n2024 Best Law Firms for Women & Diversity Highlights:\n\nRepresentation by the numbers: 42 percent of lawyers are women, same as last year; 27 percent of equity partners are women, same as last year; 24 percent of lawyers are people of color, up from 23 percent last year and 33 percent of lawyers hired are people of color, down from 34 percent last year.Advancement by the numbers: The percentage of women promoted to equity partner is 41 percent, up from 39 percent last year; The percentage of people of color promoted to equity partner is 22 percent, up from 17 percent last year; 100 percent offer formal mentoring programs, up from 96 percent last year; 89 percent offer formal sponsorship programs, up from 82 percent last year and 95 percent of firms have formal policies in place that allow lawyers to move on and off an equity partner track, up from 88 percent last year.Benefits by the numbers: 89 percent of firms offer backup childcare, up from 84 percent last year; 84 percent offer childcare for a sick child, up from 80 percent last year; 89 percent reimburse for in vitro fertilization, up from 80 percent last year; 80 percent reimburse for egg freezing, up from 66 percent last year; and 64 percent reimburse for surrogacy expenses, up from 46 percent last year.Inclusive Practices by the numbers: 56 percent conducted a pay equity analysis within the last year based on both gender and race/ethnicity, up from 52 percent the previous year and 51 percent have Employee Resource Groups for people with disabilities, up from 43 percent last year.\n\nAbout NGE\n\nNeal Gerber Eisenberg is a leading law firm that handles sophisticated matters for entrepreneurs, public companies, and private businesses and their owners.

However, there were increases in robbery and felony assault, often involving offenders escaping on illegal motorized scooters and bikes.\n\nThe city's transit system continued to show improvement, with crime rates falling by 10.6 percent in May, maintaining a trend of significant decreases over the past four months. In total, 261 fewer crimes were reported across the five boroughs this May compared to last year. Murder rates decreased by 21.1 percent with 30 incidents reported compared to 38 the previous year.\n\nDespite these positive trends, shooting incidents rose by 4.7 percent, with 89 incidents reported up from 85 in May 2023. This led to an increase in shooting victims by 9.1 percent. However, year-to-date figures indicate a 12.4 percent decrease in shooting incidents and a 12.5 percent reduction in victims.\n\nThe NYPD's efforts in gun control have been notable, with 571 firearms confiscated in May, contributing to a total of nearly 2,750 illegal guns seized year-to-date. Since January 2022, over 16,400 illegal firearms have been removed from the streets.\n\nRobbery incidents saw a 4.7 percent increase, while felony assaults went up by 7.4 percent. Conversely, vehicle thefts decreased by 9.1 percent, burglaries by 7.5 percent, and grand larcenies by 6.9 percent. The public housing complexes and subway system also reported minor decreases in crime.\n\nBias incidents, particularly anti-Jewish crimes, have seen a significant increase, with a 54 percent rise in overall bias incidents and a 150 percent surge in anti-Jewish offenses compared to May 2023. Anti-Asian crimes, however, decreased by 83 percent.\n\nThe NYPD has intensified its crackdown on \"ghost vehicles\" and illegal motorized scooters, bikes, and ATVs, with numerous operations leading to hundreds of arrests and vehicle seizures.

In this article, research data about divorce are presented -- empirical findings from various credible sources, not from the Philippines of course, as there is none yet. This brings discourse to a higher level, as critical thinking adds value to greater understanding, respect for diverse opinions, better decisions and evidence-based policy formulation. The findings neither intend to generalize nor presume that they apply to the Philippine experience, but somehow can stimulate thinking and more evidence-based exchanges for the greater and deeper understanding of this very complex issue -- divorce.\n\nDivorce in the US (Forbes, 2024)\n\nIn the US, 2.1 million marriages occurred (6.2 per 1,000 people) and a total of 673,989 divorces and annulments (2022). Both marriages and dissolutions show downward trends.\n\nThe average length of a marriage prior to divorce is eight years. Forty-three percent of all marriages are dissolved. Second and third marriages actually fail at a far higher rate, with 60 percent and 73 percent ending up in divorce, respectively. Divorce in the US is fast and easy -- contested divorces usually take over a year to finalize and simple divorces can be completed in three months. An average of $7,000 (P380,000) is spent by a couple.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nWho is likely to divorce?\n\nLiving together prior to marriage is one predictor of the likelihood of divorce. Among those who lived together before engagement, 34 percent ended in divorce compared with just 22 percent dissolution among couples who waited until after marriage to cohabitate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere seems to be a social contagion as studies show that couples who have friends who divorce have a 75-percent increase in the risk of their marriage ending. Even couples with two degrees of separation from divorce still have a 33 percent greater risk. The marital stability within a couple's social network also plays a role in whether their marriage lasts.\n\nWhy divorce?\n\nStudies report many different reasons for ending a marital relationship, with lack of commitment as the most common reason (75 percent), exceeding infidelity (60 percent) as causes cited. Nearly a quarter cited domestic abuse, a serious crime, as the cause of divorce. Domestic violence was the ultimate cause of divorce for 21 percent of couples, and 12 percent said substance abuse was the deciding issue. Forty-five percent rationalized the excuse of having been married too young, with 72 percent of couples reporting they didn't fully understand the commitment involved in marriage before they said \"I do.\"\n\nThirty-eight percent report financial problems. Money is a leading cause of marital conflict, so unsurprisingly, couples with lower incomes face a higher likelihood of divorce. Living below the poverty level can cause enormous stress as cited by a study that found that as many as 46 percent of adults ages 18 to 55 who live below the poverty level have divorced. Twelve percent of men and 19 percent of women who lived below the poverty line were divorced in 2022. Also, in 2021, 21 percent of divorces involved men not in the labor force, and 22 percent of divorces involved women who were not working.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, as income increases, the divorce rate steadily decreases from 40 percent to 30 percent. But as studies suggest that increasing income can reduce the risk of divorce, once income climbs too high, a different set of complications can threaten the stability of a marriage.\n\nEducation level affects the chances of a marriage succeeding. Note the divorce rate for people across variables: education of high school or less (39 percent for men, 37 percent for women); individuals with a high school diploma (38.8 percent); with less than a high school diploma (45.3 percent), while the divorce rate for people with an advanced education (26 percent for men and 30 percent for women), and a bachelor's degree or higher (29 percent of men and 32 percent of women).\n\nForty-two percent of people between ages 45 and 54 have been divorced, an age bracket that may still remarry. Gray divorce, those who end a marriage at age 50 or older, shows greater disadvantage to women with a 45-percent decline in their living standards after a gray divorce. This is due to the compromise and limitation on their careers due to homemaking responsibilities.\n\nTo be continued next Friday, June 14, 2024", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evidence-based medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empirical evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annulment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohabitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cohabitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty threshold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manila_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Manila Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Domestic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_diploma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school diploma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homemaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homemaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workforce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workforce"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/06/06/356061.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-06-", "textStart": 4633, "textEnd": 4640}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

That was enough to excite Wall Street and get LULU shares moving in the right direction after the market closed on June 5.\n\nWhile the active lifestyle industry and Wall Street may see Lululemon as one of the Big 2, along with Nike in performance, when listening to company CEO Calvin McDonald talk about the LULU business on a conference call with analysts, it sounds like the brand is still one of the better-kept brand secrets outside of Canada. This reality provides the brand with a significant runway for additional growth.\n\nIt wasn't long ago that the market was ready to write off Lululemon as new challenges befell Nike, and LULU had its issues to address, including the recent departure of Chief Product Officer Sun Choe for a new opportunity to run the Vans brand for VF Corp.\n\nThe bottom line is that the first quarter could have been better for established active lifestyle brands and retailers, but LULU looks to remain included in the same breath with On, Hoka, Vuori, and other next-gen brands leading in growth and brand admiration.\n\nLululemon's first-quarter sales increase 10 percent year-over-year to $2.2 billion, or an 11 percent increase in constant-dollar terms. Comparable sales increased 6 percent, or 7 percent on a constant-dollar basis, for the first quarter.\n\nAmericas net revenue increased 3 percent or 4 percent on a constant-dollar basis in the first quarter. Americas region comparable sales were flat year-over-year.\n\nAddressing the U.S., McDonald said the company saw a slower start to the year due to several internal factors, including a missed opportunity in women's and bags, which he said it was actively addressing, and ongoing choppiness in today's consumer environment.\n\n\"Our men's business maintained its momentum, driven by strong guest response to our innovations across performance, lounge and our ABC franchise,\" McDonald said. \"Our market share gains were strong in men's in quarter one, and with unaided brand awareness of less than 20 percent in the U.S., our opportunity to continue to grow this business remains significant.\"\n\nMcDonald said the company had not maximized the business in the U.S. in the first quarter due to several missed opportunities, including a color palette and its core assortment, particularly in leggings, that were too narrow.\n\n\"Where we had color, guests responded well; we just needed more as they are looking for additional choices,\" he said. McDonald said the company is also out of stock in some smaller sizes and saw a fantastic response to newer bag styles, including its two-tone tote, but LULU \"did not buy these styles with enough depth to fully capture the demand.\"\n\nInternational net revenue increased 35 percent, or a 40 percent increase on a constant-dollar basis, in Q1. International comparable sales increased 25 percent year-over-year, or 29 percent growth on a constant-dollar basis.\n\nChina Mainland increased 45 percent on a reported basis, or 52 percent in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing 33 percent.\n\nRest of World (ROW) revenue grew by 27 percent on a reported basis, or 30 percent in constant currency, with comparable sales increasing by 26 percent.\n\n\"Our business remains strong in every international market in which we operate as our brand resonates with guests across regions and geographies,\" McDonald shared. \"Our approach to growth follows the model we've implemented so successfully in North America and includes omni-channel distribution via highly productive stores and e-commerce sites, a product assortment that offers technical and versatile styles and is frequently updated with new innovations to enable our guests to sweat in any way they choose and a unique and compelling approach to building brand awareness, which includes local activations as well as larger-scale brand campaigns.\"\n\nMcDonald said that international business remains under-penetrated and represents \"a significant growth opportunity. \"For the full year 2023, International was only 21 percent of our business, and over the long run, I see the potential for it to grow to 50 percent as we continue to expand our presence outside of North America,\" he forecasted.\n\nChannel Highlights\n\nStore channel total sales increased 12 percent in the quarter. LULU ended the quarter with 711 stores worldwide. Square footage increased 14 percent compared to last year, reportedly driven by the addition of 49 new Lululemon stores since Q1 of 2023. During the quarter, LULU completed three optimizations.\n\nDigital channel revenue increased 8 percent in Q1 and contributed $906 million to the top line, or 41 percent of the total revenue.\n\nCategory Highlights\n\nBy merchandise category, Women's increased 10 percent, Men's increased 15 percent, and Accessories remained positive, up 2 percent, which the company said was impressive given the solid performance in Q1 last year.\n\nMexico Operations\n\nCompany CFO Meghan Frank gave a quick update on the company's acquisition of its Mexico operations.\n\n\"In May, we signed an agreement with our franchise partners to acquire their Lululemon Mexico operations and the 15 retail locations they currently operate,\" she revealed. \"Our partner has built an incredible foundation for our brand in Mexico, and our acquisition will allow us to more efficiently continue to expand, grow our community and enhance the guest experience.\"\n\nFrank said LULU is acquiring the business for approximately $160 million in cash, and the deal is expected to close in the next several weeks, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\n\"From a P&L standpoint, we expect the transaction to have an immaterial impact on our financial results for the fiscal year 2024,\" she noted.\n\nIncome Statement\n\nGross profit increased 11 percent to $1.3 billion, with gross margin improving 20 basis points to 57.7 percent of net sales in the Q1 period.\n\nIncome from operations increased 8 percent to $432.6 million and operating margin contracted 50 basis points to 19.6 percent of net sales.\n\nThe effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 29.5 percent compared to 29.1 percent for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $2.54 compared to $2.28 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn addition, LULU repurchased nearly $300 million of stock in the first quarter, an additional $230 million in the second quarter thus far, and the board recently increased authorization by $1 billion, bringing capacity to repurchase shares up to approximately $1.7 billion.\n\nBalance Sheet Highlights\n\nThe company ended the first quarter of 2024 with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and the capacity under its committed revolving credit facility was $393.8 million.\n\nInventories at the end of the first quarter of 2024 decreased 15 percent to $1.3 billion compared to $1.6 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2023.\n\nOutlook\n\nSecond Quarter\n\nIn the second quarter, Lululemon expects net revenue to range from $2.40 billion to $2.42 billion, representing a 9 percent to 10 percent growth, roughly in line with the Q1 growth rate. \"Our guidance for the full year continues to call for revenue growth of 10 percent to 11 percent, excluding the 53rd week, and includes a modest step-up in the second half,\" said McDonald.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are expected to range from $2.92 to $2.97 for the quarter, assuming a tax rate of approximately 30 percent.\n\n\"In summary, we are moving in the right direction and understand the root cause of the issues,\" the CEO noted. \"And with the lead times, we expect to be in a more optimal inventory position in the second half of 2024.\"\n\nMcDonald said upcoming product launches and innovation flows are skewed toward the back half of the year, which is another reason for optimism.\n\n\"Looking out further, our growth opportunities in the U.S. remain compelling. Our unaided brand awareness is only in the low 30s,\" he said.\n\nFull Year 2024\n\nFor 2024, the company continues to expect net revenue to be in the range of $10.7 billion to $10.8 billion, representing growth of 11 percent to 12 percent or 10 percent to 11 percent, excluding the 53rd week of 2024.\n\n\"In 2024, our plan calls for five to 10 new store openings and 15 to 20 optimizations,\" the CEO noted. \"Looking beyond 2024, our real estate opportunities in the U.S. remain significant, and our plans include continuing our new store opening program and optimization strategy. And we continue to gain market share with outsized strength in men's where we outpaced the overall market in quarter one.\"\n\nLULU continues to expect the operating margin for the year to be approximately 23.3 percent of net sales.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are now expected to range from $14.27 to $14.47 for the year, assuming a tax rate of approximately 30 percent.\n\nProduct and Innovation Structure\n\nMcDonald also addressed Choe's departure and walked through the succession plan and restructuring on that side of the business.\n\n\"Sun and I had been in regular conversations, so I understood her personal and career goals,\" McDonald shared. \"We regularly update our succession plans, which allowed us to seamlessly step into our new plan leadership structure. I'm excited about how the new structure will bring new perspectives, curiosity and leadership across our product teams. This approach will drive several meaningful benefits in the near and long term, including increasing our speed of innovation, stimulating creativity, and enhancing team accountability around product flows and assortment.\"\n\nMcDonald said they have a strong and dynamic product team led by Jonathan Cheung, global creative director, who now reports to McDonald. Liz Binder, chief merchandising officer, now reports to Nikki Neuburger in her newly expanded role as chief brand and product activation officer. McDonald said that under Neuburger's proven leadership, the merchant and the brand teams will be more fully integrated, which will streamline decision-making and ensure LULU shows up powerfully and consistently across all markets.\n\n\"All of this is intended to speed the ideation process with regard to product storytelling and further improve our speed-to-market,\" he said.\n\n\"Jonathan, Liz and the entire product team will continue to drive innovation, design technical product that looks great, and solve for the unmet needs of our guests,\" McDonald concluded.", "source": {"uri":

The average U.S. worker made $71,730 in 2022, the latest year with U.S. Census Bureau data available.\n\nAuto retail is \"easy to be successful [in] if you aren't afraid of work or learning,\" a rural Massachusetts white and Hispanic general manager at a Honda retailer wrote in the survey.\n\nThis near-parity on salary and other similarities suggested members of minority groups in auto retail have more in common professionally with nonminority whites than men in the industry have in common with women.\n\nMen in auto retail made $218,675 in 2023 compared with the $144,383 averaged by women in the sector. Men and women also showed a greater divergence in auto retail departments, managerial status and commission reliance than minorities and whites.\n\nThe online study, conducted from August through October 2023 by Research + Knowledge = Insights, drew responses from more than 1,000 U.S. dealership employees. Results were weighted to keep demographic representation consistent.\n\nEighty-five percent of all respondents were men, 13 percent were women and 2.2 percent declined to answer. The average person polled had 27.2 years in the industry. Managers made up 78 percent of respondents.\n\nThe study asked respondents whether they were white, Black, Native American, Hispanic, Asian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, a member of a religion that experiences discrimination, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, had a physical or health challenge, or had a mental health issue or were neurodiverse. \"Other\" was also an option. Respondents could select more than one answer.\n\nThe survey firm classified 18 percent of the auto retail professionals as members of one of the minority demographics specified. This population included 62 people who also described themselves as white. The other 82 percent of respondents called themselves white and not a member of any of the other groups.\n\nSixty-nine percent of minorities in auto retail were managers, less than the 81 percent of whites found in the study but a smaller spread than was seen between the 56 percent of women and 82 percent of men in managerial roles.\n\nMinorities were most likely to work in variable operations, with 37 percent of the group in that business segment compared with 27 percent of nonminority whites. Fixed operations was the next most common workplace at 26 percent of the minority population, compared with 37 percent of whites. Corporate and administration jobs tied for third at 13 percent of minorities, compared with 11 percent and 7.3 percent of whites, respectively. The remaining 12 percent of minorities were dealership executives, compared with 18 percent of whites. With the exception of variable operations, the differences between the percentages of minorities and whites in the departments were all smaller than the spread between women and men.\n\nMinorities estimated they drew 54 percent of their salary from commissions, compared with the 51 percent commission estimated by whites. In contrast, men were 55 percent commission, while women only saw 30 percent of their pay tied to incentives.\n\nTwenty percent of the minorities said auto retail lacked diversity, compared with 6.4 percent of the nonminority whites. Minorities were also more likely to call the industry unwelcoming to people of color; 8.7 percent of minorities shared this sentiment, compared with 1.7 percent of whites. And 8.3 percent of minorities said they had considered leaving their job or found another one because of a lack of diversity in the workplace, compared with 1.3 percent of whites.\n\nJamey Holt, a survey respondent who works as a real estate agent but had spent more than 20 years in auto retail, agreed the industry lacked diversity and said it wasn't welcoming to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n\"It tends to be a little bit old-school,\" said Holt, who is white and gay. \"Kind of definitely male-dominated, but it's not as open and welcoming as it could be.\" This was the case for \"my part of it,\" and he said he suspected women and people of color would have a similar experience.\n\nHowever, Holt said he didn't feel unwelcome at his last dealership, Hennessy Porsche North Atlanta in Georgia, where he worked in the finance department from June 2013 to June 2022.\n\n\"They were very welcoming, and they were great to work with, and there was no issues or anything there,\" he said. \"Everybody was fantastic.\" He said this was also the case at a BMW dealership he'd worked for earlier.\n\nHispanics were the most common minority group responding to the Automotive News study, at 7.1 percent of the survey population and 39 percent of the minority respondents. Blacks were the second-largest minority group participating, represented by 3.5 percent of the industry and 19 percent of the minority respondents. Asians were the third-most prevalent group, reflected by 2.9 percent of those surveyed and 16 percent of the minority population. Members of religions suffering discrimination and the country's native population rounded out the top five minority groups captured by the survey.\n\nMinorities in auto retail were more likely than nonminority whites to be female (18 percent to 12 percent) or prefer not to disclose their gender (4.2 percent to 0.6 percent), according to the salary survey.\n\nThey were also more likely to be younger -- 54 percent were below the age of 50, compared with 33 percent of the nonminority white respondents -- and have less time in the industry, though both groups had auto retail careers spanning more than two decades. Minorities averaged 22.5 years in the industry compared with 28.3 years for whites.\n\n\"I fell into this business and then fell in love with it,\" wrote a rural Pennsylvania fixed operations manager at a Honda retailer who described herself as white, Black and a 25-year veteran of the industry. \"I love what I do. I love helping people learn how to do it well. I DO NOT love how ridiculous the corporate and manufacturer side of things has become and I especially loathe the way we cater to the most vile, unrealistic customers on the planet.\"", "source":

As of the reporting date, pure US dollar ICR for the local business units constituted 82 percent of the total ICR compared to 34 percent in the prior year,\" said the group in an update for the period.\n\nFMHL revealed that the insurance service result grew by 3 percent to US$4,6 million from the prior year on the back of increased ICR from the group's insurance business units.\n\nHowever, the insurance service result growth was lower than ICR due to higher claims in the period that were partially offset by reinsurance recoveries.\n\nAccording to the group, rental income for the quarter was US$2 million, representing a 25 percent increase on the same period in the prior year.\n\nThe growth compared to the prior year arose from the increased uptake of USD leases by tenants. A sector report by real estate firm Knight Frank Zimbabwe shows that the real estate's ability to generate cash in US dollars has helped offset the currency and exchange rate volatility.\n\nLandlords are largely pegging their properties in US dollars, across segments - from residential to commercial.\n\nBy the close of the quarter, pure US dollar rentals for the group totalled US$1,4 million, contributing 72 percent of total rental income, representing a 43 percent increase from prior year.

The vacation rental market has also cooled from previous years, with owners of short-term rentals earning less revenues.\n\nThe Austin, Texas, metropolitan area had the biggest loss in second-home mortgage applications, with a 62.5 percent drop, followed closely by metropolitan San Francisco at 57.6 percent, New York City at 53.9 percent (including the popular Hamptons destinations on Long Island), and Seattle at 53 percent.\n\nAccording to the Mortgage Bankers Association, a national organization based in Washington, D.C., rates have climbed over the past week, while mortgage applications have declined. \"Mortgage rates moved slightly higher last week, with the 30-year conforming rate reaching 7.07 percent -- its highest level since early May,\" said Mike Fratantoni, MBA senior vice president and chief economist. \"After adjusting for the Memorial Day holiday, both purchase and refinance application volumes were down, with purchase activity specifically 13 percent below last year's level.\"\n\nThe Boston metropolitan area saw a 43.9 percent drop in mortgage applications, and Cape Cod -- a nearby popular vacation destination for many Bostonians -- is experiencing a similar situation. Amy Marseglia, broker associate with William Raveis Real Estate in Eastham, Cape Cod, said while there are a high number of potential buyers, the lack of inventory is holding them back. \"Housing inventory has been suppressed here for a few years now, and the people who still want homes are backing up,\" she told The Epoch Times.\n\nAnother reason why mortgage applications are down is that fact that many buyers are still offering cash. \"It's a desirable location, and there are a lot of people coming in with cash offers to buy something here,\" said Ms. Marseglia. Some are purchasing second homes for themselves or for vacation-rental income.\n\nTypically, homes in good condition are being scooped up almost as soon as they come onto the market, and bidding wars are still common. \"It depends on the price point as to how much over the asking price a potential buyer will offer,\" explained Ms. Marseglia. \"Homes priced over $1 million will tend to get much higher over-asking amounts.\"\n\nLast year, just 3 percent of all mortgages nationwide went to second-home buyers, representing a 5 percent drop from 2020. Generation X (aged 43-58) purchased almost 30 percent of vacation homes in 2023. Millennials (35-43) make up 21 percent of the vacation home-buying market, and baby boomers (65-74) at 11.4 percent. Generation Z, including those under the age of 35, comprised only 6.9 percent of these buyers.\n\nThe Redfin report also states that 86 percent of people who took out mortgages for vacation homes in 2023 were high earners with a national median household income of $178,000. Caucasian homebuyers were responsible for 79 percent of vacation-home mortgages, while Asian and Hispanic homebuyers comprised just 6.4 percent and 6.2 percent, respectively. African American buyers took just 2.7 percent of those mortgages.\n\n\"Most of the buyers I'm working with now fall in that Gen X range, but I do see a lot of early 'boomers' as well,\" added Ms. Marseglia. On the selling side, she indicated some people are either upsizing or downsizing on the Cape or moving away from the area.\n\nSecond-home mortgages remained very popular throughout Florida, with West Palm Beach showing the largest share of all mortgage originations with almost 7 percent. Orlando and Tampa were the next two top spots in the Sunshine State with 4.1 percent and 3.6 percent, respectively.\n\nDavid Serle, president of Broward, Palm Beaches & St. Lucie Realtors told The Epoch Times that the second home market has cooled down a bit on Florida's east coast, just north of Miami. \"A lot of people are still paying cash and if they are taking a mortgage, they're making significantly higher down payments to keep the monthly mortgage payments lower,\" he said.\n\nMr. Serle indicated the single-family market is good, while condo sales are slower. \"I think that may be due to increasing condo fees and assessments that could be preventing people from making purchases\" he said.\n\nMost of his clients are looking for vacation properties to use for themselves, while some do intend to rent them out at least some of the time. With the median price of a single-family home at about $650,000, the area is very attractive to people who are looking to get more for their money than in Miami. \"We're seeing a big influx from California, and the international market seems to be coming back,\" he added.\n\nInventory remains lower than normal -- with about 4.4 months' supply -- adding to the current sellers' market. Mr. Serle's clientele is a mixture of millennials as well as baby boomers, and since Florida usually doesn't experience seasonal climate, potential buyers are looking for properties all year round.\n\nThe smallest declines in second-home mortgages were in relatively affordable metropolitan areas in the middle of the country and on the East Coast: the Missouri cities of St. Louis (-25.2 percent year over year) and Kansas City (-31.1 percent); Providence, Rhode Island (-31.1 percent); Montgomery County, Pennsylvania (-32.1 percent); and Warren, Michigan (-32.1 percent).", "source":

[and] nothing is saved, then the potential, the highest, the maximum growth it could deliver is 1.4 percentage points,\" Dacanay added.\n\nThe 20-percentage-point cut in rice tariffs, to 15 percent from 25 percent, could free up about 2.0 percent of household budgets for other spending, he explained.\n\nThis will be especially beneficial for low-income households, which spend a larger share of their budgets on rice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince household consumption accounts for 70 percent of the economy, the additional spending power will support household consumption and boost overall growth.", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HSBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aris_Thessaloniki_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aris Thessaloniki F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manila_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Manila Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumption (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Wheelchair", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Growth_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Growth and Development", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.manilatimes.net/manilatimes/uploads/images/2024/06/05/355754.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The April load factor was 82.4 percent (+1.0ppt compared to April 2023).\n\nInternational demand rose 15.8 percent compared to April 2023; capacity was up 14.8 percent year-on-year and the load factor improved to 82.2 percent (+0.7ppt in April 2023).\n\nDomestic demand rose 4.0 percent compared to April 2023; capacity was up 2.1 percent year-on-year and the load factor was 82.6 percent (+1.5ppt compared to April 2023).\n\nAll regions showed strong growth for international passenger markets in April 2024 compared to April 2023. The load factor increased to a two-year high, and capacity increases were well-matched to demand.\n\nAfrican airlines saw a 15.5 percent year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity was up 10.4 percent year-on-year. The load factor rose to 73.0 percent (+3.2ppt compared to April 2023).\n\nAsia-Pacific airlines continue to lead the way, with a 32.1 percent year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 29.3 percent year-on-year and the load factor rose to 83.7 percent (+1.7ppt compared to April 2023). Traffic flows from the Middle East and Africa to Asia are notably strong.\n\nEuropean carriers saw a 10.1 percent year-on-year increase in demand. Capacity increased 10.0 percent year-on-year, and the load factor was 83.3 percent (up just 0.1ppt compared to April 2023).

The BlackBerry study sought to identify the procedures companies currently use to manage and lower the risk of security breaches from their software supply chain, drawing comparisons to previous research conducted in October 2022.\n\nAfter an attack, a little more than half of companies (51 percent) were able to recover from a breach within a week, a slight drop (53 percent) from two years ago \" while nearly 40 percent took a month, a slight increase (37 percent) from before. Slightly less than three quarters of attacks (74 percent) came through members of the software supply chain that companies were either not aware of or not monitoring before the breach. This was despite insisting on data encryption (52 percent), security awareness training for staff (48 percent), and multi-factor authentication (44 percent).\n\n\"How a company monitors and manages cybersecurity in their software supply chain has to rely on more than just trust,\" explains , Vice President, Product Security, BlackBerry. \"IT leaders must tackle the lack of visibility as a priority.\"\n\nAnd that risk comes with a real price -- in financial loss (64 percent), data loss (59 percent), reputational damage (58 percent), and operational impact (55 percent).\n\nMore than two thirds of respondents (68 percent) were \"very confident\" that suppliers can identify and prevent a vulnerability. A slightly smaller percentage (63 percent) were \"very confident\" supply chain partners have adequate cybersecurity regulatory and compliance practices. That confidence stems from regular monitoring.\n\nWhen asked how often they inventory their supply chain partners for cybersecurity compliance, 41 percent asked for proof every quarter. These compliance requests include showing a software bill of materials (SBOM) or a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) artifact. The biggest barriers to regular software inventories are lack of technical understanding (51 percent), lack of visibility (46 percent) and lack of effective tools (41 percent).\n\nWith over 75 percent of software supply chains attacked in the last 12 months, what about the consumer/end user? Seventy-eight percent of companies are tracking the impact, but only 65 percent are informing their customers. When asked why not, the top two responses were concerned about the negative impact on corporate reputation (51 percent) and lack of staff resources (45 percent).\n\n\"There is a risk that companies will be afraid of reporting attacks for fear of public shaming and damage to their corporate reputation,\" Gadsby notes. \"Our research comes at a time of increased regulatory and legislative interest in addressing software supply chain security vulnerabilities.\"\n\nNotes to editor: Research conducted in by on behalf of BlackBerry, with 1,000 IT decision-makers and Cybersecurity professionals across ( and ), the , , , , and .\n\nBlackBerry (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments worldwide.

Last November WSTS was predicting the market would grow by 11.8 percent. After 16-percent growth in 2024 WSTS is predicting 12.5 percent growth in 2025 to take the market to an annual value of US$687.38 billion.\n\nMeanwhile Malcolm Penn of analysis firm Future Horizons has just reduced his growth forecast. He was predicting 16 percent growth for 2024 but dropped his forecast to 4.9 percent (see Analyst drops chip market forecast after 1Q24 \"train wreck\"). Penn sounded warnings that such growth as has been seen so far is based on increases in average selling prices without a corresponding increase in units shipped.\n\nNonetheless, WSTS has predicted growth driven by stronger than previously expected sales in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions and weaker sales in Europe and Japan. This is in-line with the narrative that consumer electronics sales and enterprise computing are bouncing back while industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure are being more cautious after supply chain corrections.\n\nThe forecast consumer and enterprise surge likely rests on the basis of extended replacement cycles for smartphones and personal computers becoming irresistible and exceptionally strong demand for AI in both the datacenter and at the edge.\n\nFor 2024, WSTS anticipates that two IC categories will drive the growth for the year with double-digit percentage increases, logic with 10.7 percent and memory with 76.8 percent. Conversely, other categories such as discrete, optoelectronics, sensors, and analog Semiconductors are expected to experience single-digit declines.\n\nThe Americas and Asia Pacific regions are projected to see significant growth, with increases of 25.1 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively. In contrast, Europe is expected to show marginal growth of 0.5 percent, while Japan is forecasted to see a slight decline of 1.1 percent.\n\nThe following year will also be driven by primarily by the memory and logic sectors, which are set to be worth more US$200 billion in 2025 each, representing an upward trend of over 25 percent for memory and over 10 percent for Llogic from the previous year. All other segments are anticipated to record single-digit growth rates.\n\nIn 2025, all regions are poised for continued expansion. The Americas and Asia Pacific are expected to maintain their double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nwww.wsts.org\n\nAnalyst drops chip market forecast after 1Q24 \"train wreck\"\n\nWSTS lowers global chip market forecast for 2023", "source": {"uri": "eenewseurope.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eeNews Europe"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_clarke@eenewseurope.com", "name": "Peter Clarke", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSTS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "WSTS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Logic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Americas"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analog signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optoelectronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optoelectronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy_and_Forecasting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Strategy and Forecasting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://ee.cdnartwhere.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WSTSspring24_630.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

This is the ultimate kitchen table issue.\n\nYou can't use GDP or other top-down macro indicators when you go to the grocery store or the gas station, or pay the electricity bill, or the phone company, or the cable man. \"Take-home pay\" is what Reagan called it.\n\nHere are some representative numbers. Real wages during the Trump years increased by nearly $6,000 for the average family. For the Biden years, that key number fell $2,000. That's a nearly $8,000-swing in favor of Trump and against Mr.Biden.\n\nInflation under Trump rose 1.9 percent annually, but over 6 percent annually under Mr. Biden.\n\nThere are roughly 135 million investors who feel the stock market from their IRA's, 401K's, and pensions funds. Including union pension funds.\n\nAdjusted for inflation, though, investors in the S&P 500 saw a 51 percent gain under Trump. So far under Mr. Biden, they're up just 15 percent.\n\nEven worse, the level of consumer prices rose almost 20 percent under Mr. Biden but only increased 7 percent under Trump.\n\nDuring the Biden years, groceries are up 21 percent, gasoline up 45 percent, electricity up 27 percent, new and used cars up almost 20 percent, shelter and rent up more than 20 percent. These are all killers. That's what people think about.\n\nAnd, with Bidenflation, interest rates have soared. Mortgage rates up over 7 percent, car loans running up around 10 percent, credit cards up 25-30 percent.\n\nThese high personal borrowing costs are also killers. Essentially, working folks cannot afford the Biden economy.\n\nThat's why Trump runs twenty points ahead of him on that issue.\n\nThere's another comprehensive measure called household wealth, which includes all your cash, the value of your home, your stocks, and then subtract out the money you owe other people.\n\nThere's about 135 million Americans in the stock market and home prices have risen, but it turns out household wealth rose 16 percent after inflation during the Trump term, but less than 1 percent during Mr. Biden's presidency. Another killer.\n\nWe haven't exhausted everything on this subject or the debate, but Trump has a decided advantage. Folks did better while he was in the White House.\n\nTrump should also leverage his tax cuts into a future prosperity and optimism picture, while Mr. Biden is going to be up there all pessimistic and blaming so-called rich people -- even though virtually every taxpayer benefited from the Trump tax cuts.\n\nA tax-cut and growth and prosperity message from Trump could be a real sleeper, come the election.\n\nAnd I'll tell you what -- of all these indicators, real income is probably the most important one for predicting the presidential election race, according to leading political scientists down through the years.\n\nAnd you know what else? People tend to make up their mind and lock in their decision more or less right now between early summer and Labor Day.\n\nBy September, their minds are completely made up, even though there are still a bunch of weeks before the election.\n\nI would say, right now, advantage Trump.

The country's current account surplus is also forecast to expand to $61 billion from $35.5 billion during the same period.\n\nOn the domestic front, however, high inflation and high interest rates will continue to weigh on domestic demand this year.\n\nThe research center called on the government to take necessary measures to prop up consumption and investments in line with robust exports for an economic growth.\n\nThe HRI's growth outlook is higher than the forecasts released by the Korean government, its central bank and global organizations.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development revised up its outlook for Korea's economic growth this year to 2.6 percent from its earlier projection in February of 2.2 percent.\n\nThe forecast was rosier than the growth outlook for Korea of 2.3 percent by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThe Korean government projected 2.2 percent growth and the Bank of Korea presented a 2.1 percent forecast.

But behind every moment of transformation lies a silent yet indispensable force - the supply chain. It is the unsung hero, the invisible backbone that supports and sustains the very fabric of change,\" he opined.\n\nMr. Frimpong stated that the industrial revolution, a seismic shift that ushered in an era of unprecedented progress and prosperity, was still hinged on the emergence of efficient supply chains connecting raw materials to factories and markets with unprecedented speed and scale.\n\nHe said similarly, the rise of the digital age has been made possible by intricate networks of supply chains enabling the seamless flow of information, goods, and services across the globe at the click of a button.\n\nHowever, Mr. Frimpong Barimah indicated that it's not just in grand historical moments that the supply chain has played a transformative role; in every industry worldwide, it serves as the lifeblood of economic activity, facilitating the creation, production, and distribution of goods and services that touch the lives of billions.\n\nHe noted that in recent years, global supply chains have come under immense pressure due to unprecedented trade turbulence, economic uncertainty, geopolitical events, and natural disasters.\n\nMr. Frimpong stated, \"Although the integration of African economies into global supply chains is relatively low compared with other regions, disruptions to supply chain operations have a more than proportionate adverse impact on our economies. This gives relevance to our theme for this year's summit - Africa's Supply Chain Resilience for Economic Transformation. We can only be resilient and drive the expected economic transformation through value addition.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Africa's export of few manufactured goods is an indication of our weak participation in supply chain trade. The 54 countries of Africa combined account for only 2.6 percent of global trade. This figure drops to 0.8 percent when only manufactured goods are considered (COMTRADE/UNSTAT 2023)\".\n\n\"The share of manufactured goods in total exports is only 34 percent (66% of exports are without value addition) for African countries, which is relatively low compared with 83 percent for East Asia, 74 percent for low- and middle-income countries excluding African countries, 68 percent for South Asia, 45 percent for Latin America, and 70 percent for the world average (UN COMTRADE 2023). Half of the manufactured products exported by the continent come from only three countries: South Africa (27 percent), Egypt (10 percent), and Morocco (10 percent).\n\nMr. Frimpong further explained that; \"Thirteen countries out of 54 produce 81 percent of the manufactured exports. This concentration of export countries is even more pronounced when considering only fully transformed goods. Three countries (South Africa, 28 percent; Morocco, 15 percent; and Nigeria, 12 percent) sell 55 percent of fully transformed product exports.\n\n\"In sharp contrast with other regions of the world, especially the countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), African exports have so far not been connected to regional supply chains. Regional value chains only accounted for 2.7 percent of Africa's GVC participation in 2022, compared with 26.4 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean and 42.9 percent in developing Asia, often called 'factory Asia' to emphasize that supply chain trade remains within the region. Among the five AU regions, the participation rate is lowest for North Africa and highest for East Africa, at around 5 percent. This is why the AfCFTA has declared the development of RVCs a priority objective. The GVC participation indicators show that among Asian and Pacific countries (excluding high-income countries), the degree of regional integration was almost six times higher than in Africa in 2022, and the trend hasn't changed.\"", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain",

While the convergence of the eastern EU countries with their western neighbours in GDP per-capita terms has been studied widely, household disposable income has received less attention. GDP includes the incomes of workers, corporate and self-employed profits, and the balance between production and import taxes and production subsidies. While GDP is the most widely used indicator of economic performance, household income is more relevant for individuals, since it indicates the means they have to live on. Looking at household incomes allows an analysis of how different segments of society have benefitted from the past twenty years of income convergence.\n\nAverage income levels\n\nThe countries that joined the EU two decades ago embarked on a spectacular convergence process towards the income levels in rich Western European nations (Figure 1). Research suggests that Western European countries also benefitted from the expanded union .\n\nFigure 1 indicates that in terms of household income, the gap between the twelve EU newcomers (CEE12; see list in note to Figure 1) and ten richer western and northern EU countries (EU10; see note to Figure 1) was and still is wider than the GDP per capita gap. I report these indicators at purchasing power standards, which corrects for cross-country differences in price levels. I compare CEE12 to EU10 and to the EU average, because the EU10 countries are the top performers to which convergence would be desirable. The EU average also includes southern European countries that faced various crises and economic weaknesses over the past fifteen years, and the CEE12 countries themselves.\n\nIn 2004, CEE12 GDP per capita was 43 percent of the EU10 level, but average household income was at only 34 percent. In 2023, the CEE12 reached 69 percent of EU10 GDP per capita and 62 percent of EU household income, which was an impressive pace in narrowing the income gap. Household income converged somewhat faster than GDP.\n\nHousehold income distribution\n\nHow have the incomes of the poorest, the middle class and the richest developed over the past two decades?\n\nTo answer this question, I divide society into 20 parts (ventiles in the statistical jargon). The first ventile (V1 in Figures 2 and 3) includes the poorest 5 percent of the population. The second ventile (V2) includes the next poorest 5 percent, and so on. The twentieth ventile (V20) includes the top 5 percent earners (see the annex for some data issues and methodological notes).\n\nFigure 2 shows that in 2004, the poorest 5 percent in the CEE12 possessed only 13 percent of the income of the poorest 5 percent in EU10 - well below the overall average of 34 percent reported in Figure 1. Yet the poorest CEE12 citizens benefitted from very fast income growth: by 2023, their income relative to the poorest 5 percent of EU10 increased to 54 percent . This is still below the 62 percent average reported in Figure 1, yet income growth was very fast.\n\nIn contrast, the top 5 percent in the CEE12 had a better relative position compared to the top 5 percent in EU10 in 2004 (41 percent), while the improvement from 2004-2023 was less impressive, with their relative share increasing to 59 percent, which is also below the 62 percent average reported in Figure 1.\n\nIt is the upper middle class (from ventiles 10 to 19) in the CEE12 who achieved a relative income position above the 62 percent average in 2023.\n\nReal income growth\n\nWhile Figures 1 and 2 expressed CEE12 household income as a percent of EU10 household income, it is instructive to show the total growth of real income from 2004-2023 (Figure 3).\n\nIn real terms, the incomes of the poorest 5 percent of CEE12 citizens were lifted by a staggering 256 percent in total from 2004 to 2023. That is, if income was \u20ac100 in 2004, it increased, in real terms, to \u20ac356 by 2023. This corresponds to a 6.8 percent average annual real income increase, well above the EU average annual of growth of just 0.7 percent. Figure 3 shows lower income growth rates for richer CEE12 people. Real income growth for the top 5 percent was the lowest among the twenty ventiles, though still high at 60 percent in total from 2004-2023, or 2.5 percent per year on average. Such inequality-reducing income growth developments in CEE12 are in contrast to the experience of the EU10, where the highest earners benefitted from the fastest income growth, even if its rate at 0.5 percent per year (in real terms) falls short of the CEE12 growth rate.\n\nLooking forward\n\nTwo decades ago, EU membership offered the CEE12 various opportunities to boost growth. For example, market institutions have been strengthened, improving the business environment and attracting investment from abroad, which has boosted the capital stock and productivity, and has improved corporate governance. Access to the single market has increased competition, fostering the efficiency of firms.\n\nMeanwhile, labour mobility resulted in an exodus from CEE12 to EU10 and the United Kingdom, which offered the opportunity to gain work experience in a more productive environment, upgrade skills and accumulate savings from higher incomes than at home. Such capital accumulation of CEE12 emigrants also supported their home countries in the form of remittances and investments in property and businesses back home. Access to high-quality education in other EU countries improved the human capital of CEE12 young people. All these effects supported the economies of CEE12 countries, even if many of those who left the CEE12 have not returned. Financial support from EU funds might have also supported growth.\n\nSuch beneficial effects, coupled with much lower wage levels in CEE12 than in EU10 and the geographical closeness of the region to EU10, were likely instrumental in the CEE12 economic successes over the past two decades.\n\nThe annual pace of catching up measured in terms of per-capita income remained broadly stable over the past two decades, despite the crises that some of these countries suffered during the global financial crisis, and the gradual increase in local labour costs, which reduces the attractiveness of these countries for labour-intensive investments. At an unchanged pace from the past two decades, both GDP per capita and household income would reach the EU10 level by about 2046. But is this realistic?\n\nThe key question is whether CEE12 economies can shift towards higher value-added activities as their relative wage levels increase. Some of the EU-enlargement-related productivity gains might be one-offs (ie it is easier to improve productivity from a low level, but more difficult from a higher level), while CEE12 economies already suffer from labour shortages, and the demographic outlook of these countries is even worse than in EU10. Innovation activities in the region are weaker than in EU10, as reflected in the European innovation scoreboard , which, in 2023, ranked five CEE12 countries in the worst of the four innovation performance categories, six other CEE12 countries in the second worst category, and only Cyprus making it into the second-best category. Secondary school education quality scores are mixed across the region, with five CEE12 (Estonia, Poland, Czechia, Slovenia and Latvia) having better scores than the OECD average in at least two of the three subjects considered (mathematics, reading and science). Two countries (Lithuania and Hungary) are close to the average, while the remaining five countries are below average. Most CEE12 universities are poorly ranked . Weak innovation and education performance might adversely affect longer-term growth prospects.\n\nTherefore, while there is a lot to celebrate, twenty years on from the EU's eastern enlargement, major challenges lie ahead to maintain the momentum of economic convergence.\n\nReferences\n\nBaas, T. and H.

But behind every moment of transformation lies a silent yet indispensable force - the supply chain. It is the unsung hero, the invisible backbone that supports and sustains the very fabric of change,\" he opined.\n\nMr. Frimpong stated that the industrial revolution, a seismic shift that ushered in an era of unprecedented progress and prosperity, was still hinged on the emergence of efficient supply chains connecting raw materials to factories and markets with unprecedented speed and scale.\n\nHe cited that similarly, the rise of the digital age has been made possible by intricate networks of supply chains enabling the seamless flow of information, goods, and services across the globe at the click of a button.\n\nHowever, Mr. Frimpong Barimah indicated that it's not just in grand historical moments that the supply chain has played a transformative role; in every industry worldwide, it serves as the lifeblood of economic activity, facilitating the creation, production, and distribution of goods and services that touch the lives of billions.\n\nHe noted that in recent years, global supply chains have come under immense pressure due to unprecedented trade turbulence, economic uncertainty, geopolitical events, and natural disasters.\n\nMr. Frimpong stated, \"Although the integration of African economies into global supply chains is relatively low compared with other regions, disruptions to supply chain operations have a more than proportionate adverse impact on our economies. This gives relevance to our theme for this year's summit - Africa's Supply Chain Resilience for Economic Transformation. We can only be resilient and drive the expected economic transformation through value addition.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Africa's export of few manufactured goods is an indication of our weak participation in supply chain trade. The 54 countries of Africa combined account for only 2.6 percent of global trade. This figure drops to 0.8 percent when only manufactured goods are considered (COMTRADE/UNSTAT 2023). The share of manufactured goods in total exports is only 34 percent (66% of exports are without value addition) for African countries, which is relatively low compared with 83 percent for East Asia, 74 percent for low- and middle-income countries excluding African countries, 68 percent for South Asia, 45 percent for Latin America, and 70 percent for the world average (UN COMTRADE 2023). Half of the manufactured products exported by the continent come from only three countries: South Africa (27 percent), Egypt (10 percent), and Morocco (10 percent).\n\n\"Thirteen countries out of 54 produce 81 percent of the manufactured exports. This concentration of export countries is even more pronounced when considering only fully transformed goods. Three countries (South Africa, 28 percent; Morocco, 15 percent; and Nigeria, 12 percent) sell 55 percent of fully transformed product exports.\n\n\"In sharp contrast with other regions of the world, especially the countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), African exports have so far not been connected to regional supply chains. Regional value chains only accounted for 2.7 percent of Africa's GVC participation in 2022, compared with 26.4 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean and 42.9 percent in developing Asia, often called 'factory Asia' to emphasize that supply chain trade remains within the region. Among the five AU regions, the participation rate is lowest for North Africa and highest for East Africa, at around 5 percent. This is why the AfCFTA has declared the development of RVCs a priority objective. The GVC participation indicators show that among Asian and Pacific countries (excluding high-income countries), the degree of regional integration was almost six times higher than in Africa in 2022, and the trend hasn't changed.\"\n\nEK", "source": {"uri": "ghanaweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GhanaWeb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain",

The drop in Germany's electricity production as well as in total energy consumption in early 2024 was in part caused by weaker economic development, warm weather, and high energy prices, said energy industry initiative AGEB earlier this week.", "source": {"uri": "cleanenergywire.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clean Energy Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Associations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

text-to-speech service, please first agree to the privacy policy below.\n\nTaipei, June 6 (CNA) The local consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.24 percent from a year earlier in May, above the 2-percent warning level the central bank set for inflation, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Thursday.\n\nData compiled by the DGBAS showed the CPI in May rose by more than 2 percent after a 1.94 percent increase in April.\n\nCentral bank governor Yang Chin-long (\u694a\u91d1\u9f8d) said earlier Thursday at a legislative committee meeting that the central bank's decision on whether to raise interest rates will hinge on inflation.\n\nMeanwhile, core CPI, which excludes vegetables, fruit and energy, moved 1.84 percent higher in May, the DGBAS said.\n\nThe rise in May CPI was mainly driven by rising vegetable and fruit prices due to adverse weather conditions and increasing egg prices, DGBAS specialist Tsao Chih-hung (\u66f9\u5fd7\u5f18) said at a press conference.\n\nIn May, food prices rose 3.43 percent from a year earlier, with the prices of vegetables and fruit up 11.75 percent and 8.66 percent, respectively, according to the DGBAS data.\n\nAlso of note, rent rose 2.6 percent from a year ago, marking the largest monthly growth in 28 years, Tsao said, adding that since July 2022, the average annual increase in the rent index has exceeded 2 percent and remained at that level.\n\nTsao attributed soaring rent prices to spiking consumer prices, rising property maintenance costs, as well as higher interest rates and increasing housing prices.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of dining out in May was up 2.79 percent year-on-year, the lowest in 29 months, due to the high comparison base last year but up 0.27 percent from April, Tsao said.\n\nMore expensive medical costs also drove up the May CPI, according to DGBAS.\n\nIn May, medical costs rose 3.45 percent from a year earlier because of higher registration fees required by some clinics as well as an increase in payments by patients under the National Health Insurance scheme, the DGBAS said.\n\nLooking to June, Tsao said CPI growth could be stronger owing to vegetable and fruit price fluctuations caused by recent rainy days, but if vegetables and fruit are excluded, other consumer prices are expected to be relatively stable, with an increase of about 1 percent.",

On May 29, futures markets were pricing in a 21 percent chance that the Fed would stick to its \"higher for longer\" rate strategy and not implement any rate cuts this year.\n\nBets placed by futures market investors as of Wednesday implied that the odds of three or more rate cuts by Dec. 18 are 25 percent, up from 7 percent on May 29. The CME FedWatch Tool predicts there's a 66 percent chance of two or more rate cuts by the end of the year, up from 36 percent on May 29.\n\nWhile the recent decline in mortgage rates has been dramatic, it remains to be seen how much of an incentive the pullback will provide to would-be homebuyers.\n\nA weekly survey of lenders by the Mortgage Bankers Association found that for the week

This gives relevance to our theme for this year's summit - Africa's Supply Chain Resilience for Economic Transformation. We can only be resilient to drive the expected Economic Transformation through value addition\".\n\nAgain, he narrated that \"Africa's export of few manufactured goods is an indication of our weak participation in supply chain trade. The 54 countries of Africa combined account for only 2.6 percent of global trade. This figure drops to 0.8 percent when only manufactured goods are considered (COMTRADE/UNSTAT 2023).\n\nThe share of manufactured goods in total exports is only 34 percent (66% of exports are without value addition) for African countries, which is relatively low compared with 83 percent for East Asia, 74 percent for low- and middle-income countries excluding African countries, 68 percent for South Asia, 45 percent for Latin America, and 70 percent for the world average (UN COMTRADE 2023). Half of the manufactured products exported by the continent come from only three countries: South Africa (27 percent), Egypt (10 percent), and Morocco (10 percent). Thirteen countries out of 54 produce 81 percent of the manufactured exports.\n\nThis concentration of export countries is even more pronounced when considering only fully transformed goods. Three countries (South Africa, 28 percent; Morocco, 15 percent; and Nigeria, 12 percent) sell 55 percent of fully transformed product exports. In sharp contrast with other regions of the world, especially the countries that comprise the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), African exports have so far not been connected to regional supply chains. Regional value chains only accounted for 2.7 percent of Africa's GVC participation in 2022, compared with 26.4 percent for Latin America and the Caribbean and 42.9 percent in developing Asia, often called 'factory Asia' to emphasize that supply chain trade remains within the region.\n\nAmong the five AU regions, the participation rate is lowest for North Africa and highest for East Africa, at around 5 percent. This is why the AfCFTA has declared the development of RVCs a priority objective.\n\nThe GVC participation indicators show that among Asian and Pacific countries (excluding high-income countries), the degree of regional integration was almost six times higher than in Africa in 2022, and the trend hasn't change\".", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"},

LGBTQ+ young people in the South reported the highest rates of worrying about a mass shooting (90 percent), followed by those in the Midwest (88 percent), West (87 percent), and Northeast (85 percent).\n\nLGBTQ+ youth who reported being impacted or knowing someone impacted by a mass shooting also reported higher rates of having seriously considered suicide in the past year (45 percent), and attempting suicide (16 percent).\n\nDerrick Matthews, Director of Research Science at The Trevor Project, said that \"Pride Month should be a time for all LGBTQ+ people to celebrate our community freely, unapologetically and safely. However, these new data suggest that in the midst of these celebrations, a number of LGBTQ+ young people may also be worried about mass shootings.\"\n\n\"While harrowing, these data serve as a call to action to invest in more research on the impact that mass shootings and firearms have on LGBTQ+ young people,\" he continued. \"Better understanding and addressing the connections between firearms, mass shootings, and mental health will better allow LGBTQ+ young people to experience the queer joy they deserve not only during Pride Month, but all year long.\"", "source": {"uri": "advocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gay News, LGBT Rights, Politics, Entertainment"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everytown_for_Gun_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Everytown for Gun Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trevor_Project", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Trevor Project"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_nightclub_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando nightclub shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pride Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition_Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Competition Shooting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Education", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Shooting", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://www.advocate.com/media-library/rifles-gun-store-racks-display-cases.jpg?id=52424541&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C78", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9625589", "eventUri": "eng-9625589", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

It was also higher than 12.9 percent registered in April 2023, equivalent to 833,000 more underemployed individuals due to the higher number of invisibly underemployed.\n\nThe National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said the government remains committed to creating more high-quality jobs by investing in human capital, reinvigorating industry and priority sectors and pushing for massive infrastructure development, according to\n\nData show that the labor force participation rate (LFPR) went down to 64.1 percent in April from 65.1 percent a year ago.

This is expected to further encourage investments and job creation in the country.\n\nThe government is proactively improving the investment landscape to sustain labor market gains.

It aims to address unemployment, underemployment, informal working arrangements, and other labor market challenges,\" said Balisacan.\n\nBalisacan said the TBP Plan focuses on enhancing the employability and competitiveness of Filipino workers through upskilling and reskilling initiatives. Support for micro, small, and medium enterprises and industry stakeholders is also integral to the plan, he said.\n\n\"The government aims to assist Filipino workers in the digital age. Initiatives include reducing job search duration, upskilling the workforce, and facilitating the transition towards higher-income jobs.

As a result, the hedge fund headed by Dan Loeb is up 10.5 percent over the first five months of 2024, according to its May monthly report, seen by Institutional Investor. For comparison, the S&P 500 rose 5 percent in May and 11.3 percent for the year, including dividends reinvested.\n\nThe multistrategy hedge fund's equity strategy led the way last month, kicking in 5.2 percent to net returns. The long book accounted for a 6.9 percent increase, but the short book detracted from performance by 1.7 percent. Most of the gains were generated by the fundamental and event-driven book.\n\nMost of Third Point's non-equity strategies also were profitable or broke even, led by credit, which added 0.30 percent to May performance. Equities also accounted for most of the year-to-date gains.\n\nThird Point's biggest winner this year is energy company Vistra Corp., which led in May as well as year-to-date. The stock was up about 30 percent last month alone and approximately 157 percent this year through May. This, stunningly, is even better than Nvidia's performance over the same five-month period. On March 1, Vistra completed the acquisition of Energy Harbor, boosting its retail electricity business.\n\nThird Point's other top performers in May were utility Pacific Gas and Electric, consumer goods company Bath & Body Works, investment bank UBS, and cloud computing giant Microsoft. Other winners for the year so far are e-commerce giant Amazon, Microsoft, Bath & Body Works, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Third Point expanded its stake in Amazon by more than 21 percent in the first quarter, according to the most recent 13F filing.\n\nThe firm's biggest losers in May were Corpay, a business payments and spend management company, and four different undisclosed short positions. For the year, the biggest losers were chemicals giant DuPont, health care insurance giant Humana, chip company Marvell Technology, and two different undisclosed short positions. Third Point fully liquidated its stake in DuPont in the first quarter, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nHeading into June, Third Point turned even more bullish, boosting net long exposure in its equities strategy to nearly 87 percent from 77 percent the previous month. Virtually all of the difference is thanks to an increase in the firm's long exposure. Its five biggest long positions are unchanged: PG&E, Amazon, Microsoft, Bath & Body Works, and Meta.\n\nIn the first quarter, Third Point also established a new, three million-share position in Google parent Alphabet, making it the firm's seventh-largest U.S. common stock long position, per a regulatory filing.", "source": {"uri": "institutionalinvestor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Institutional Investor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Point_Management", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Third Point Management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hedge fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistra_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vistra Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_Investor_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Institutional Investor (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_S._Loeb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daniel S.

Known for his receiving skills, Johnson rushed for 2,265 yards and caught 2,870 yards in his career. Johnson signed with the Bills in 2022 but had limited impact.\n\nAfter eight seasons in the NFL, former Cleveland Browns running back Duke Johnson has called it a career, per his Instagram.\n\nJohnson was drafted No. 77 overall in the 2015 NFL Draft out of Miami (FL) and played from 2015 through 2022 in a career that saw him suiting up for five different franchises. In addition to the Browns, Johnson also played for the Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, Miami Dolphins, and Buffalo Bills. He last played in the NFL in 2022 for the Bills, where he appeared in one game.\n\nRelated Matt Ryan Retires From the NFL After Signing One-Day Contract With Falcons The 38-year-old long-time NFL quarterback has officially retired with the same team that drafted him in 2008. Johnson Calls it a Career The RB finished his NFL career with 2,265 rushing yards and 2,870 receiving yards\n\nIn his first season in the NFL with the Browns, Johnson played in 16 games, had 104 carries for 379 yards, and added 61 receptions on 74 targets and two touchdowns through the air. Throughout his NFL career, Johnson would be known more as a pass-catching threat rather than for his ability to take carries out of the backfield.\n\nThroughout his time in Cleveland, Johnson amassed 299 carries for 1,286 yards and five touchdowns. In the passing game, he caught 235 balls on 303 targets for 2,170 yards and eight touchdowns. His best day catching the ball in his career came with the Browns on November 4, 2018, where he had nine targets, caught all of them, and went for 78 yards and two touchdowns against the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nDuke Johnson Career Stats\n\nYear\n\nTeam\n\nRushing Yards\n\nRushing TDs\n\nReceiving Yards\n\nReceiving TDs\n\n2015\n\nCLE\n\n379\n\n0\n\n534\n\n2\n\n2016\n\nCLE\n\n358\n\n1\n\n514\n\n0\n\n2017\n\nCLE\n\n348\n\n4\n\n693\n\n3\n\n2018\n\nCLE\n\n201\n\n0\n\n429\n\n3\n\n2019\n\nHOU\n\n410\n\n2\n\n410\n\n3\n\n2020\n\nHOU\n\n235\n\n1\n\n249\n\n1\n\n2021\n\nMIA\n\n330\n\n3\n\n41\n\n0\n\n2022\n\nBUF\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nIn the offseason before the 2019 season, Johnson was traded to the Texans for a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2020 draft that would become a third-round pick. He was active on the Texans roster for 10 games over the course of two seasons in Houston, playing in 32 games, starting four, and rushing for 645 yards on 160 carries and three touchdowns. He also caught 72 passes on 97 targets for 659 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, he was released by the Texans. The Jacksonville Jaguars signed Johnson to their practice squad on September 6, 2021, but he lasted just 10 days.\n\nA little more than a month later, on October 26, 2021, Johnson was signed to the Dolphins' practice squad. He was elevated to the active roster soon after, and during his time with the Dolphins, he had his two-best single-game rushing performances ever, going for 117 yards and a touchdown on January 9, 2022, against the New England Patriots. A few weeks before that, on December 19, 2021, Johnson rushed for 107 yards and two scores against the New York Jets.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: With 3,519 rushing yards in college, Duke Johnson still holds the title of all-time leading rusher for the Miami Hurricanes.\n\nThese were the only two occasions in which Johnson rushed for over 100 yards rushing, and his two-touchdown game was the only time he had multiple rushing scores in a single game.\n\nJohnson finished his time with the Dolphins rushing for 330 yards on 71 carries with three touchdowns. He wasn't much of a factor in the receiving game, catching just four passes on five targets for 41 yards.\n\nA free agent, Johnson signed with the Bills on a one-year deal in March 2022. He was released before the season on August 30 but was immediately added to the practice squad. He appeared in just one game for them.\n\nNow 30 years old, Johnson won the ACC Brian Piccolo Award during his time in college. A five-star recruit, he also earned First-Team All-ACC honors in 2014, was the ACC Rookie of the Year, ACC Offensive Rookie of the Year, and a two-time Second-Team All-ACC recipient.\n\nSource: Duke Johnson on Instagram\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated Darren Waller Still Hasn't 'Made A Decision Yet' About Retiring The man with the largest tight end contract in NFL history is still unsure whether he'll be suiting up in 2024 or hanging up his cleats.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duke Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ryan_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Ryan (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Hurricanes_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Hurricanes football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Texans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Waller", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darren Waller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference_football_individual_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference football individual awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Coast_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Coast Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-06-may-2024-02-51-pm-678.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541254", "eventUri": "eng-9541254", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-04", "textStart": 1814, "textEnd": 1830}, {"amb": false, "date": "-08-30", "textStart": 3975, "textEnd": 3984}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-12-", "textStart": 3230, "textEnd": 3241}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He left Coral Gables as the Hurricanes' all-time rushing leader.\n\nOver four seasons with the Browns, Johnson appeared in 64 games, starting 10. He rushed for 1,286 yards on 299 carries with five rushing touchdowns in Cleveland.\n\nJohnson had a career-high 104 carries as a rookie in 2015 for 379 yards, which was his best rushing total with the Browns. He finished his career with 532 carries for 2,265 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nJohnson was also an effective receiver out of the backfield. He had 2,170 receiving yards and eight receiving touchdowns on 235 catches with the Browns.\n\nThat manifested itself in 2017, when he had 74 catches for 693 yards and three touchdown. Johnson finished his career with 311 catches for 2,870 yards and 12 touchdowns.\n\nJohnson agreed to a three-year contract extension with the Browns in June, 2018. However, he was traded to the Houston Texans during training camp in 2019 after a dispute with the team for a conditional 2020 fourth-round pick that became a third-rounder after he appeared in all 16 games for the Texans that season, rushing for a career-best 410 yards.\n\nJohnson spent two seasons with the Texans before being released in February, 2021.

Johnson was selected out of the University of Miami in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns.\n\nThroughout his eight-year NFL career, Johnson mostly served as a change-of-pace back utilized heavily in the receiving game. In four years with the Browns, Johnson played in all 16 games each season, totaling 1,286 rushing yards along with 235 receptions for 2,170 yards. One of the best games of Johnson's career came against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 2017 regular-season finale. Johnson rushed for 20 yards and a touchdown, while adding 6 catches for 75 yards. His stellar performance was overshadowed by the Browns losing the game against the Steelers' backups and finishing with just the second 0-16 season in NFL history.\n\nIn 2017, Johnson joined illustrious company when he became the first running back to finish with at least 500 receiving yards in each of his first three seasons since the great Herschel Walker did it from 1986-88.\n\nThe veteran back struggled to find his footing the last few years, jumping from the Houston Texans to the Miami Dolphins and finally the Buffalo Bills, before being released by the Bills in January 2023.\n\nAlthough he didn't ever reach true RB1 status on any NFL team, Johnson was fantastic as a third-down option for five years, and his college career was exceptional. Johnson is the Miami Hurricanes' all-time leading rusher, an impressive feat at a school with a storied history.\n\nJohnson turned 30 years old last fall, and according to his Instagram, he's officially stepping into the next chapter of his life beyond the NFL.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Duke Johnson (@dukejohnson__)\n\nRelated Items:Cleveland Browns, Duke Johnson Recommended for you Ranking The Rooms: AFC North QBs Browns Believe They Have Another Pass Rush Win Rate Producer In Mike Hall Jr. 'Nobody Wants To Bet Against Batman:' Browns Confident RB Nick Chubb Will Recover", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_j_kurcina@steelersdepot.com", "name": "John J.

Johnson announced his retirement after eight seasons in the league on May 5.\n\nJohnson was originally drafted in the third round by the Cleveland Browns in the 2015 NFL Draft. He played his college ball at the University of Miami, becoming a star with the Hurricanes. His best season with the Hurricanes came in 2014 when he posted 1,652 yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nHe finished his three-year college career with 3,519 rushing yards and 26 touchdowns while catching 69 passes for 719 yards and 4.0 touchdowns. Johnson decided to forgo his senior season to pursue his career in the NFL.\n\nOnce he was drafted by the Browns, the future was looking bright for the running back. However, injuries started to take their toll very quickly in his career. He injured his hamstring on the first day of the Browns' training camp, missing the first preseason game. Once he was finally able to get back onto the field, he suffered a concussion and was taken out of the game.\n\nJohnson was eventually named the backup running back for Cleveland behind Isaiah Crowell, giving him a chance to earn his keep. In his first-ever NFL game, Johnson rushed for 22 yards on seven carries. His rookie season never materialized much success as he finished the year rushing for 379 yards on 104 attempts.\n\nHis next few seasons in Cleveland were more of the same, with his rookie year being the more productive with the Browns. Johnson was eventually traded to the Houston Texans for a conditional draft pick in 2019. His first year with Houston was the most impactful of his career. He rushed for 410 yards and two touchdowns over 16 games played.\n\nJohnson spent two seasons in Houston before being released in 2021. He signed onto the Jacksonville Jaguars practice squad shortly after but was released only a few weeks later.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins took a chance on Johnson following his release from Jacksonville, but his time in South Beach was short. He appeared in just five games for them, posting 330 yards and three touchdowns. The final act of Johnson's career came with the Buffalo Bills, where he appeared in one game, rushing for four yards on two attempts.\n\nHe hasn't played in the NFL since being let go by Buffalo and is now calling it quits. His career never took off like many believed it could, but he still played longer than many others. Johnson's career numbers came in at 2265 rushing yards with 11 touchdowns.

Johnson didn't play last season and was most recently with the Bills.\n\n\"8 Years 4 teams with 1 goal in mind, create a better life for my family,\" Johnson wrote on Instagram. \"I never dreamed of being the all time leading rusher of my dream school or being somewhere on the list of all time players to come out of South FL. I just wanted an opportunity to play a game to provide a better life for my family and I was able to do just that.\"\n\nThe Browns selected Johnson No. 77 overall in the 2015 draft after he rushed for 3,519 yards at the University of Miami, a school record that still stands.\n\nOver four seasons with the Browns, he rushed for 1,286 yards and had 2,170 receiving yards and scored 13 touchdowns and played in all 16 games every season.\n\nOne of the few skill position players Browns fans embraced during a 1-31 stretch in 2016 and 2017, Johnson had his best season in 2017 when he had 1,041 scrimmage yards and scored seven touchdowns. He was awarded the local PFWA player of the year award and earned a three-year contract extension.\n\nHe struggled to find his role at times and, in a 2018 interview with cleveland.com, admitted he lobbied his head coach, Hue Jackson, to play wide receiver.\n\nHis relationship with the Browns eventually soured, coming to a head after the Browns added Kareem Hunt to the running back room behind Nick Chubb and Johnson requested a trade in 2019. Quarterback Baker Mayfield called Johnson out that spring, saying, \"You're either on this train or you're not, it's moving. You can get out of the way or you can join us. so it is what it is.\"\n\nJohnson was traded to the Texans in August for a 2020 draft pick they used on linebacker Jacob Phillips.\n\nHe spent two seasons in Houston playing with current Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson. He rushed for 645 yards and had 659 receiving yards in 27 games before adding stops in Miami in 2021 and Buffalo in 2022, appearing in just six games over two seasons.\n\nThe 30-year old Johnson ends his career with 2,265 rushing yards, 2,870 receiving yards and 23 total touchdowns.\n\n\"I hope I left a greater impression on y'all that's bigger than football,\" Johnson wrote.", "source": {"uri": "cleveland.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cleveland"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Miami", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kareem Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Chubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Chubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deshaun_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deshaun Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hue Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baker Mayfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/H4RH44YIUVA7TGFCDWK22LYYPU.JPG?auth=d56337d2ceaa287dc667cfe65e7b2756d333f1f68c461619eaca1d174e0f12b7&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541254", "eventUri": "eng-9541254", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Johnson wrote, \"8 Years 4 teams with 1 goal in mind, create a better life for my family.\"\n\nThe Miami alum \"never dreamed of being the all time leading rusher of my dream school or being somewhere on the list of all time players to come out of South FL. I just wanted an opportunity to play a game to provide a better life for my family and I was able to do just that. I want to thank each team for giving me the chance to play and represent your organization and all the fans that supported me through the highs and lows.\"\n\nJohnson gave a shout to \"all my vets\" who showed him the \"ropes free of charge,\" and the \"little bros who trusted\" him as a mentor. \"To all my coaches that I love, y'all know who y'all are, THANK YOU. From the bottom of my heart I'm so grateful for each and every one of y'all.\n\n\"Last but DEFINITELY NOT LEAST, I want to thank my GOD for allowing me to take this journey and end it in the same health I started it in. With that being said I'm officially retiring from the NFL. I hope I left a greater impression on y'all that's bigger than football. To my wife and Son, all of this was for y'all.\"\n\nJohnson played with the Miami Dolphins before signing with the Bills in 2022. In five games in Miami, he recorded 71 rushes for 330 yards and 3 touchdowns, along with 4 receptions for 41 yards.\n\nAfter landing in Buffalo, Johnson appeared to be a strong candidate to make the 53-man roster. Through three preseason games, he registered 21 carries for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns while also returning punts and kickoffs. However, he faced tough competition with former Bills running Zack Moss and then-rookie James Cook. After cutting Johnson, the Bills signed the veteran to the practice squad the next day.\n\nThe Bills elevated Johnson to the active for one game, during which he registered 2 carries for four yards. While the San Francisco 49ers invited him for a workout ahead of the 2023 NFL season, he remained unsigned last year. Johnson finished his NFL career with 532 rushes for 2,265 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also recorded 311 receptions for 2,870 yards and 12 scores.\n\nCook appears to be hitting his stride as a pass-catching running back and is set to Buffalo's RB1. The Bills drafted Ray Davis in the fourth round of the 2024 NFL draft, who could make an immediate impact. The Bills did not re-sign Leonard Fournette or Latavius Murray.\n\nThe Athletic's Joe Buscaglia wrote, \"After bouncing back from being benched, Cook enters his third season as the unquestioned lead back on the roster.\"\n\n\"[Ty] Johnson returned on a one-year deal and provided spark. His game is more like Cook's, so he'll likely have a game day role when Cook needs a breather. The Bills hope Davis [sic] brings what they've wanted to add to the group for years -- power and short-yardage ability. It's unclear how significant Davis' role will be, but there's a world where he jumps Johnson on the depth chart before the season begins.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_bicks@heavy.com", "name": "Emily Bicks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Duke Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zack_Moss", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zack Moss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_squad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latavius_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latavius Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Fournette", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leonard Fournette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Depth chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1418327513-e1714932824565.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541254", "eventUri": "eng-9541254", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 339, "textEnd": 344}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

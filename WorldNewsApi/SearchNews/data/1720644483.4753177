'It feels like we\u2019re at a p", "text": "When Angela Frank opened an old-fashioned candy store in Imperial Beach in 2013, she didn\u2019t realize it would become a cherished hang-out spot for many. Seaside Candy on Palm Avenue, just feet from the beach, was where veterans gathered for coffee in the mornings, students stopped by on their way home from school and families bought desserts after dinner. \u201cThis was a labor of love,\u201d said Frank, who traded her full-time job in real estate for the candy shop that originally was intended to be a fun, side project. Her recent vision was to expand the business by opening an arcade. But she let that dream go. The candy shop shut down in late May because of a significant decline in revenue, which Frank attributed to the more than 900 consecutive days of beach closures due to high bacteria levels in the water near where pollution flushes through the Tijuana River into South Bay. \u201cSales were doing so good for many years, even right after COVID,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got to hire more people. But last summer, when (the county) really started doing the closures at the beach, I would say our business dropped over 60 percent.\u201d A San Diego County report published earlier this year evaluating the economic impacts of the cross-border sewage crisis shows that Seaside Candy\u2019s experience is not an anomaly. One year ago, the county Board of Supervisors asked staff to find out how badly the worsening cross-border pollution has affected South County\u2019s economy. Five departments took on the effort: the Office of Emergency Services, the Parks and Recreation Department, the Office of Economic Development and Government Affairs, the Department of Environmental Health and Quality and the County Communications Office. From August to September 2023, they gathered information through a small-business survey. The report was first shared with the board in a January memo and published in a long list of communications that was part of a February board agenda. There has been no public presentation of the findings. A total of 63 businesses responded to the survey, indicating that more than 70 percent are affected by the sewage crisis. The study did not show which communities the businesses were from. Regarding revenue, 66 percent of participants reported a decrease due to beach closures. Several said they lost at least $100,000 in earnings in the last year. They also had to lay off employees. When asked about the future should the cross-border issue not improve, most businesses said they would have trouble keeping their doors open, and several reported they plan on relocating or shutting down, according to the report. Among them was Coronado Brewing Company, which laid off nearly 30 employees and shut down late last year after nearly a decade on Seacoast Drive, an area bursting with business promise during those years. But according to the report, the business said its closure was a direct result of the sewage crisis. A survey respondent said their business of almost 30 years of renting and selling items used at the beach, such as surfboards, wetsuits and towels, lost $30,000 over the past 8 months. \u201cI can\u2019t rent these items nor sell them with the ocean closed,\u201d read their response. Access to the beach is a significant economic driver for coastal cities across San Diego County, especially small jurisdictions such as Imperial Beach and Coronado. Tourists spent nearly $14 billion in the region in 2022, with many going to the beaches, according to a recent report by the San Diego Tourism Authority. Marty Mattis, president of the Imperial Beach Chamber of Commerce, said vacation rentals and government contracts for mid-term rentals are also down \u201csince the (magnifying) glass has been put on the sewage crisis.\u201d Additionally, horse riding businesses and farmers in the Tijuana River Valley have reported declining business. Organizations that offer recreational activities have had to reduce programming or offer them elsewhere. And many beloved community events, including surf competitions, that drew hundreds of people annually to South County beaches have been canceled. Without clean water, fewer people are stopping by and investing in local businesses, many of which are mom-and-pop shops. \u201cIf there is a continued reduction in tourism due to beach water closures, there will be a corresponding reduction in profitable and operating businesses, which will result in lost wages for employees and lost revenue for business owners,\u201d the county study said. Imperial Beach\u2019s shorelines have been off-limits since December 2021 and portions of Coronado\u2019s beaches are sometimes shut down due to elevated bacterial levels, according to the county\u2019s DNA-based water quality testing. The main culprit is a defunct wastewater facility along the coast in Baja California, about 6 miles south of the border, that spews about 35 million gallons of raw sewage a day into the Pacific Ocean. Mexico says it will have the plant replaced and operating by this fall. However, it\u2019s unclear how soon businesses and residents, many of whom reportedly have gotten sick from the pollution, will start to feel relief. For Don Fallon, who worked at Seaside Candy, a solution to the sewage problem did not come soon enough. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re at a point of no return if this doesn't get resolved fast,\u201d he said, looking at the piles of packed candy as the business closed down during the last week of May. \u201cIt\u2019s sad. We saw generations come in. Kids who are grown up now and would bring in their kids.\u201d Just down Palm Avenue is Mattis\u2019 business, the Ye Olde Plank Inn, a beachfront bar. \u201cI remember when you couldn\u2019t find a single parking space and now, I can park right in front,\u201d he said. \u201cThe sentiment around businesses is, \u2018Who\u2019s going next?\u2019\u201d Mattis and other local businesses in Imperial Beach want to change that. They want officials to launch a marketing campaign that promotes the city and its businesses. And they want their state and federal officials to provide business grants or loans akin to the COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program to help them stay open. \u201cThere\u2019s more than the beach. Come down here,\u201d said Mattis. \u201cThe beach may be closed, but the businesses aren\u2019t.\u201d Paloma Aguirre, who has long worked to tackle the crisis as an activist and now as mayor of Imperial Beach, agrees with Mattis. She said she plans to work with the Chamber of Commerce to better understand the impacts as other factors may also be affecting a downturn in business, and how they can promote their city. There are several questions Imperial Beach does not have answers to, such as how much property tax and investment has been lost and how many underused or vacant lands could have been developed if not for water quality impacts, said City Manager Tyler Foltz. \"Unfortunately, even though the city took many steps over the last 20 years to maintain and enhance economic vitality and quality of life, state and federal agencies did not do the same and the water quality continues to degrade with severe impacts to surrounding communities such as Imperial Beach,\" he said. Council members pointed out that new businesses are opening in Imperial Beach, as well as mixed-use developments. Food truck vendor Bonehead Burger, for example, will replace Seaside Candy to open a dine-in spot. The county report concluded that a \u201cfull scope of economic impacts resulting from the transboundary pollution is difficult to quantify without a dedicated study.\u201d It also mentioned that staff is working to identify funding streams and grant opportunities that could be used as short-term relief for businesses. None have been identified to date, but efforts continue, the county said. Last week, the Board of Supervisors approved purchasing air purifiers for families and businesses affected by noxious, sewage odors. San Diego leaders are renewing calls to the state and federal governments to declare the sewage crisis an emergency. \u201cThis pollution and subsequent beach closures have had a serious impact on our local businesses,\" Rep. Juan Vargas, D-San Diego, said in a statement. \"While our San Diego Congressional delegation has brought home hundreds of millions in federal funding to help address this issue, we still need all hands on deck. I\u2019ve called on the President to declare a Federal State of Emergency to unlock badly needed assistance for South Bay businesses and residents.\"", "summary": "Local businesses, most of them mom-and-pop shops, say they want officials to help promote the community, solicit grant funding", "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/story/2024-06-08/county-report-hints-at-economic-impact-sewage-crisis-has-on-south-bay-businesses-it-feels-like-were-at-a-point-of-no-return", "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f12c3a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+198/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2F9c%2Ffa0a07144c659adde695b53d5fdb%2Fsut-l-1454740-sewage", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:00:46", "author": "Tammy Murga", "authors": ["Tammy Murga"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.036}

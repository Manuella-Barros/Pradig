Police say the car fell off the parking garage and landed in an alley, hitting another car down below.\n\n\"The police officer said he saw the video and he said, 'luckily you were moving forward or else it would have landed right on top of you,'\" said William Burch, who was driving his SUV in the alley below the parking garage. Burch was about to park and inspect a nearby construction project he's managing when he heard commotion up above.\n\n\"My window was down and I heard something really loud and abnormal, so I just started driving forward and the vehicle landed on the backside of the Tahoe,\" Burch said.\n\nBurch was uninjured. The driver of the other car is hospitalized but expected to be okay.\n\n\"The retention cables didn't hold. The car went off the building, bounced off 515 Congress Avenue, fell and landed on a car that was going northbound in the alleyway before it hit the street,\" says Austin Police Department Cpl. Christopher Carlisle.\n\nIn September, another driver narrowly escaped injury in a similar scenario, but that time the garage's cables wrapped around the car's front axle -- dangling it in the air as the driver climbed out of the sunroof to safety.\n\nAccording to the Austin Code Department, the garage has had three violations since 2014. Two violations involved the elevator and the third came after the retention cables were broken in the September incident.\n\n\"I'm not a structural engineer. I don't design buildings, but there seems to be something, a flaw,\" says Carlisle.\n\nCode enforcement went back out to the garage Thursday to put up security fences since the 7th floor retention cables are still broken. They said they would likely urge the property manager to replace the cables with concrete barriers as long as the garage can structurally support that additional weight.\n\nCode's Robert Moore said this time the cables stretched. He said they did not find any deficiencies in the cables, except for the fact that they allowed a car to go through.\n\nAccording to city code, a parking garage barrier \"vehicle barriers for passenger vehicles shall be designed to resist a concentrated load of 6,000 pounds.\" It does not specify what kind of barrier that should be.\n\nIn the last incident, code worked with the owner to install a new barrier and make sure it's safe. Moore said this time they'll work with the owner again.\n\n\"We'll be keeping an eye on it, monitoring it until it's brought up back to code until it's safe again,\" Moore said.\n\nMoore said they did not inspect other cable barriers on other floors after the first incident. He also said they do not inspect cable barriers on other parking garages throughout the city unless someone calls with a complaint.\n\n\"We don't proactively go around looking at garages and anything in the city, I mean there's probably a bunch of stuff we don't know about but that's why we urge our citizens to call it in so we can go out there and check it out,\" Moore said.\n\nThe owner of the parking garage released the following statement:\n\nWe regret the unfortunate accident that happened today in our garage and are thankful that no lives were lost.\n\nA similar incident happened in September 2016 in the same garage, but on a different floor.\n\nThis morning, the car apparently hit the barriers at a rate of speed sufficient to break-through and hit the building across the alley.\n\nThe garage was built in 1979, and these are the only two such incidents since its construction 38 years ago.\n\nAfter the previous incident, we engaged a structural engineer to review the situation, and repairs to the safety barriers were performed according to his recommendation.\n\nThe City of Austin permitted and inspected such repairs to their satisfaction.\n\nPremier Parking, the manager of the parking garage, manages over 400 parking locations across the United States, and they have not experienced anything like this in their 15-year history other than the previous incident.\n\nAlthough all the facts of this accident are still being gathered, we will work to ensure the safety of our parking guests.", "timeCrawl": "23:48:00", "sim": 0.8313725590705872, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 112, "date": "2017-07-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 121}, {"date": "2016-09-", "textStart": 3467, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3481}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-10", "id": "8507760", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks", "id": 234, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "id": 235, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "id": 367, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "id": 419, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "id": 468, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "id": 1357, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Wiring_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Wiring and Accessories", "id": 1555, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The BMW then comes to rest on its roof, as nearby construction workers and bystanders come to the aid of the driver.\n\nPolice said the woman driving the BMW, who had serious injuries from the crash, mistook the gas pedal for the brakes and crashed through the parking garage barriers.\n\nBurch was uninjured. He was on the phone with his mother when the BMW landed on his car. \"I can just imagine what she was thinking when I had said, 'a car just landed on me, I gotta go.'\"\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2016, a 24-year-old man crashed through the barriers on the top level of the same parking garage. One of the barrier wires caught his SUV as it was falling and left his vehicle hanging precariously on the side of the garage.\n\nThe driver was able to escape with the help of a bystander.\n\nThe owner of the Littlefield Garage, located at 508 Brazos St., said these were the only two incidents of this kind they've experienced. KXAN reported the Austin Code Department issued the property a violation on Sept. 14, 2016, citing unsafe conditions, specifically unsafe barrier cable systems.\n\nAfter meeting with Austin Code, parking garage owner GTT Parking LP is making changes to improve safety, including looking into redesigning the entire cable system. Until then, temporary safeguards are in place on every level of the garage -- plastic barriers filled with water that act as an extra buffer between cars and those cables.\n\n\"It is a little scary that it got two hurt. Two accidents,\" Daniel Schuster told WISH-TV's sister station KXAN. It's something he says he can't help but think about as he pulls into the garage.\n\nAt first, he didn't know what to make of the first incident last September.\n\n\"It kind of seemed like a fluke thing. I was coming into the office and I heard on the radio to avoid the intersection, the car had gone off a garage,\" he said. But lightning struck twice. \"The cables, I mean after seeing two cars go through you just kind of get nervous. You don't want to hit the gas too hard, go off the edge.\"\n\nThe seventh floor, where the July incident happened, is currently fenced off with caution tape. Austin Code says its made several visits to the site with the property owner's representative, engineer, building official and city engineer. It was during those meetings the city determined the entire cable system will need to be brought up to current code.\n\nA woman KXAN spoke with who uses the parking garage said, \"Good to know they're looking at a redesign and we need that. And I'm glad the barriers are in place, so at least we're aware of what's happening.\"\n\nAustin Code reports the property owner has been in contact with several engineering firms to perform the repairs and upgrades, with several proposals received last week. The city says since the deadline to get the garage into code compliance is later this month, the owner will need to file an extension, to accommodate the redesign.\n\nNever miss another Facebook post from WISH-TV", "timeCrawl": "13:20:00", "sim": 0.8196078538894653, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 528, "date": "2017-07-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 535}, {"date": "2016-09-09", "textStart": 1014, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1027}, {"date": "2016-09-14", "textStart": 1523, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1537}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States of America"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8622866", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Electronics", "id": 197, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "id": 415, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "id": 419, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "id": 461, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "id": 468, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "id": 964, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "id": 1357, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Wiring_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Wiring and Accessories", "id": 1555, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

The incident took place in Austin, and it is believed that the woman in the car stepped on the gas instead of the brake, causing her BMW to fall seven stories below, clipping the back of a Chevrolet Tahoe that had just driven past the spot where she landed. The below video shows the SUV driving in the alley between Fifth and Sixth Street, near Sixth Street and Brazos Street, at approximately 8:28 a.m. on July 13.\n\nThe woman driving the car that fell was woman seriously injured. Surprisingly, it is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the downtown Austin parking garage. According to KVUE, the woman drove her car over the edge of the seventh floor almost one month ago, but the shocking video of the incident has just been released. According to the Austin-Travis County EMS and Austin police, the woman's car made it past the retention wires of the Littlefield parking garage on the seventh floor, and her BMW even struck the building across the alley on its way to the ground, where it ruptured a gas line.\n\nThe man driving the SUV was named William Burch, and he said that he had pulled into the alley to await his colleagues. That's when Burch said he turned around in the service delivery area, as seen in the above video. As he backed out near the dumpster, William said he heard a noise, since his window was open. Speaking to his mother on the speaker of his phone, Burch said there was soon a loud crash, and that's when he remembered a car that sailed over the edge of the same Austin parking garage eight months prior to the latest incident. Therefore, Burch put his Tahoe in drive and drove forward, but the car landed on the back of his vehicle.\n\nBurch said he could only imagine what his mother was thinking when he told her he had to go since a car had just fallen on him. William referred to the incident on September 12, 2016, when a different vehicle plunged over the side of the same parking garage, but was caught by a wire and suspended in midair. That driver escaped safely.\n\nNot all parking lot incidents end that way. As seen in the top photo above, a 62-year-old woman died when her car went over the edge of a parking garage in Spokane, Washington, on Saturday, April 8, 2006. Jo E.

The BMW then comes to rest on its roof, as nearby construction workers and bystanders come to the aid of the driver.\n\nPolice said the woman driving the BMW, who had serious injuries from the crash, mistook the gas pedal for the brakes and crashed through the parking garage barriers.\n\nBurch was uninjured. He was on the phone with his mother when the BMW landed on his car. \"I can just imagine what she was thinking when I had said, 'a car just landed on me, I gotta go.'\"\n\nOn Sept. 9, 2016, a 24-year-old man crashed through the barriers on the top level of the same parking garage. One of the barrier wires caught his SUV as it was falling and left his vehicle hanging precariously on the side of the garage.\n\nThe driver was able to escape with the help of a bystander.\n\nThe owner of the Littlefield Garage, located at 508 Brazos St., said these were the only two incidents of this kind they've experienced. KXAN reported the Austin Code Department issued the property a violation on Sept. 14, 2016, citing unsafe conditions, specifically unsafe barrier cable systems.\n\nSafety improvements made since the incidents\n\nAfter meeting with Austin Code, parking garage owner GTT Parking LP is making changes to improve safety, including looking into redesigning the entire cable system. Until then, temporary safeguards are in place on every level of the garage -- plastic barriers filled with water that act as an extra buffer between cars and those cables.\n\n\"It is a little scary that it got two hurt. Two accidents,\" Daniel Schuster told KXAN. It's something he says he can't help but think about as he pulls into the garage.\n\nAt first, he didn't know what to make of the first incident last September.\n\n\"It kind of seemed like a fluke thing. I was coming into the office and I heard on the radio to avoid the intersection, the car had gone off a garage,\" he said. But lightning struck twice. \"The cables, I mean after seeing two cars go through you just kind of get nervous. You don't want to hit the gas too hard, go off the edge.\"\n\nThe seventh floor, where the July incident happened, is currently fenced off with caution tape. Austin Code says its made several visits to the site with the property owner's representative, engineer, building official and city engineer.

Burch was about to park and inspect a nearby construction project he's managing when he heard commotion up above.\n\n\"My window was down and I heard something really loud and abnormal, so I just started driving forward and the vehicle landed on the backside of the Tahoe,\" Burch said.\n\nBurch was uninjured. The driver of the other car is hospitalized but expected to be okay.\n\n\"The retention cables didn't hold. The car went off the building, bounced off 515 Congress Avenue, fell and landed on a car that was going northbound in the alleyway before it hit the street,\" says Austin Police Department Cpl. Christopher Carlisle.\n\nIn September, another driver narrowly escaped injury in a similar scenario, but that time the garage's cables wrapped around the car's front axle -- dangling it in the air as the driver climbed out of the sunroof to safety.\n\nAccording to the Austin Code Department, the garage has had three violations since 2014. Two violations involved the elevator and the third came after the retention cables were broken in the September incident.\n\nCode enforcement went back out to the garage Thursday to put up security fences since the 7th floor retention cables are still broken.

Incredibly, the driver in the car survived the horrific accident.\n\nThe video begins with a large SUV exiting out of a parking garage in Austin, Texas. The SUV's driver suddenly hits the breaks. Moments later, a BMW falls from seven stories above. The car lands front-first onto the pavement, then violently bounces on the SUV before turning turtle. Shocked bystanders rush to help free the driver from the car.\n\nAccording to the American-Statesman, the woman driving accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake pedal and crashed through the parking garage barriers. She was rushed to hospital with \"non-life-threatening injuries.\"\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nThe Austin Police Department released the dramatic CCTV footage on Thursday, but say the accident took place on July 13.\n\nWorryingly, this isn't the first time an accident like this has occurred at this parking garage. According to KXAN, another car \"drove through the retention wires of the same garage and was left dangling nine stories in the air, but didn't fall\" last September. That car's occupant managed to climb out of the car to safety with the help of a bystander.\n\nClick for more trending news", "timeCrawl": "14:00:00", "sim": 0.6745098233222961, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1217, "date": "2017-07-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1224}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8923732", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Individual_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Individual Parks", "id": 235, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "id": 393, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "id": 415, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "id": 416, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "id": 418, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "id": 419, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

It lands upside down.\n\nBurch and other witnesses rush to help the woman inside. Officers say she hit the wrong pedal on the 7th floor of the garage and broke through cable wiring lining the parking spots. She would survive with what ems called non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nFOX 7 interviewed Burch that day.\n\n\"She was upside down. They had to pull her out from her seatbelt and her head was bloody and they pulled her off to the side under the awning. I rushed back over here and called my wife to let her know I was okay,\" he said.\n\nOn Thursday, we obtained surveillance video from the Austin Police Department and showed Burch the clips.\n\n\"Gosh. That's crazy,\" said Burch.\n\nThree different surveillance cameras captured the incident.\n\nOn the way down the woman's car hit a building on the other side of the alley taking out a surveillance camera. It flips over to show people inside the garage leaning out to see what happened.\n\nThen, there's another angle. It's a more close up look, but a bit blurry.\n\n\"It kind of brings back instant memories of what happened. I'm still doing work in that building,\" said Burch. \"For a couple weeks it was kind of hard to get back over there and after seeing this I'll probably be looking up again. I stopped looking up. Now I'll be looking up again.\"\n\nThe cables are hanging just as they were after the crash on July 13th. City code enforcement has made several visits to the site and is working with the property owner, their engineer and a city engineer to bring the cable system into compliance.\n\nTemporary safeguards in the form of water-filled barriers have been put in place along the alley side of the garage where there are cables.

The driver of the overturned BMW apparently confused the accelerator and the brakes and drove through the protective retention wires of the parking garage.

The horrifying incident was caught on a camera installed at the parking lot's ground floor. Thankfully the woman driving the crashed BMW car got away with just minor injuries.\n\nThe accident took place in Austin, Texas earlier in July but the Austin Police Department released the dramatic CCTV footage only on Thursday (August 10), since then it has been going viral. It is believed that the woman behind the wheel mistakenly hit the wrong pedal -- as in, the accelerator instead of the brake -- which could have resulted in the car speeding past the parking barriers to take the potentially fatal fall.\n\nThe viral footage shows an SUV exiting the building, and narrowly missing the crashing car. \"My window was down and I heard something really loud and abnormal, so I just started driving forward and the vehicle landed on the backside of the Tahoe,\" the man driving the SUV told Fox 7 Austin.\n\nHaving seen and heard the fall, onlookers rushed to help the driver from the car. She was later admitted to a hospital with only \"non-life-threatening injuries.\"\n\nWatch video here\n\nHowever, this is not the first this kind of an accident took place in this parking garage.

By Kyle CheromchaAugust 11, 2017Watch ThisAccidentBMWparking garageTexasYouTube | kxanSHAREKyle CheromchaView Kyle Cheromcha's Articles\n\nAuthorities have released video showing the moment a BMW 4 Series plunged seven stories off the edge of a parking garage in downtown Austin, Texas earlier this summer, narrowly missing a man driving his SUV as it smashed into the alley below. Amazingly, the driver of the falling car survived, according to the Austin Statesman.\n\nThe parking garage at 508 Brazos Street in downtown Austin features a cable guardrail system instead of the usual concrete walls to keep cars from flying off the edge on the back alley side. Unfortunately, the unnamed driver of the BMW was able to somehow push through the restraints -- the second such incident at that garage in the last 12 months.\n\nIn the clip, shot from a security camera in the alley below, we see a Chevy Tahoe completing a three-point turn and getting ready to park. All is normal until 0:30, when suddenly, the BMW plummets from the sky and lands nose down just inches from the side of the Tahoe, clipping the truck's back corner as it pirouettes and comes to rest on its roof.\n\nThe understandably-shocked driver of the Tahoe immediately accelerates out of the frame, and witnesses rush in from both sides of the alley to assist the woman in the BMW. The Statesman reports that she was taken to a nearby hospital with serious injuries, but it's a testament to the strength of modern vehicles and occupant restraint systems that she survived at all.\n\nLast September, a 22-year-old man driving a Toyota 4Runner managed to flip his truck over the guard cables at the very same garage, when he accidentally pressed the accelerator instead of the brake.

The woman driving the BMW survived but was seriously injured. Bystanders came to her assistance until medics arrived.\n\nLast September, William O'Connor's 4Runner plunged off the top ninth floor of the garage and was left dangling midair, held in place by the cables that should have prevented him from going over the edge in the first place.\n\n\"You know that you're about to die,\" O'Connor said. \"I feel like whenever I describe it, the words I'm using are inadequate to describe just the sheer terror.\n\n\"As I was falling, there were thoughts going through my head, like, 'I can't believe this is how I'm dying,'\" he told the American-Statesman and KVUE-TV.\n\nHere is the newspaper's account of the latest crash, along with its account of O'Connor's fall and his rescue from the dangling SUV by a passer-by. Video of that incident appears below.\n\nFrom news accounts, it sounds like the garage clearly has concrete parking curbs -- and five half-inch-wide steel cables, spaced 8-9 inches apart. Each cable is said to be rated to hold a 6,000-pound static load -- no word on what the math is on a moving vehicle. Also, the structure is 38 years old, so the cables have been exposed to the elements. The newspaper cited a local engineer who said such cables stretch out of shape over time.\n\nAustin police Cpl. Chris Carlisle told the American-Statesman said that unlike the O'Connor crash in which the cables broke, in the latest incident the car somehow \"went through the wires. They're still there.\"\n\nA spokesman for the garage company said that after the September crash, the company hired a structural engineer to inspect the safety systems and make repairs, which the city inspected and certified. City inspectors, however, say they have no record of that -- but say they're going to take a hard look now.", "timeCrawl": "15:21:00", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 55, "date": "2017-07-13", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 62}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8647139", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Electronics", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Electronics", "id": 197, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "id": 468, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable_Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Cable Television", "id": 1010, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Cables", "id": 1357, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Cable_and_Wire", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Cable and Wire", "id": 1402, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Wiring_and_Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Wiring and Accessories", "id": 1555, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

(Austin police)\n\nChristi Bowmer's BMW 328i convertible took flight deep in the heart of Texas.\n\nBowmer was parking her car on the seventh floor of an Austin garage the morning of July 13, when the vehicle mistakenly accelerated, going through retention wires and into a building across the alley. Her car tumbled to the ground, where it landed nose-first and struck another vehicle before coming to a grinding stop.\n\n\"I went straight down, and I watched myself in slow motion,\" Bowmer, 49, told the Austin American-Statesman. \"I thought I was going to die.\"\n\nShe nearly did. The Statesman reported that Bowmer broke her back, leg, ankle and sternum in the fall, and two arterial hemorrhages in her head threatened her life. William Burch was driving his Chevrolet Tahoe when Bowmer's car hurtled to the ground and clipped his vehicle, the Statesman reported.\n\n[Overturned truck of 'slime eels' transforms Oregon road into highway of nightmares]\n\nThe video of the incident, containing no audio, was recently released by the Austin Police Department. In the surveillance video clip, Burch drives through the alley and executes a U-turn, heading in the opposite direction. He briefly stops just ahead of where the car impacts on the concrete, dropping forcefully onto Burch's back end.\n\nHe was speaking to his mother on the phone, local station KXAN reported.\n\n\"I can just imagine what she was thinking when I had said, 'a car just landed on me, I gotta go,'\" Burch said. In the closing seconds of the video, bystanders can be seen rushing to lend assistance.\n\nBowmer is back to walking, but she cannot stand for long periods of time -- leaving her husband Joe to pick up duties around the house in Cedar Park, an Austin suburb.\n\nBut it was not the only near-death incident at Littlefield Parking Garage on touristy 6th Street in downtown Austin.\n\nWilliam O'Connor's vehicle dangling in Austin's Littlefield Parking Garage in Sept. 2016. (Russell Vargo/Facebook.)\n\nIn September, a man drove through five high-tension wires used as barriers and off the ninth floor of the garage. The wires wrapped around the wheels of the vehicle, leaving William O'Connor dangling from the garage for an hour before he was rescued, the Statesman reported.\n\nBoth incidents raised questions about the reliability of the cables as a a safety retention measure, and in the city's ability to regulate safety in public garages -- common fixtures in Austin's booming growth.

injuries. \"As I was backing out towards the dumpster, I heard something, because I had my window down\", said Burch.\n\nThe incident happened last month.\n\nThe woman in the vehicle which plummeted over the edge suffered minor injuries in the spectacular smash, and has since recovered. Therefore, Burch put his Tahoe in drive and drove forward, but the auto landed on the back of his vehicle. William referred to the incident on September 12, 2016, when a different vehicle plunged over the side of the same parking garage, but was caught by a wire and suspended in midair. The driver was able to get out safely.\n\nBizarrely, this is the second time in less than a year that a auto has fallen off the edge of the same parking garage.\n\nRelated News: 11 August 2017 Dravidian culture is pan-Indian, will continue to exist: Kamal Haasan 11 August 2017 BBCI: World Cup 2026: Morocco confirms it will bid to host tournament 11 August 2017 Liverpool owners vow to keep Coutinho despite Barcelona interest 11 August 2017 Fidget spinners causing unsafe accidents, USA government warns 11 August 2017 Disney to pull its Netflix content -- Newsline 11 August 2017 Korean shares end lower on foreign selling amid tensions over N.

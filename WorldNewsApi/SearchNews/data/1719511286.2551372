RTE news were at Dublin Airport, where passengers told them about their experience on the flight, with one describing how the plane \"fell\" for a number of seconds, and another sharing that the ordeal was incredibly \"scary.\" Paul Mocc told the national broadcaster that despite the chaos, the crew members valiantly looked after passengers and continued the flight service after the turbulence despite their own injuries. He described people hitting the roof, with food and drink going everywhere, and noted that crew members were limping around afterward with bandages. He also said he witnessed one passenger on oxygen who appeared to have back injuries, who was put lying down. Emma and Conor were travelling back from Thailand when they got on the flight to Dublin.

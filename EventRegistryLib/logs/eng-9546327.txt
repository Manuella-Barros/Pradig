Part of Embraer's newest family of regional jets, Scoot plans to add a total of nine of the aircraft to its fleet by the end 2025.\n\n\"(The jets') smaller passenger capacity makes them ideal for opening new routes to smaller but growing markets within the region, as well as enabling additional flights on existing routes. This will help enhance the Singapore air hub's network connectivity in South-east Asia,\" said Transport Minister Chee Hong Tat at the launch event held at Changi Airport Terminal 1.\n\nHe added that the new jets were an \"important milestone\" in Changi Airport's continued growth, as expanding Singapore's commercial aviation network in South-east Asia would allow it to meet rapidly growing demand.\n\nScoot's chief executive Leslie Thng told The Business Times that the new aircraft would allow the airline to expand to new destinations and build up its frequency with existing ones.\n\nThe E190-E2 will begin flights to Miri on May 20 and Kuantan on Jun 3. It will commence flights to Koh Samui on May 13 and Sibu on Jun 5 - both are new destinations for Scoot.\n\nScoot, a subsidiary of Singapore Airlines : C6L 0%, is the first to operate the Embraer E2 series of aircraft in South-east Asia.\n\nThe first E190-E2 was delivered to Scoot in Singapore in April.\n\nA total of five aircraft will be delivered this year, with the remaining four to arrive in 2025.\n\nWhen queried on how much additional capacity the new jets would give the airline, Scoot's Thng declined to give specific figures but said that the carrier was already operating above 2019 levels.\n\nHe added that Scoot would continue to take delivery of Airbus and Boeing aircraft, which would give it wider capacity to look at different opportunities.\n\nHe also said that the airline is now past its post-Covid recovery and now in a \"growth stage\", which it is looking at expanding further.\n\nThe E2 is a single-aisle regional jet with a capacity of 112 passengers. With a maximum flight time of six hours, it can serve all of South-east Asia as well as parts of East Asia, India and Australia.\n\nAccording to Scoot and Embraer, the E190-E2 is the most efficient single-aisle aircraft in commercial aviation and emits 25 per cent less carbon than the previous generation.", "source": {"uri": "businesstimes.com.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Business

Two of them, Koh Samui in Thailand and Sibu in Malaysia, are new routes for the airline, made possible by the smaller jet.\n\nTo commemorate the historic moment in Singapore aviation, passengers on the 112-seater aircraft's maiden flight to Krabi were given a model of the plane, a greeting card and elephant pants, baggy cotton trousers that are a popular tourist souvenir from Thailand.\n\nIt was the first time that an Embraer aircraft is being operated by a Singapore carrier, and the first time in decades that a plane not made by aviation giants Airbus and Boeing has been added to a Singapore carrier's fleet.\n\nIt was also the first time that the E190-E2 jet was flown commercially within South-east Asia.\n\nThere are currently two of these aircraft in Singapore, with the second having arrived here on April 29. Scoot said this second jet is in the final phase of preparations before it starts commercial operations.\n\nThe plan is for a total of nine E190-E2 planes to be delivered to the airline, with three more to arrive in the second half of 2024 and the remaining four jets to arrive by end-2025.\n\nScoot chief executive Leslie Thng said the carrier will add another three to five new destinations in South-east Asia to its network later in the year with the delivery of more Embraer jets.\n\nThey could include Kuala Lumpur's Subang Airport, which Scoot is interested in flying to, Mr Thng said on May 6 during a media briefing.\n\nAccording to Malaysian newspaper New Straits Times, Mr Thng said Scoot is waiting to see whether the airport will allow narrow-body jets to operate there before making a decision.\n\n\"We strongly believe that with this new-generation aircraft, we will continue to expand our presence in the region,\" he later said on May 7 at a launch event for the Embraer planes held at Changi Airport Terminal 1.\n\nMr Thng told reporters that the inaugural flights to Krabi and Hat Yai were almost full and forward bookings for its upcoming flights to Koh Samui and Sibu have been strong.\n\nWithout providing specifics, he added: \"We are now 5 per cent above 2019 levels in terms of capacity.

But it depends on when Subang Airport is open for jet operations. Because at this moment, it's only restricted to turboprops,\" he said.\n\nIt is noted that Scoot plans to expand its E190-E2 fleets up to five new destinations in the second half of 2024 -- from six currently; three in Malaysia (Sibu, Kuantan and Miri) and three in Thailand (Koh Samui, Hat Yai and Krabi).\n\n\"The E190- E2 is really to provide better network connectivity for us within the region.

definitely make the announcement in due course,\" he added.\n\nScoot has purchased nine E190-E2 aircraft, of which it has received two aircraft, while another three will be delivered by the second half of this year, and the remaining four are expected to be delivered by 2025.\n\nLast week, Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke said that Subang Airport would be able to handle jet aircraft by the third quarter of 2024.\n\nSubang Airport is currently undergoing a redevelopment as part of the RM1.3 billion Subang Airport Regeneration Plan (SARP) to transform the old airport into a city

Renowned as the quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle aircraft in the industry, the E190-E2 represents a quantum leap forward in air travel technology.\n\nIn a statement brimming with confidence, Scoot's Chief Executive Officer Leslie Thng expressed gratitude to partners and staff for their unwavering commitment, hailing the E190-E2 as a catalyst for expanding Scoot's fleet and bolstering its regional presence.\n\nThe inaugural flights to Krabi and Hat Yai marked the beginning of an exciting new chapter for Scoot, offering travellers access to idyllic island getaways and vibrant cultural hubs. With the arrival of the second E190-E2 and plans for gradual fleet expansion, Scoot is poised to revolutionise the travel experience for passengers across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Europe.\n\nAs of May 7, Scoot's extensive network encompasses 67 destinations spanning 15 countries and territories, reported TTR Weekly.\n\nFrom yesterday, May 7 onwards, Scoot operates flights via TR684 to Krabi departing from Singapore at 3.45pm and landing in the Thai province at 4.30pm daily.

These begin on Friday, May 10.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: Scoot to fly to Krabi and Hat Yai with new state-of-the-art jets\n\nScoot, the budget carrier under Singapore Airlines, is about to revolutionise travel with its cutting-edge E190-E2 jets, set to take flight in May.\n\nWith the delivery of the first and second of nine E2s scheduled for April, Scoot has unleashed its grand plan, unveiling the initial destinations for these state-of-the-art aircraft.\n\nThe E2s will pave the way for Scoot to venture into exciting new territories, with Koh Samui and Sibu topping the list, alongside taking over or enhancing services to Miri, Kuantan, Hat Yai, and Krabi. Starting revenue operations on May 7, the first E2 will whisk passengers to Krabi and Hat Yai, while its successor will expand the network to include the remaining four airports, with daily flights to Koh Samui starting on May 13.\n\nBut that's not all. Scoot is gearing up to ramp up frequencies, with Miri flights increasing from thrice weekly to four times weekly starting May 20, and Kuantan following suit from June 3. Furthermore, the airline will spread its wings to Sibu with thrice-weekly flights from June 5, reported Ch-aviation.\n\n\"This expansion marks a significant milestone for Scoot, propelling our network to 69 destinations, enriching connectivity in the region and solidifying Singapore's status as a hub.

On May 8, one Scoot flight was re-timed and there was no cancellation. No Scoot flight was disrupted on May 9.\n\nIn a statement to ST on May 9, Scoot, the low-cost arm of Singapore Airlines (SIA), said: \"Scoot can confirm that several flights scheduled in May 2024 are cancelled due to a variety of operational reasons, including aircraft unavailability because of a shortage of spare parts due to supply chain issues.\"\n\nThe airline said the shortage is affecting the aviation industry as a whole, but did not elaborate on the affected spare parts and aircraft types, citing commercial sensitivities. It also did not comment on the other operational reasons for the cancellations.\n\nThe airline apologised again for the inconvenience the disruption caused, adding that it proactively contacted all affected customers and re-accommodated most of them on other flights, including on SIA and Scoot.\n\nCustomers may also seek a full refund for the unused portion of their tickets, Scoot said.\n\nMayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, said many airlines are revising their flight schedules due to cancellations arising from checks and repairs for a rare manufacturing flaw with Pratt & Whitney jet engines.\n\nScoot said in March that three of its Airbus A320neos were grounded due to the manufacturing flaws, up from two before.\n\nBut a shortage of spare parts, said Patel, could extend beyond the engines to other parts of an aircraft, such as auxiliary power units that generate electricity and plane cabins.\n\nPatel noted that the aviation industry has been struggling with widespread disruption to production lines even after the Covid-19 pandemic, due to increased demand for spare parts from parked aircraft needing active maintenance and increased corrosion arising from high humidity levels such as in Singapore's climate.\n\nHe said it is common for such supply chain issues to cause flight disruptions across the board.\n\nThe increased demand for spare parts could also be due to a surge in aircraft orders as travel rebounds to pre-pandemic levels, and the replacement of parts for faulty Boeing 737 Max jets involved in incidents, added Patel.\n\nGreg Waldron, the Singapore-based Asia managing editor of aviation publication FlightGlobal, observed that airlines have been bedevilled by supply chain issues for some time.\n\nKenya Airways - one of Africa's biggest carriers - faced spare-parts shortages in January 2023 owing to the Russian-Ukraine war, which paralysed the aviation supply chain from Russia. It later announced potential flight disruptions in the second half of December 2023, as one or more of its aircraft had to stay on the ground for maintenance.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Japan's largest airline, All Nippon Airways, cut about 30 domestic and international flights per day - nearly 4 per cent of its daily services - to perform engine checks on aircraft with Pratt & Whitney jet engines.\n\nPatel said some solutions include extending the leases of aircraft - which Scoot had done for a number of its older A320ceos to mitigate the impact of the grounding of its A320neos - and leasing aircraft and crew from another operator to ensure that flights go ahead as planned.\n\nWaldron added that it is essential for airlines to identify the specific aircraft parts or systems facing supply chain disruptions and build up resilience in these areas, such as by increasing the supply of spares.\n\nSome past and present Scoot cabin crew and pilots had earlier told ST about a possible manpower shortage, with cabin crew on standby being called up almost 100 per cent of the time.\n\nCiting a labour crunch and engine and aircraft issues as possible reasons for flight cancellations, aviation analysts noted that a labour shortage has also been a significant problem for the aviation industry. -

This constant exercise at times also sees shifts in specific sectors based on changes in demand, passenger profile, and market dynamics. For instance, Scoot used to operate the Singapore-Bengaluru route earlier, but it was then transferred to SIA.\n\n\"At a group level, we have a committee that is chaired by the SIA CEO, which looks at the fleet requirements as well as the network development for the whole group...when we look at the market, wherever we feel that the FSC is more suitable because of the profile of the customers...then SIA will be operating to the market...Where we think that there are different market segments that the group will be able to target with a budget airline, then Scoot will be operating to the market,\" Thng said.\n\n\"For some markets, both airlines are flying. For some markets, it is quite distinct, where SIA is there and we are not there or we are there and SIA is not there,\" the Scoot CEO added. In response to a question on whether Scoot is looking to launch any new route between Singapore and India, Thng said that while the airline continues to scout for more opportunities in India, new routes are unlikely in the immediate future.\n\nOn the question of building synergies with the Air India group after Vistara merges with the Tata group's flagship airline, Thng said that it would be premature to comment on the matter and the focus is to see the merger through at the earliest possible. SIA will own 25.1 per cent stake in Air India after the merger, which is expected by next year. Most regulatory approvals for the merger have been received by Air India, Tata group, and SIA, and the few remaining ones are expected over the next few months.\n\n\"I think that (merger) process needs to be completed first. So, I will say that it is a bit premature at this point to comment on other cooperation that we may have with the Air India group. The focus is really to the merger between India and Vistara...that process will take a bit of time. So, our focus is really to let the process be completed as soon as it can be. Then, of course, we will look at what other opportunities we can work on together,\" said Thng, who served as the CEO of Vistara before his assignment as Scoot CEO.\n\nResponding to questions on whether Scoot would be using the Embraer E190-E2 aircraft, which the airline pressed in service on Tuesday, to operate to any destination in India, Thng said that the airline did not have any plan to do so in the immediately, even as he did not rule out the possibility of doing so in the future. Scoot currently operates flights to five of its six destinations in India using the narrow-body A320 family aircraft, while one route destination -- Singapore-Amritsar -- is operated using the wide-body Boeing 787.\n\n\"If you look at the range of the E2 (E190-E2), it does allow you to consider deploying it to India...But at this moment, our priorities are actually to try to deploy it within this region (Southeast Asia). Not ruling it (deploying the plane on India routes) out at this moment, but definitely it is not in our immediate plan,\" Thng said.\n\nThe E190-E2 has a range of up to six hours, which would cover large parts of India. The aircraft from the stable of Brazilian regional jet manufacturer Embraer will be used by Scoot to open a couple of new regional routes and increase frequencies on a few others by replacing the larger A320 family jets on those routes. Scoot has taken delivery of two Embraer jets already and another seven will be added to the fleet by the end of 2025.

On May 8, one Scoot flight was re-timed and there was no cancellation. No Scoot flight was disrupted on May 9.\n\nIn a statement to ST on May 9, Scoot, the low-cost arm of Singapore Airlines (SIA), said: \"Scoot can confirm that several flights scheduled in May 2024 are cancelled due to a variety of operational reasons, including aircraft unavailability because of a shortage of spare parts due to supply chain issues.\"\n\nThe airline said the shortage is affecting the aviation industry as a whole, but did not elaborate on the affected spare parts and aircraft types, citing commercial sensitivities. It also did not comment on the other operational reasons for the cancellations.\n\nThe airline apologised again for the inconvenience the disruption caused, adding that it proactively contacted all affected customers and re-accommodated most of them on other flights, including on SIA and Scoot.\n\nCustomers may also seek a full refund for the unused portion of their tickets, Scoot said.\n\nMr Mayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, said many airlines are revising their flight schedules due to cancellations arising from checks and repairs for a rare manufacturing flaw with Pratt & Whitney jet engines.\n\nScoot said in March that three of its Airbus A320neos were grounded due to the manufacturing flaws, up from two before.\n\nBut a shortage of spare parts, said Mr Patel, could extend beyond the engines to other parts of an aircraft, such as auxiliary power units that generate electricity and plane cabins.\n\nMr Patel noted that the aviation industry has been struggling with widespread disruption to production lines even after the Covid-19 pandemic, due to increased demand for spare parts from parked aircraft needing active maintenance and increased corrosion arising from high humidity levels such as in Singapore's climate.\n\nHe said it is common for such supply chain issues to cause flight disruptions across the board.\n\nThe increased demand for spare parts could also be due to a surge in aircraft orders as travel rebounds to pre-pandemic levels, and the replacement of parts for faulty Boeing 737 Max jets involved in incidents, added Mr Patel.\n\nMr Greg Waldron, the Singapore-based Asia managing editor of aviation publication FlightGlobal, observed that airlines have been bedevilled by supply chain issues for some time.\n\nKenya Airways - one of Africa's biggest carriers - faced spare-parts shortages in January 2023 owing to the Russian-Ukraine war, which paralysed the aviation supply chain from Russia. It later announced potential flight disruptions in the second half of December 2023, as one or more of its aircraft had to stay on the ground for maintenance.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Japan's largest airline, All Nippon Airways, cut about 30 domestic and international flights per day - nearly 4 per cent of its daily services - to perform engine checks on aircraft with Pratt & Whitney jet engines.\n\nMr Patel said some solutions include extending the leases of aircraft - which Scoot had done for a number of its older A320ceos to mitigate the impact of the grounding of its A320neos - and leasing aircraft and crew from another operator to ensure that flights go ahead as planned.\n\nMr Waldron added that it is essential for airlines to identify the specific aircraft parts or systems facing supply chain disruptions and build up resilience in these areas, such as by increasing the supply of spares.\n\nSome past and present Scoot cabin crew and pilots had earlier told ST about a possible manpower shortage, with cabin crew on standby being called up almost 100 per cent of the time.\n\nCiting a labour crunch and engine and aircraft issues as possible reasons for flight cancellations, aviation analysts noted that a labour shortage has also been a significant problem for the aviation industry.", "source": {"uri": "tnp.straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Paper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changi_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Changi Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320neo_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A320neo family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pratt & Whitney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corrosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auxiliary power unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlightGlobal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FlightGlobal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Nippon_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Nippon Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://tnp.straitstimes.com/sites/default/files/styles/rl680/public/2022060237409156d708ea07-6c64-4cbd-86e0-68fe69dacd05.jpg?itok=l3DTE57D", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546327", "eventUri": "eng-9546327", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "dateEnd": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 314, "textEnd": 324}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 206, "textEnd": 211, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 330, "textEnd": 335}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 504, "textEnd": 509, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Some of these flights were travelling to or from Bangkok in Thailand, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Manila in the Philippines.\n\nThere was heavy rain on May 4, which delayed 27 flights leaving Changi Airport. Twelve departing and arriving Scoot flights were cancelled that day, based on checks by The Straits Times.\n\nOn May 7, two Scoot flights were re-timed and there was no cancellation. One Scoot flight was re-timed on May 8, with no flight cancelled.\n\nIn response to ST's queries on May 6, Scoot - the low-cost arm of Singapore Airlines (SIA) - apologised for changes to some of its flight schedules, which it blamed on \"operational reasons\".\n\n\"We are working to re-accommodate affected customers onto alternative flights where appropriate and will also continue to provide them assistance where possible,\" said the airline, adding that it will give full refunds to those who choose not to continue with their travel plans.\n\nIn a Facebook post on May 3, which was later removed, Scoot had also cited \"operational reasons\" for the re-timing of several flights scheduled for May 3 to 5, May 10 to 12, and May 17 to 19.\n\nThe airline added it was progressively informing affected passengers of revised flight times via e-mail and text messages.\n\nScoot did not elaborate on the operational reasons behind the scheduling changes or provide ST with the number of affected flights.\n\nAviation analysts told ST that a labour crunch and engine and aircraft issues are possible reasons for such flight cancellations.\n\nSix past and present Scoot cabin crew and pilots spoke to ST this past week on condition of anonymity, because they are not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nA cabin crew member, who has been with Scoot for around two years, said some cabin staff left the airline recently for various reasons, including jumping ship to other airlines or quitting the industry entirely.\n\nA former cabin crew member, who left the airline in April after two years, said cabin crew on standby were called up almost 100 per cent of the time. Crew on standby may be activated for flights at short notice when someone calls in sick.\n\nAnother current cabin crew member of more than two years said some crew are not getting enough rest between flights, and this could have resulted in more sick leave applications.\n\nScoot did not comment on whether a cabin crew shortage was a contributing factor in the flight cancellations.\n\nMr Mayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, said a manpower shortage has been a significant problem affecting the global aviation industry.\n\nHe added that the large number of Scoot flight cancellations in this period was unusual, and cited issues with Pratt & Whitney jet engines as another possible factor.\n\nScoot previously said inspections for a possible rare manufacturing flaw with the engines - which could lead to the cracking of some engine parts - would affect four of the engines powering its Airbus A320neo fleet. This could force it to adjust some of its flights, the airline added.\n\nScoot later said three of its A320neos were grounded due to the manufacturing flaws, up from two before.\n\nMr Patel added that many airlines are revising their flight schedules due to cancellations arising from these engine checks and repairs.\n\nTax director Girish Naik, 52, was slated to depart from Singapore for Ipoh in Malaysia on April 28 at 6.45am, but was told his Scoot flight had been cancelled only around 5am when he reached Changi Airport.\n\nAlthough he was offered a seat on the next flight scheduled to leave about five hours later, Mr Girish was annoyed as he had lost \"valuable vacation time\", having awoken in the early hours of the morning to catch his original flight.", "source": {"uri":

On May 8, one Scoot flight was re-timed and there was no cancellation. No Scoot flight was disrupted on May 9.\n\nIn a statement to ST on May 9, Scoot, the low-cost arm of Singapore Airlines (SIA), said: \"Scoot can confirm that several flights scheduled in May 2024 are cancelled due to a variety of operational reasons, including aircraft unavailability because of a shortage of spare parts due to supply chain issues.\"\n\nThe airline said the issue is affecting the aviation industry as a whole, but did not elaborate on the affected spare parts and aircraft types, citing commercial sensitivities. It also did not comment on the other operational reasons for the cancellations.\n\nThe airline apologised again for the inconvenience the disruption has caused, adding that it proactively contacted all affected customers and re-accommodated most of them on other flights, including on SIA and Scoot.\n\nCustomers may also seek a full refund for the unused portion of their tickets, Scoot said.\n\nMr Mayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, said many airlines are revising their flight schedules due to cancellations arising from checks and repairs for a rare manufacturing flaw with Pratt & Whitney jet engines.\n\nScoot said in March that three of its Airbus A320neos were grounded due to the manufacturing flaws, up from two before.\n\nBut a shortage of spare parts, said Mr Patel, could extend beyond the engines to other parts of an aircraft, such as auxiliary power units that generate electricity and plane cabins.\n\nMr Patel noted that the aviation industry has been struggling with widespread disruption to production lines even after the Covid-19 pandemic, due to increased demand for spare parts from parked aircraft needing active maintenance and increased corrosion arising from high humidity levels such as in Singapore's climate.\n\nHe said it is common for such supply chain issues to cause flight disruptions across the board.\n\nThe increased demand for spare parts could also be due to a surge in aircraft orders as travel rebounds to pre-pandemic levels, and the replacement of parts for faulty Boeing 737 Max jets involved in incidents, added Mr Patel.\n\nMr Greg Waldron, the Singapore-based Asia managing editor of aviation publication FlightGlobal, observed that airlines have been bedevilled by supply chain issues for some time.\n\nKenya Airways - one of Africa's biggest carriers - faced spare-parts shortages in January 2023 owing to the Russian-Ukraine war, which paralysed the aviation supply chain from Russia. It later announced potential flight disruptions in the second half of December 2023, as one or more of its aircraft had to stay on the ground for maintenance.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Japan's largest airline All Nippon Airways cut about 30 domestic and international flights per day - nearly 4 per cent of its daily services - to perform engine checks on aircraft with Pratt & Whitney jet engines.\n\nMr Patel said some solutions include extending the leases of aircraft - which Scoot had done for a number of its A320ceos to mitigate the impact of the grounding of its A320neos - and leasing aircraft and crew from another operator to ensure that flights go ahead as planned.\n\nMr Waldron added that it is essential for airlines to identify the specific aircraft parts or systems facing supply chain disruptions and build up resilience in these areas, such as by increasing the supply of spares.\n\nSome past and present Scoot cabin crew and pilots had earlier told ST about a possible manpower shortage, with cabin crew on standby being called up almost 100 per cent of the time.\n\nCiting a labour crunch and engine and aircraft issues as possible reasons for flight cancellations, aviation analysts noted that a labour shortage has also been a significant problem for the aviation industry.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esther_loi@straitstimes.com", "name": "Esther Loi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changi_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Changi Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A320neo_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airbus A320neo family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_&_Whitney", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pratt & Whitney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrosion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corrosion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_power_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auxiliary power unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FlightGlobal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FlightGlobal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Nippon_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All Nippon Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/05/09/2022060237409156d708ea07-6c64-4cbd-86e0-68fe69dacd05.jpg?VersionId=vzRU1Mb5zUmGm21zVu2yN5o.6ebT1d8H", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546327", "eventUri": "eng-9546327", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "dateEnd": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 341, "textEnd": 351}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 218, "textEnd": 223, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 357, "textEnd": 362}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 536, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

This has also resulted in \"the softening of yields\". which are lower than 2023 levels but remain higher than 2019 levels, he explained. Yields in the aviation sector refer to revenue per passenger per kilometre.\n\nThe Scoot CEO was speaking on the occasion of the launch of its inaugural Embraer E190 - E2 flights from Singapore to Krabi and Hat Yai. The airline has taken delivery of two of these aircraft from the Brazilian aerospace manufacturer out of the total nine it has ordered, which will all be added to its fleet by the end of 2025. The planes would be deployed to connect a total of six destinations, of which Koh Samui and Sibu are new to Scoot's network while others would see increased frequencies.\n\n\"The aircraft will also help shorten connecting times at our hub at Changi airport,\" Mr. Thng noted, explaining the rationale for adding the 112-seater aircraft, which is a new addition to its existing fleet of Airbus A320 Neos and Boeing 787s. The more diverse an airline's aircraft fleet, the more complicated its flight operations and crew requirement get resulting in a higher cost of operations.\n\nThe Brazilian aerospace manufacturer has also been trying to strengthen its foothold in the Indian aviation market, where Air India and IndiGo have set global records with their aircraft orders but the Bengaluru-headquartered Star Air remains the sole buyer for its regional commercial jets with a total six in its fleet.\n\nThe Indian government's decision to remove the 600-km radius cut-off limit for awarding airlines subsidies for flights under the UDAN or regional connectivity scheme now presented an opportunity for its jets, Raul Villaron, Vice President for Sales and Marketing and Head of Asia and Pacific for Embraer Commercial Aviation, told The Hindu. The Embraer planes could be attractive for carriers such as IndiGo, which have a wide gap to fill between 70-seater ATRs as well as the newer A321 neo planes with a capacity of up to 200 seats it is now adding to its fleet, he observed.\n\nAsked about possible synergies in the planning of route networks and flight operations between Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group and Air India, in which Scoot's parent would hold a 25.1% stake after Vistara is merged into it, Mr. Thng said it was too \"premature\" to comment as the regulatory clearances for the integration were still underway.\n\n(The writer

Some of these flights were travelling to or from Bangkok in Thailand, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and Manila in the Philippines.\n\nThere was heavy rain on May 4, which delayed 27 flights leaving Changi Airport. Twelve departing and arriving Scoot flights were cancelled that day, based on checks by The Straits Times.\n\nOn May 7, two Scoot flights were re-timed and there was no cancellation. One Scoot flight was re-timed on May 8, with no flight cancelled.\n\nIn response to ST's queries on May 6, Scoot - the low-cost arm of Singapore Airlines (SIA) - apologised for changes to some of its flight schedules, which it blamed on \"operational reasons\".\n\n\"We are working to re-accommodate affected customers onto alternative flights where appropriate and will also continue to provide them assistance where possible,\" said the airline, adding that it will give full refunds to those who choose not to continue with their travel plans.\n\nIn a Facebook post on May 3, which was later removed, Scoot had also cited \"operational reasons\" for the re-timing of several flights scheduled for May 3 to 5, May 10 to 12, and May 17 to 19.\n\nThe airline added it was progressively informing affected passengers of revised flight times via e-mail and text messages.\n\nScoot did not elaborate on the operational reasons behind the scheduling changes or provide ST with the number of affected flights.\n\nAviation analysts told ST that a labour crunch and engine and aircraft issues are possible reasons for such flight cancellations.\n\nSix past and present Scoot cabin crew and pilots spoke to ST this past week on condition of anonymity, because they are not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nA cabin crew member, who has been with Scoot for around two years, said some cabin staff left the airline recently for various reasons, including jumping ship to other airlines or quitting the industry entirely.\n\nA former cabin crew member, who left the airline in April after two years, said cabin crew on standby were called up almost 100 per cent of the time. Crew on standby may be activated for flights at short notice when someone calls in sick.\n\nAnother current cabin crew member of more than two years said some crew are not getting enough rest between flights, and this could have resulted in more sick leave applications.\n\nScoot did not comment on whether a cabin crew shortage was a contributing factor in the flight cancellations.\n\nMayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, said a manpower shortage has been a significant problem affecting the global aviation industry.\n\nHe added that the large number of Scoot flight cancellations in this period was unusual, and cited issues with Pratt & Whitney jet engines as another possible factor.\n\nScoot previously said inspections for a possible rare manufacturing flaw with the engines - which could lead to the cracking of some engine parts - would affect four of the engines powering its Airbus A320neo fleet. This could force it to adjust some of its flights, the airline added.\n\nScoot later said three of its A320neos were grounded due to the manufacturing flaws, up from two before.\n\nPatel added that many airlines are revising their flight schedules due to cancellations arising from these engine checks and repairs.\n\nGreg Waldron, the Singapore-based Asia managing editor of aviation publication FlightGlobal, said flight cancellations could be due to a variety of factors, such as weather, technical problems with aircraft and air traffic control issues.\n\nA manpower shortage has also been a challenge for the sector, as it lost many trained workers - pilots, flight attendants, and ground and maintenance crew - during the pandemic, he added.\n\nThe labour crunch has led other airlines to cancel their flights in recent months.\n\nOver the Christmas and New Year season in December 2023 and January 2024, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific cancelled more than 80 flights owing to a pilot shortage.\n\nMore recently, Indian airline Vistara - co-owned by Indian conglomerate Tata Group and SIA - cancelled around 10 per cent of its flights in April because of crew unavailability.\n\nTax director Girish Naik, 52, was slated to depart from Singapore for Ipoh in Malaysia on April 28 at 6.45am, but was told his Scoot flight had been cancelled only at around 5am when he reached Changi Airport.\n\nAlthough he was offered a seat on the next flight scheduled to leave about five hours later, Girish was annoyed as he had lost \"valuable vacation time\", having awoken in the early hours of the morning to catch his original flight. - The Straits Times/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Crew on standby may be activated for flights at short notice when someone calls in sick.\n\nAnother current Scoot cabin crew member of more than two years said some crew are not getting enough rest between flights, and this could have resulted in more sick leave applications.\n\nScoot did not comment on whether a cabin crew shortage was a contributing factor in the flight cancellations.\n\nMr Mayur Patel, head of Asia at aviation data consultancy OAG, said a manpower shortage has been a significant problem affecting the global aviation industry.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "esther_loi@straitstimes.com", "name": "Esther Loi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoot", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changi_Airport", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Changi Airport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Singapore Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Straits_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Straits Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thailand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Multimedia", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/05/08/yaohui-pixgeneric-1633.jpg?VersionId=l73s84o4bMeb_nFkBm2QfH8w3wrt3PPY", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546327", "eventUri": "eng-9546327", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "dateEnd": "2024-05-05", "textStart": 1343, "textEnd": 1357}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "dateEnd": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 1359, "textEnd": 1375}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1381, "textEnd": 1397}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 178, "textEnd": 183}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 423, "textEnd": 428}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 590, "textEnd": 595}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 693, "textEnd": 698}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 758, "textEnd": 763}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1217, "textEnd": 1222}], "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

And then they\u2019re expected to go straight into class\u2019", "text": "There are simple ways to tell the stories of the Malvern Primary School on the Lower Shankill and its Catholic counterpart, St Joseph\u2019s on the Lower Falls, the latter just a few hundred metres from the back of the Europa Hotel. Both face daily challenges worsened by poverty; by more than a decade of British spending curbs; by the legacy of the Troubles in districts once riven by killings; or, simply, by discrimination in Northern Irish society. Both are led by inspirational school principals, with Genevieve McSorley at the Malvern and Mairead Weir in St Joseph\u2019s, a former past pupil who grew up locally at the height of the Troubles in the early 1970s. The simple story is that poor Protestant districts are worst afflicted by social ills, low aspiration, the ever-present hold of loyalist paramilitaries, or the hankering for days when the Protestant working class did not need an education to secure employment. This story also says that Catholics, for decades faced with sectarianism, have long seen education as the only route out of poverty, so that parents push their children to study, to go to college, to succeed. The story is true, or true often but not always; or, sometimes, it is a partial reflection of the reality that faces sociallydeprived communities. For every one of Northern Ireland\u2019s underprivileged, getting an education is hard work. One-eighth of people in Northern Ireland have no more than a primary education. Dropout rates at second level are high while the numbers in post-secondary education are a third of those in the Republic. Located on Forster Street, the Malvern school is still surrounded by the security fencing and magnetically locked doors installed during the Johnny Adair-era loyalist feuds of the early 2000s. [ Dublin-Monaghan attacks mattered less to Irish than Birmingham IRA atrocity, UK diplomat reported ] By the mid-2010s, Malvern\u2019s numbers had plummeted \u2013 fuelled by the feuds and the Shankill\u2019s population\u2019s collapse from 75,000 50 years ago to the mid-20,000s today, the most visible legacy of the Troubles and Belfast\u2019s industrial decline. Stormont\u2019s then minister for education, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s John O\u2019Dowd was invited to the school. Local parents applauded him on his arrival, one person who was there remembers. \u2018We will always be pushing children to have high expectations. There was a lot of negativity when I came here and it is hard to get away from that\u2019\u2014 Genevieve McSorley The school was saved. \u201cTo be fair, John O\u2019Dowd hasn\u2019t a sectarian bone in his body, even the Democratic Unionist Party would accept that,\u201d says former SDLP MP and education campaigner Alasdair McDonnell. The Troubles\u2019 trauma is intergenerational, says McDonnell: \u201cGranddad got married, did time, ended up with a dysfunctional family. It\u2019s literally cascading down the generations. The mental instability is turning up in the second and third.\u201d Today, Genevieve McSorley is six years in charge. When she arrived, Malvern had just 98 pupils, dangerously close to extinction. She brought it up to nearly 130. The arrival of asylum seekers saw numbers rise to 180. The children from Somalia, Syria and \u201ca lot from Sudan\u201d, Iran too, have brought extra funding which helps, though not without complications from some locals resentful of their presence. \u201cMostly it\u2019s very good. Mostly it\u2019s very quiet,\u201d says McSorley, \u201cthe children have integrated well, playing with each other. They\u2019ve made a big impact, because they and their parents are ambitious, they want to learn.\u201d Sometimes, though, tempers flare. Last Christmas, a party was held in a local community centre so the new children would not feel left out: \u201cEveryone got a gift,\u201d said one local, \u201cbut then some people got up in arms.\u201d McSorley chooses not to talk about the row, though parents were invited afterwards for coffee and games with children and bingo: \u201cThey enjoyed it and said they couldn\u2019t wait to do it again,\u201d she says. The two schools struggle for money. Greggs, the UK bakery chain, offers free bread. \u201cWe have children here who probably don\u2019t eat from the 12.30 free school dinner until the following morning,\u201d says McSorley. [ No line can be drawn under the Troubles for grieving families ] Breakfast and mid-morning toast and fruit are provided, too. The lunchtime meal is means-tested, \u201cbut we must be close to 90 per cent qualifying for that, including the asylum children\u201d, she says. Some teachers have found it too hard and quit after a few months. \u201cBut that\u2019s better that they just go,\u201d she says. None of the teachers live locally, but vital classroom assistants who would likely earn more working in a supermarket do. It would not be worth anyone\u2019s while to commute for the pay on offer. So, is she hopeful? \u201cI always am, I have to be. We will always be pushing children to have high expectations. There was a lot of negativity when I came here and it is hard to get away from that.\u201d Remembering her first sight of Malvern\u2019s fences, grills and doors, she wondered if she could cope. Today, the security is probably not needed, though it has occasional uses: \u201cIt\u2019s probably more expensive to get it removed,\u201d she says. Stormont and better-off schools do not \u201creally understand\u201d places like the Shankill, says McSorley, who will shortly meet the DUP\u2019s Paul Givan, who has been the North\u2019s Minister for Education since February, along with other Shankill principals. \u201cFifty per cent of ours need a wee bit of extra attention,\u201d she says of the children in her care, but educational psychologist services are threadbare. \u201cSome children are anxious or angry. Sometimes, there\u2019s just nothing there at all. They\u2019re blank. And then they\u2019re expected to go straight into class. It doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Malvern\u2019s nurture class helps, where small groups of pupils in a quieter environment slowly emerge from their shells with the help of the \u201cabsolutely brilliant\u201d teacher, Jenny McBride. \u201cEveryone wants to be in there,\u201d says McSorley, with a smile. Few of Malvern\u2019s students do Northern Ireland\u2019s transfer tests, which decide at 11 whether a child heads to grammar or secondary school. Not every grammar provides better education, though most get higher results. But they do provide better connections. Traditionally, it is argued that poor Protestant boys do worst, an argument that fuels loyalist resentment \u2013 they feel they are \u201closing out and that the other side is [winning],\u201d says one education expert, speaking privately. Undoubtedly, such boys often do badly, but a 2020 Economic and Social Research Council report painted a more complex picture: with poorer children from both communities not doing well, especially those with poorly educated parents. This year, Malvern has eight children preparing for the transfer test \u201cand none of them have dropped out\u201d, says McSorley. Better-off families elsewhere enjoy an advantage because they pay for grinds. At the entrance to St Joseph\u2019s primary school on Slate Street a mile away the doors open automatically and the noise from children of multiple nationalities in the yard is thunderous. [ \u2018Change must come\u2019: One man\u2019s fight to end Northern Ireland\u2019s segregated education ] Mairead Weir, born nearby on Sultan Street, enthusiastically greets visitors. \u201cBefore it was about keeping children safe, but the best care we can give is a full education, to open doors. We tell them to reach for the stars. \u201cEvery success, no matter how big, no matter how small, is celebrated. And we encourage the parents to enable children to reach for the stars. If they don\u2019t know how, we\u2019ll help,\u201d she says. Not one to pull punches, Weir is scathing about the North\u2019s transfer test: \u201cWe\u2019re in a system that is totally unfair, that separates children academically. I am an 11-plus failure, and it does stay with you, it does.\u201d (The 11-plus was the old academic selection test abolished in 2009.) Two-thirds of St Joseph\u2019s pupils qualify for free school meals, the best metric Northern Ireland has for tracking disadvantage, though changes to welfare rules over the last decade have damaged the value even of that measure. Education has always been a priority locally but hard to focus on when \u201cyou\u2019re struggling to put food on your table\u201d, she says, joined by colleagues Caroline Morelli and Laura McAllister, who leads the school\u2019s award-winning nurture unit. Together, \u201cEaster schools\u201d are held for \u201cborderline\u201d GCSE students or extra tuition for others over the summer. Ideas are borrowed from everywhere says Weir, who works closely with the West Belfast Partnership and local schools. \u2018There has to be a total reset of how government works. Departments must work together because a lot of what we are dealing with falls under health, or housing, not education\u2019\u2014 Mairead Weir Like her counterpart in the Malvern, Weir hunts for outside support. Sixty-five loaves of Greggs bread offer toast every day; money from Manchester United part-owner Jim Radcliffe\u2019s petrochemicals group Ineos pays for courses children would never access otherwise. Unemployment is a major problem but so too is the curse of low-paid employment for local people who work hard as \u201ccleaners, porters or in retail\u201d but who still struggle, Weir goes on. Morelli is St Joseph\u2019s parental support officer. Starting off as a classroom assistant, she later got a degree and now runs classes for parents to help them. She trains classroom assistants who have gone on to work elsewhere. [ A hard Border is now a patriotic cause - and we laughed at the British for that kind of nonsense ] The parents\u2019 classes are \u201cfantastic\u201d. \u201cWe could not accommodate the numbers,\u201d she says, emphasising St Joseph\u2019s place in the community. Years later, past pupils still return for advice about college options. \u201cThey\u2019re still our kids,\u201d she says, proudly. Last year, several dozen students did the transfer test; 15 got a place in a grammar school. \u201cTen more could have walked it, but they chose not to because we have good schools near us that are not grammars,\u201d says Weir. Space is a problem for St Joseph\u2019s and its 330 students. Two 50-year-old Portkabins show their age. A newer one cadged from the nearby Grand Central train station\u2019s developers will be ready soon. For now, every inch of corridor space is filled. \u201cThere has to be a total reset of how government works. Departments must work together because a lot of what we are dealing with falls under health, or housing, not education,\u201d she says, envious of the extra help that disadvantaged schools get from the Republic\u2019s Deis [Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools] system. [ Northern Irish plan to improve Traveller children\u2019s school outcomes \u2018isn\u2019t working\u2019 ] Southern teachers\u2019 salaries are noted, too. The St Joseph\u2019s teachers had some \u201ceye-opening\u201d staffroom conversations with student teachers from Dublin\u2019s Marino College, says Weir. Standing outside on Slate Street, Alasdair McDonnell agrees: \u201cOur political system has failed. We\u2019ve got the killing stopped, right, but the political system has failed. It hasn\u2019t failed the politicians, but it has failed the people. \u201cWe\u2019re condemning another generation to despair,\u201d says the former SDLP MP, who is on the board ofeducational charity the Goliath Trust. \u201cStormont has been run by civil servants for 50 years interested only in bureaucracy. Nobody is thinking about education,\u201d he says.", "summary": "Teachers in the Malvern and St Joseph\u2019s primary schools strive to overcome hunger, poverty and low-expectations of their environments to encourage children on to better things", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-style/people/2024/05/26/some-children-are-anxious-or-angry-sometimes-theyre-blank-and-then-theyre-expected-to-go-straight-into-class/", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/pvhXktVHwE1W-AStKF-VghESgT0=/1600x900/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(3600x930:3610x940)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/YHVJRMGJDBC5VJOEBOVSKOMQR4.JPG", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:46:39", "author": "Mark Hennessy", "authors": ["Mark Hennessy"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.079}

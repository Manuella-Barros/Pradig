A handful of customers had lined up almost an hour before the 9 a.m. reopening time, and a steady stream flowed in and out of the restaurant after the doors opened. \u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle, but you guys have been phenomenal,\u201d co-owner Mark Kotlick told customers minutes before the restaurant opened. The restaurant, 3259 E. 95th St., has been ready for a few weeks but was waiting on the health department\u2019s approval, which it received Thursday. In November, an \u201cintense\u201d fire broke out at the restaurant, causing significant damage to the one-story wooden building. Officials determined the cause of the fire was accidental and began due to an electrical issue. After the fire, Calumet Fisheries now has a \u201ccompletely redone interior,\u201d with a new menu board and open kitchen. Kotlick told the Sun-Times he expects the restaurant to be running at 100% in about a month. Calumet Fisheries plans to do a grand opening with discounted food, shirt giveaways and other festivities \u2014 likely in July or August. \u201cI\u2019m missing a deli case that got destroyed in transit and getting some other things in, but we\u2019re used to this,\u201d Kotlick told the Sun-Times. \u201cWe\u2019ll survive.\u201d", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/food-and-restaurants/2024/06/08/calumet-fisheries-reopens-after-extensive-damage-from-fire-in-november", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d6e3921/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F2e%2Fae%2F3ca928d5425f8c7b99675c2e0df5%2Fimg-", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:04:00", "author": "Mohammad Samra", "authors": ["Mohammad Samra"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.463}

{"id": 231936914, "title": "Michael Mosley's final message about beloved wife before tragic death", "text": "Dr Michael Mosley enjoyed enormous success throughout his phenomenal career - but always made sure to give credit to his equally talented wife, Dr Clare Bailey. The well-liked TV doctor, who has sadly died at the age of 67, offered insight into their marriage in a sweet message shared just two weeks before he vanished on the Greek island of Symi. Worried Clare, 62, raised the alarm after her husband failed to return from a coastal hike on Wednesday, June 5, leading to a frantic search for his whereabouts. Tragically, Dr Mosley's body has now been found, reportedly in a rocky area beside Agia Marina. There has now been a formal identification of the remains. For fans, Michael will be remembered as a formidably intelligent science journalist, who educated countless people on how to live happier, healthier lives. They will also remember his quick wit and ease with conversing with others, as evidenced in a final tweet sent a fortnight before his shock disappearance. Taking to social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, on May 25, one of Michael's followers asked him whether he'd seen himself being parodied on impressions show, Dead Ringers, declaring, 'I'd see it as an honour'. Michael replied: \"I have.. I'm not convinced I really sound like that but my wife Clare says it is spot on.\" Shortly before this friendly interaction, Michael also responded to a follower whose painful rotator cuff injury was soothed after he took the Just One Thing podcaster's advice on the benefits of taking cold showers. Once again showing his down-to-earth sense of humour, Michael wrote back: \"Delighted to hear it.. while reading your tweet (or is it your X) I had a bad moment when I thought you were going to say you got a rotator cuff injury after falling in the shower..\" Michael and former GP Clare, who lived in Buckinghamshire, had recently concluded their national tour, entitled Eat (Better), Sleep (well), Live (longer), with the pair attending the Hay Festival alongside other writers and experts, before heading off on their Grecian trip. The couple, whose strong relationship endured for 44 years, first locked eyes as young medical students at the Royal Free Hospital Medical School - now part of the prestigious University College London (UCL). Speaking about their early courtship with Sussex Living magazine back in January, Michael recalled: \"100 of us in the year and the Dean said four of you will marry, and I met Clare then.\" Michael and Clare went on to welcome four now grown-up children, sons aged 33, 31 and 29, and a 24-year-old daughter. They worked alongside each other on various projects and also supported each other when it came to living their healthiest lives possible, getting up to exercise together in the mornings before whipping up a healthy breakfast. This wasn't always their routine, however. Before they met, Michael never ate greens and Clare previously shared she still had to hide chocolate from her chocoholic husband. \"We say that he's a labrador because they eat anything,\" she told The Times in April. \"There were times when he would open a packet of biscuits and the whole lot would be gone.\" After their youngest flew the nest, Michael and Clare spent their final few years dining as just the two of them, often discussing the latest dietary research at the dinner table.

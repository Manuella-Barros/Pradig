Many banks including State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank have reduced their saving deposit rates by 0.5 per cent. \"Housing finance companies (HFCs) are likely to face intense competition in the mid-to-large ticket housing (above Rs 30 lakh) segment, if banks were to reprice (downward) marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR), following rate cut for savings deposits,\" domestic rating agency India Ratings and Research said in a note here today. MCLR can face downward revision up to 35 basis points for some of public sector banks and 25 basis points for private sector banks, according to an analysis done by the rating agency. Housing finance companies might find it challenging to expand their portfolio in the large ticket housing segment amid increasing prepayment rates on account of portfolio transfers, it said. \"HFCs will face a margin contraction in this segment, limiting the spreads to absorb all the costs, while trying to generate reasonable returns,\" the report said. The agency said increased pressure on the large ticket housing portfolio together with increasing opportunity in the small ticket housing space will increase HFCs' focus towards financing small ticket housing loans.\n\n\"This space is characterised by limited competition from banks, and hence, offers reasonable risk adjusted returns,\" it added.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303343", "label": {"eng": "Interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303347", "label": {"eng": "Credit rating agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308733", "label": {"eng": "Cent (currency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309474", "label": {"eng": "Saving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "310642", "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311126", "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317919", "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector_banks_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "367365", "label": {"eng": "Public sector banks in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "445228", "label": {"eng": "Marginal cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private-sector_banks_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "965134", "label": {"eng": "Private-sector banks in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcystin-LR", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1299483", "label": {"eng": "Microcystin-LR"}}]}

The rate above Rs 50 lakh was not changed.\n\nKarnataka Bank: The bank now offers three percent on saving accounts with deposits up to Rs 1 lakh. For deposits between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, the rate is pegged at 3.5 percent. And, for deposits above 50 lakh, the 4 percent rate is retained.\n\nAxis Bank: Axis Bank was the first private bank to follow SBI's move.The rate was cut by 50 basis points to 3.5 per cent for deposits up to Rs 50 lakh. The bank continues to pay four per cent interest on deposits of above Rs 50 lakh.\n\nIndian Bank: The PSU lender has introduced two tier interest rate structure for saving bank accounts and will offer 4 per cent interest per annum for incremental balance over Rs. 50 lakh and 3.50 per cent per annum for balance up to Rs. 50 lakh\".\n\nYes Bank: Private sector lender reduced the interest rate on savings bank accounts by 1 per cent to 5 percent for deposits of less than Rs 1 lakh.However, the 6% rate will remain for the over Rs 1 lakh to below Rs 1 crore deposit bracket.\n\nHDFC Bank: HDFC slashed rates for savings bank account balance below Rs 50 lakh to 3.5% per year.

The revised rates will be applicable to both resident and non-resident customers.\n\nThe new interest rates of both the banks will be effective from August 19. Besides, PNB has also reduced interest rates on fixed deposits of less than Rs 1 crore by 15-40 basis points on select maturities.\n\nSBI had cut interest rate on savings account deposits by 50 basis points to 3.5 per cent on balance of Rs 1 crore and below on July 31.

Another PSU lender Bank of Baroda had cut the rate to 3.5 per cent on deposits of up to Rs 50 lakh. Karnataka Bank too has tweaked the interest rate on savings bank accounts.\n\nThe 4 per cent interest rate on savings bank accounts has remained static since 2011 even as the overall interest rate and the retail inflation came down. The rationale for the rate cut is that the real interest rates are really high and \"there was no choice for the bank but to bring down the savings bank account interest rate. \"We have been cutting the term deposit rates and were watching for a right time to cut rates,\" said an official of a nationalised bank.\n\nAccording to SBI, the choice before the bank was to either raise the marginal cost of lending rates (MCLR) or cut savings bank interest rates. \"We did not consider it appropriate to raise the MCLR, because for lot of segments like agriculture, SMEs, retail housing, affordable housing, the cost and EMI would have gone up,\" SBI MD Rajnish Kumar had said.\n\nWITH PTI\n\nFor all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55019"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302943", "label": {"eng": "Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306110", "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308733", "label": {"eng": "Cent (currency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "311126", "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315835", "label": {"eng": "Savings bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "316654", "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "317919", "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krishna_Janmashtami", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "328631", "label": {"eng": "Krishna Janmashtami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328834", "label": {"eng": "Tibet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "338552", "label": {"eng": "Time deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banking_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "405325", "label": {"eng": "Banking in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dileep_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "416624", "label": {"eng": "Dileep (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_National_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "437651", "label": {"eng": "Punjab National Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "445228", "label": {"eng": "Marginal cost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "483644", "label": {"eng": "Sino-Indian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "522458", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adityanath_Yogi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "574878", "label": {"eng": "Yogi Adityanath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remya_Nambeesan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "833188", "label": {"eng": "Remya Nambeesan"}}]}

Six more banks followed suit. The bank gave dropping inflation and high real interest rates as the prime considerations for the decision. (File photo) Game of Thrones season 7's latest episode has got Twitterati excited for more reasons than oneAishwarya Rai Bachchan steals a million hearts in this white Manish Malhotra suit at IFFMAmit Shah resigns as MLA, says Congress will be reduced to half in next polls\n\nA number of public and private banks in the country have cut interest rates on savings bank accounts. The move started with the country's largest lender State Bank of India slashing interest rates on savings bank accounts from 4% to 3.5% per annum. True to expectation, others followed and till now seven banks have slashed rates.\n\nAfter cutting the rates, SBI had explained in a statement: \"The decline in the rate of inflation and high real interest rates are the primary considerations warranting a revision in the rate of interest on savings bank deposits,\" adding that the bank had reduced the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate by 90 basis points from the turn of 2017 on account of huge inflow of money in savings and current accounts due to demonetisation. Real interest rate plays a key part here as it is the interest that you actually receive after adjusting retail inflation. Due to the drop in inflation, the real interest increased substantially in the past after inflation dropped to a record low of 1.54% in June. This seemed to lay the ground for the rate cut.\n\nHow have the rate cuts progressed?\n\nState Bank of India (SBI): SBI announced rate cut on July 31 on savings bank accounts by 50 basis points effectively reducing the rate from 4% to 3.5% per annum on deposits up to Rs 1 crore. The rate offered on deposits above Rs 1 crore remains at 4%. .\n\nBank of Baroda: The second bank to cut rates was Bank of Baroda. It shifted to a two-tier savings bank interest rate as well. The rate offered on deposits up to Rs 50 lakh was cut from 4% to 3.5%. The rate above Rs 50 lakh was not changed.\n\nAxis Bank: The first private bank to follow SBI's move was Axis Bank. The numbers of rate cut, rate offered and applicable deposit limits were the same as Bank of Baroda.\n\nIndian Bank: The PSU lender said in a regulatory filing at the BSE that it \"has introduced two tier interest rate structure for saving bank accounts and will offer 4 per cent interest per annum for incremental balance over Rs. 50 lakh and 3.50 per cent per annum for balance up to Rs. 50 lakh\". The change was brought into force from August 16.\n\nKarnataka Bank: The changes were linked to daily balances. If the daily balance were to be below Rs 1 lakh, the rate offered by the bank is now only 3%, a change from the earlier 4%. If the daily balance remains over Rs 1 lakh to a maximum Rs 50 lakh, the bank reduced rates from 4% to 3.5%. The bank offers 4% interest on daily balance between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore. And a positive change seen was the revised rate of 5% per annum from the earlier 4% on daily balances over Rs 1 crore.\n\nYes Bank: The private sector bank reduced the interest on savings accounts with balance of Rs 1 lakh or less from 6% to 5%. However, the 6% rate will remain for the over Rs 1 lakh to below Rs 1 crore deposit bracket. For deposits of or above Rs 1 crore, the bank has reduced the interest rate from 6.5% to 6.25%.\n\nHDFC Bank: One of the biggest lenders in the country, HDFC slashed rates for savings bank account balance below Rs 50 lakh to 3.5% per year. The 4% rate will continue for deposits of and above Rs 50 lakh. The change will come into force from August 19, 2017. Also, it will be applicable on resident as well as non-resident account holders.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India had deregulated interest rates on savings bank accounts in October 2011. Now, banks are at a liberty to set rates of their choosing as they seem proper. Banks with higher market share and older presence had maintained interest rates of around 4%. The relatively newer banks or those that were attempting to make inroads to gain market share had offered higher rates of 6-7% like Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank.\n\nThe daily calculation of interest offered on savings was also started in 2010.

On balances below Rs 1 crore, SBI lowered the interest rate to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent. On balances above Rs. 1 crore, it continued to offer the rate of 4 per cent. After SBI's move, many lenders including Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and Yes Bank cut their interest rates on savings accounts. In 2011, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had freed savings bank deposit rates. Credit rating firm India Ratings believes that the beginning of reduction in savings bank rates by commercial banks will spur a new competition among them.\n\nIndia Ratings believes that with the interest rate cycle reaching the bottom, downward repricing of existing liabilities (savings account rate cut) could facilitate a further reduction in lending rates.\n\nFinancial planners say that keeping a large sum of money in savings accounts is not a good strategy.

Soon, top banks of the country followed suit.\n\nExperts have contributed the rate-cutting to a decrease in real interest rates and in the rate of inflation. This has led to surplus money lying with banks and low profitability levels.\n\nExperts also suggest consumers to not leave around money idle in savings account deposit as they are going to earn lesser. Instead, putting it to use through other financial instruments is more advisable.\n\nHere are the seven banks which slashed their interest rates:\n\n1. State Bank of India (SBI): SBI cut its interest rate with the introduction of its two-tier savings account interest rate system. Deposits below Rs 1 crore would attract 3.5 per cent interest rate, while deposits above Rs 1 crore would attract 4 per cent interest.\n\n2. Bank of Baroda: The bank reduced interest rate on deposits of up to Rs 50 lakh to 3.5 per cent. Deposits above Rs 50 lakh would attract 4 per cent interest rate.\n\n3. Axis Bank: The private player also cut interest rate on savings account to 3.5 per cent for deposits up to Rs 50 lakh. Deposits above Rs 50 lakh would attract 4 per cent interest rate.\n\n4. Indian Bank: The bank would pay 3.5 per cent interest on deposits up to Rs 50 lakh, while for deposits above Rs 50 lakh would get 4 per cent interest.\n\n5. Karnataka Bank: The bank reduced interest rate such that deposits below Rs 1 lakh would earn 3 per cent interest. Deposits in the range of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50 lakh would attract 3.5 per cent interest. Balance in the range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore would earn 4 per cent interest. The bank would pay interest of 5 per cent on balance above Rs 1 crore.\n\n6. Yes Bank: Yes Bank reduced the interest rate on savings account to 5 per cent on deposits of less than Rs 1 lakh. Balance above Rs 1 lakh and less than Rs 1 crore would earn 6 per cent deposit. Deposits above Rs 1 crore would attract 6.25 per cent interest.\n\n7. HDFC Bank: The latest rate cut was made by HDFC whereby an account balance below Rs. 50 lakh will now earn interest at the rate of 3.5 per cent per annum.

This takes the total number of banks to have reduced their savings account rate to seven.\n\nYes Bank has announced the sharpest cut on its savings deposits, bringing down the return on accounts with balances of up to Rs 1 lakh to 5% from 6% earlier. The bank has maintained the 6% return that it offered customers with deposits between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 1 crore, while reducing the rate on deposits above Rs 1 crore to 5.5% from 6% earlier.\n\nHDFC Bank said that those who have balances of up to Rs 50 lakh will receive 3.5% as against 4% earlier. Those with balances of over Rs 50 lakh will continue to receive 4%. The revised rates will be applicable to both resident and non-resident customers. SBI was the first to reduce interest rates on savings account by announcing a two-tier scheme. The bank had reduced the return on deposits up to Rs 1 crore to 3.5% from 4% earlier. It continues to offer 4% on deposits of over Rs 1 crore. The bank said that it was necessary to cut the return on savings account in order to keep its cost of lending low.\n\nUntil now, seven banks -- including SBI -- have reduced their return on savings accounts. The other four banks are Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, Indian Bank and Karnataka Bank. According to RBI officials, depositors continue to receive a positive return on their savings account considering that retail inflation is less than 3.5%. For most of the time, since interest rates on savings account were deregulated in 2011, real interest rates on savings account were negative as inflation ruled much higher than the 4% return offered on these accounts.\n\nAccording to SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya, customers can continue to get a better return on their savings account by opting for a facility where accumulated funds in a savings account get automatically transferred to a fixed deposit. These funds can be withdrawn any time, like a regular savings account.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55019"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308738", "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "313009", "label": {"eng": "Yes Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315835", "label": {"eng": "Savings bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "316654", "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "317919", "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336408", "label": {"eng": "Deposit account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "455683", "label": {"eng": "Indian Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "522458", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Bhattacharya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "1271999", "label": {"eng": "Arundhati Bhattacharya"}}]}

However, PNB has reduced interest rates on fixed deposits of less than Rs 1 crore by 15-40 basis points on select maturities.\n\nHDFC Bank's deposit rate cut comes in the wake of similar reduction in savings account rates by other banks including State Bank of India, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, YES Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank.\n\nAt the end of the June quarter, HDFC Bank's savings account deposits stood at Rs 1.93 lakh crore, up 26.5% from the previous year, while the current account deposits stood at Rs 1.02 lakh crore, up 34% from the year-ago period. Total deposits were Rs 6.71 lakh crore, an increase of 17% year-on-year.\n\nIn a recent note, Morgan Stanley Research wrote reduction in the savings deposit rate is likely to bolster banks' margin by 5-15 basis points. In the April-June quarter, banks witnessed pressure on their net interest margins due to migration of loans to MCLR as well as because of slippages.\n\nState Bank of India was the first to cut deposit rates, reducing its interest rate on savings account deposits of less than Rs 1 crore to a six-year low of 3.5% from 4% on July 31. It said large outflows in deposits accrued due to demonetisation made it difficult for the bank to maintain its MCLR at the current levels. Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank have also reduced the interest rate on savings account deposits by 50 basis points to 3.5%.\n\nKotak Mahindra Bank cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of above Rs 1 crore and up to Rs 5 crore to 5.5% from 6%. It left the rate on deposits of above Rs 1 lakh and up to Rs 1 crore unchanged at 6%. The interest rates on deposits of below Rs 1 lakh and above Rs 5 crore were also left unchanged at 5% and 5.5%, respectively.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303075", "label": {"eng": "Morgan Stanley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303343", "label": {"eng": "Interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308738", "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "311126", "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315835", "label": {"eng": "Savings bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "316654", "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "317919", "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "338552", "label": {"eng": "Time deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "368766", "label": {"eng": "Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mahindra_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "396797", "label": {"eng": "Kotak Mahindra Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_National_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "437651", "label": {"eng": "Punjab National Bank"}}]}

HDFC Bank and Yes Bank are the latest to reduce their savings bank account rate following the lead of the country's largest lender State Bank of India. This takes the total number of banks to have reduced their savings account rate to seven.\n\nYes Bank has announced the sharpest cut on its savings deposits, bringing down the return on accounts with balances up to Rs 1 lakh to 5% from 6% earlier. The bank has maintained the 6% return that it offered customers with deposits between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1 crore while reducing the rate on deposits above Rs 1 crore to 5.5% from 6% earlier.\n\nHDFC Bank said that those who have balances upto Rs 50 lakh will receive 3.5% as against 4% earlier. Those with balances over Rs 50 lakh will continue to receive 4%. The revised rates will be applicable to both resident and non-resident customers. SBI was the first to reduce interest rates on savings account by announcing a two-tier scheme. The bank had reduced the return on deposits up to Rs 1 crore to 3.5% from 4% earlier. It continues to offer 4% on deposits over Rs 1 crore. The bank said that it was necessary to cut the return on savings account in order to keep its cost of lending low.\n\nUntil now seven banks including SBI have reduced their return on savings accounts. The other four banks are Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, Indian Bank and Karnataka Bank. According to RBI officials depositors continue to receive a positive return on their savings account considering that retail inflation is less than 3.5%. For most of the time since interest on savings account were deregulated in 2011, real interest rates on savings account were negative as inflation ruled much higher than the 4% return offered on these accounts.\n\nAccording to Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman, SBI customers can continue to get a better return on their savings account by opting for a facility where accumulated funds in a savings account get automatically transferred to a fixed deposit. These funds can be withdrawn anytime like a regular savings account.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308738", "label": {"eng": "Rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "313009", "label": {"eng": "Yes Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315835", "label": {"eng": "Savings bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "316654", "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "317919", "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336408", "label": {"eng": "Deposit account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "455683", "label": {"eng": "Indian Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "522458", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arundhati_Bhattacharya", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "1271999", "label": {"eng": "Arundhati Bhattacharya"}}]}

Following the Reserve Bank of India's policy rate cut early this month, ideally, interest rates on loans should be the ones falling. Instead, banks are making a beeline to slice rates on savings bank accounts, nearly six years after deregulation in 2011.\n\nAs on Thursday, at least seven out of the 22 scheduled commercial banks have cut rates, taking a cue from SBI. The country's largest lender was the first to trim rates on July 31, introducing a two-tier rate structure for savings bank accounts, much before the hotly-anticipated repo rate cut on August 2. Since then, six more lenders, including public and private, followed suit and experts say more banks may join the chorus.\n\nSBI will pay 3.5 per cent interest on balances below Rs 1 crore and 4 per cent for above Rs 1 crore.\n\nFour banks including Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and Indian Bank followed SBI's two-tier rate structure, but Karnataka Bank emerged as an outlier introducing a four-layered rate card. While for daily balance between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50 lakh, the interest rate is reduced to 3.5 per cent from 4 per cent, for balances below Rs 1 lakh, it gives 3 per cent.\n\nThose above Rs 1 crore balances will fetch 5 per cent interest (revised upwards from 4 per cent), whereas, for daily balances of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore, the interest remains 4 per cent per annum. On the other hand, private lender Kotak Mahindra is unperturbed with trends in the marketplace, retaining savings bank account rate at 5-6 per cent.\n\nDeregulation of interest rates on savings bank accounts was intended to strengthen competitive forces, improve resource efficiency and strengthen the transmission of monetary policy. Savings deposits constitute a sizeable portion, about 22 per cent, of total deposits (as of 2011), and deregulation was to lead product innovation. But, it remains behavioural with players sticking to the script charted by dominant lenders.\n\n\"The profitability levels of Indian banks remain weak owing to the continued pressure on asset quality and low credit demand. It would be imperative for banks with adequate capitalisation to start gaining market share over weaker peers, which are starved for capital,\" India Ratings, a credit rating agency, said in a recent note.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "55019"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303457", "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306110", "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308733", "label": {"eng": "Cent (currency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309471", "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310106", "label": {"eng": "Deregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311513", "label": {"eng": "Outlier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315835", "label": {"eng": "Savings bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "316654", "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "316656", "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repurchase_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "316841", "label": {"eng": "Repurchase agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "365140", "label": {"eng": "Asset quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduled_banks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368767", "label": {"eng": "Scheduled bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotak_Mahindra_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "396797", "label": {"eng": "Kotak Mahindra Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "455683", "label": {"eng": "Indian Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "522458", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Bank"}}]}

On deposits in the \u20b91 crore and above slab, the rate has been pared to 6.25 per cent from 6.50 per cent. The new SB rates for resident and non-resident customers will be effective September 1.\n\nThe private sector bank said that the rate remains unchanged at 6 per cent for SB deposits in the above \u20b91 lakh and less than \u20b91 crore slab,.\n\nSince July 31, three banks have cut their SB rates. With effect from July 31, India's largest bank SBI has been offering 3.5 per cent on SB deposits below \u20b91 crore against 4 per cent earlier. The SB rate on deposits above \u20b91 crore continues to be 4 per cent.\n\nSBI said the decline in inflation and high real interest rates justified a cut in the deposit rate.\n\nBanks could make huge savings because of the cut in the SB rate. For example, on a savings bank deposit base of \u20b99,45,040 crore (of which 90 per cent is in the below \u20b91 crore category), SBI could save about \u20b94,250 crore from the 50 basis points cut.\n\nBank of Baroda and Axis Bank lowered their SB rate to 3.50 per cent from 4 per cent on deposits of up to \u20b950 lakh.

It is believed that a housing boom, actively encouraged by the government, in the lower ticket-size segment will largely be financed by these mortgage lending entities.\n\nYear to date, some listed HFCs have seen their share prices rise by 80 per cent or more. The price to book value ratio of some of these are at par or even more than some established private sector banks.\n\nThis is also perhaps not the end of the bull run. Mahesh Nandurkar, India strategist at foreign brokerage CLSA, has said they were very optimistic about the housing segment as affordability had increased. According to CLSA, the ratio of the monthly mortgage payment (or EMI) as a percentage of monthly income is at the lowest level in two decades, especially for houses costing less than Rs 40-50 lakh.\n\nBeside, the special thrust on the affordable housing segment under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) would mean the segment would continue to grow. PMAY provides an interest subvention of four per cent and three per cent, respectively, for home loans up to Rs 9 lakh and Rs 12 lakh. Further, an interest subvention of 6.5 per cent for a loan up to Rs 6 lakh for the economically weaker section and lower income group would be there till 2022. PMAY proposes to build 20 million houses for these segments in urban areas by then.\n\nAccording to Nandurkar, mortgage growth should continue to happen in the range of 15-20 per cent annually over the next five to seven years.\n\nCLSA's assessment on the housing mortgage segment is shared by many, including sector veteran Deepak Parekh. In his annual address to shareholders, Parekh had high praise for the government.\n\n\"This government's policies on housing are practical and implementable. With the benefit of four decades of experience in this field, I can confidently say that I have never been as optimistic about the housing sector as I am currently,\" he'd said.\n\nHowever, the space is getting crowded and the market is getting fragmented. In the annual mutual fund summit organised by Business Standard, held last week, fund managers doubted if the bull run at HFCs would sustain for long and for all.\n\nThere are a little over 80 HFCs registered with National Housing Bank (NHB). And, a number of new ones such as those floated by JM Financial, Lodha Ventures and Piramal are set to enter the market, mostly in the affordable housing space.\n\nAccording to Sunil Singhania, global head of equities at Reliance Capital, the sector offers lots of opportunities at the macro level and has the potential to grow at 20-25 per cent a year for the next 20 years. However, unlike banks, HFCs don't have the retail (individual) deposit base to back long-term loans.\n\n\"There are so many new HFCs that are mushrooming that the borrower will go to an institution which offers the best rates. If a State Bank of India is offering loans at 8.25 per cent, the new HFC will not be able to compete for the same quality of the borrower at that rate,\" said Singhania.\n\nAdding: \"Right now, the scenario is positive, as it is a long gestation advance. But, beyond a particular price to book, we would be very cautious. This return on equity of 18-21 per cent in a scenario where government securities are trading at 6.5 per cent looks like a dream for them to continue for years and years.\"\n\nMahesh Patil, co-chief investment officer at Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, agrees. He feels non-bank finance companies will find it difficult to compete with banks and so will cater to self-employed people, where they will have to individually assess the borrower's cash flow.\n\n\"It's an untapped market and here you can charge a higher yield. There is enough opportunity to grow. So, you have to look at the segmentation within HFCs,\" said Patil.\n\nWhile welcoming more HFCs in the market, Wadhawan of DHFL cautions that underwriting standards should not get compromised because of more players in the market. \"This is something the regulators should be worried about,\" he'd said.\n\nMeanwhile, low-cost housing projects are also on the rise. Oberoi Realty, Lodha Group and Sunteck Realty have announced their foray into affordable housing; this was after the finance minister announced sops for this segment in the Union Budget. Developers of affordable housing such as Tata Housing, Shapoorji Pallonji Real Estate, Puravankara and others are looking at launching more of these projects\n\nAffordable housing has been outpacing other segments because of the government's thrust on 'Housing For All', discounts on ready inventory, and improved sentiment among buyers, thanks to the new Real Estate (Development & Regulation) Act. The first half of 2017 has seen a resurrection here across India, with 71 per cent of launches under the Rs 50-lakh price segment, up from 52 per cent during the same period last year.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/History", "wgt": 100, "id": 327, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Museums/History"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 100, "id": 622, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "wgt": 100, "id": 737, "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302591", "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303006", "label": {"eng": "Security (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303083", "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303277", "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303385", "label": {"eng": "Investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303391", "label": {"eng": "Investment management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_budget_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306106", "label": {"eng": "Union budget of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307019", "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310642", "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310973", "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year-to-date", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313130", "label": {"eng": "Year-to-date"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313979", "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Housing_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "316658", "label": {"eng": "National Housing Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317503", "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P/B_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334661", "label": {"eng": "P/B ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Standard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "355651", "label": {"eng": "Business Standard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLSA", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "405329", "label": {"eng": "CLSA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliance_Capital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "524634", "label": {"eng": "Reliance Capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepak_Parekh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "525763", "label": {"eng": "Deepak Parekh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parekh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "607590", "label": {"eng": "Parekh"}}]}

According to the bank, customers who maintain a savings bank account balance of Rs 50 lakh and above will continue to earn interest rate at 4 percent per annum. Similarly, customers having a balance of less than Rs 50 lakh will earn interest rate at 3.50 percent per annum - a 50 basis point cut from 4 percent earlier. The new rate will come into effect from 19 August.\n\nHDFC Bank now joins six other banks -- State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Axis Bank, Indian Bank, Karnataka Bank and Yes Bank -- which have cut savings interest rate by 50 bps.\n\nOn 2 August, the Reserve Bank of India had given into market expectations and had cut key policy rate by 25 basis points to 6 percent. Though it takes almost three months before the policy transmission happens in the banking system, this time it took only a few weeks. In fact, India's largest commercial banks like State Bank of India (SBI) had already started cutting the interest rate on savings accounts, before the regulator's policy rate cut.\n\nReuters\n\nThe new saving rate for more than half a dozen banks today, stands at a meager 3.5 percent per annum. And, this is just the beginning, like it or not interest rates are on a slippery downward slope. Though lower rates work wonders for borrowers, it is the investor who suffers, especially senior citizens who largely depend on income from interest.\n\nSo, what should one do in such a case? Pankaj Mathpal, Certified Financial Planner, and Managing Director, Optima Money Managers says, \"It's about time that people must consider parking money in liquid funds, and not just in savings accounts. After instant redemption is now possible for Rs 50,000 or 90 percent of the amount. You stand to earn possible better returns than a savings account, as well as the same liquidity as that of a savings account. \"\n\nIf you want to invest for a long-term, what can you do? In such a case, equity mutual funds is a better option. You could even go for hybrid funds. Mathpal says, \"People must think beyond fixed deposits that offer just 6-7 percent rate and with rate heading downwards, they don't offer much.\"\n\nWhat if you want to invest in short-term strategy? \"For those looking in the short-term, debt funds make more sense. For instance, short term bond funds or short term income funds,\" says Mathpal. The returns generated by fixed income funds have been higher than those delivered by bank deposits in the past. Even though you should always pick the funds depending on your investment horizon and risk appetite, the current market scenario is ripe for investing in dynamic bond funds, income funds.\n\nWhat if you are a senior citizen? No one is as hurt by falling interest rates as senior citizens. \"Most senior citizens will continue to invest in Fixed Deposits (FDs), but they should invest some part of their funds in debt funds like Monthly Investment Plan (MIP) funds. Even investing in company FDs with good credit rating is an option,\" he says.\n\nRemember there are many company FDs that offer, higher rates for senior citizens and widows.\n\nIn short, as interest rates fall, you will have to look at a mix of these options to get the maximum advantage. If debt mutual funds have not been in your portfolio, it's about time you have it, even as you stay put with your equity investments.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 17, 2017 11:45 am | Updated Date: Aug 17, 2017 11:45 am\n\nTags :#Debt funds#Equity#Income#Income funds#Interest rates#Loans#Money#Mutual funds#Rbi#Sbi", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 100, "id": 504, "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303083", "label": {"eng": "Investment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304202", "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304719", "label": {"eng": "Debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306679", "label": {"eng": "Risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "308734", "label": {"eng": "Axis Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309428", "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "311126", "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "313009", "label": {"eng": "Yes Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "314528", "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315652", "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315835", "label": {"eng": "Savings bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDFC_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "316654", "label": {"eng": "HDFC Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "316656", "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "317503", "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "317919", "label": {"eng": "Savings account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319635", "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "336408", "label": {"eng": "Deposit account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "338552", "label": {"eng": "Time deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Baroda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "358935", "label": {"eng": "Bank of Baroda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Financial_Planner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "384340", "label": {"eng": "Certified Financial Planner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "455683", "label": {"eng": "Indian Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "522458", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka Bank"}}]}

File image\n\nSavak Tarapore, the former deputy governor of the RBI, who stood out as a strong voice in support of common depositors, once encapsulated the sum and substance of financial sector reforms in two words: \"customer service\". If that is the core of reforms, then the State Bank of India has just proved that it stands tall only in destroying all that the reforms agenda stood for. In one fell swoop, the bank reduced the savings deposit rate by 50 basis points effective July 31, from 4% to 3.5%, for deposits up to Rs 1 crore.\n\nSBI is India's largest and oldest commercial bank with a customer base of over 42 crore (post the merger with what used to be its associate banks). Reports say alm\u00adost 90% of the customers, small, diffused and not organised, and the true power behind SBI's financial muscle, will be impacted negatively. The change comes four months after SBI hiked its fees for a range of ordinary services and set out a complex structure penalising savers with lower balances.\n\nIn a country where many still work with low balances, where multinational FMCG companies and telecoms operators see value in selling by sachets, restrictions on the number of withdrawals, minimum balance requirements and curbing of ATM transactions send a signal that the bank is no more in service of the vast majority of the people of India.\n\nWorse, being the behemoth that it is, SBI has also signalled to other banks that this is a step they can get away with, and true to form, other State-controlled banks have already begun to follow suit. This is akin to cartelisation and draws immediate attention to a similar remark by the venerable Tarapore, when he argued that all banks offering a standard four% (soon after rates were deregulated) called for nothing short of an investigation by the Competition Commission of India.\n\nWhat we have unfolding before us today is the changing character of the nationalised banking system, and early signs of sharp practices that if left unchecked would land us in an ugly space of banks as sharks, preying on customers, who will enjoy safeguards in theory but will have nowhere to go in practice.\n\nWhat is the rationale behind the savings deposit rate reduction? What was the urgency to do so just before the announcement of the monetary policy decision by the RBI? When, if ever, will the reduction in savings deposit rates be passed on to the lending rate?\n\nThere is an erroneous view looming large in many fora (including the policy circle) that retail inflation is currently at a historical low (1.54% in June) coupled with a fairly reasonable economic growth rate (7.3% estimated for 2017-18). Going by the current inflation rate, the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation) looks positive at around 2% (3.50% savings rate; 1.54% stated inflation rate). The depositor is not penalised therefore, it might be argued.\n\nNothing could be as misleading. In the Monetary Policy Committee resolution (which came two days after the SBI shock), the inflation rate has been estimated at about four% in the baseline scenario. Thus, there is a negative real interest rate for the depositor. The inflation expectation is at an even higher level, according to the RBI survey. Thus, the low level of inflation rate as a contributing factor for deposit rate reduction is not convincing. Moreover, it is a misleading half-truth.\n\nNo respite\n\nOne of the possible contributing factors for rate reduction is money destruction in the banking sector caused by demonetisation and subsequent remonetisation, leading to banks being flush with deposits, tempting a rate cut.\n\nThe SBI has reported a multi-year high aggregate deposit growth of 18.14% to Rs 20,44,751 crore \"mainly due to the surge in savings bank accounts (which grew by 27.81%) following demonetisation\". This might tell us that demonetisation continues to take its toll on ordinary Indians, and this one will have a lasting impact on the pockets of the poor.\n\nThe SBI move on the eve of the MPC decision on the policy repo rate is an unethical action associated with moral hazard problems as it has the strong possibility of bearing on the decision of the MPC. It is appropriate if the government and RBI could prevail upon all the stakeholders in the financial sector not to take any policy decision on interest rates at least one week or ten days before the MPC resolution.\n\nWhile defending the savings rate reduction, the Finance Minister has observed that there is a higher interest rate savings rate (8% plus) for senior citizens and pensioners. One has to understand that these schemes are fixed deposits with a tenor of three to five years. There is a penalty for premature withdrawal here.\n\nIt is true that we live in the era of deregulated interest rates. Some private and foreign banks do offer rates higher than 4% but with higher minimum balance requirements and so are beyond the reach of poor and ordinary citizens. Protagonists of savings rate reduction and lower inflation should remember that complacency develops soon in times that appear good and wrong decisions are taken. Most of the NPAs are a result of our best times during 2004-08. The SBI's own NPAs are on the rise even now and were of the order of Rs 1.12 lakh crore as of March 31 this year. Can we blame the people of India for concluding that what the bank lost to the rich it is now recovering from the poor?\n\nThere is now an underlying interest rate arbitrage opportunity as well. The reverse repo rate of the RBI (overnight) is at 5.75%. The bank could mobilise funds at 3.5% and get 5.75% at the RBI window. One may argue this could be a theoretical case and banks usually do not enter in such activities. But money is fungible and behaves like water. Furthermore, there are strong possibilities that disintermediation of savings may take place even by the common persons to wrong investments where there are promises of higher interest rate.\n\nSBI has reduced the savings rate but has kept the marginal cost lending rate in the range 7.75% to 8.15%. This development shows that the organic relationship between the deposit rate and lending rate stands broken. This implies a clear profit-seeking move through higher interest margin. The latest SBI Annual Report was titled \"An enduring value-creator\". But its actions have shown it up as an enduring value-destroyer.\n\n(Rattanani is Editor, SPJIMR, and Pattnaik is Professor, SPJIMR)\n\n(The Billion Press)", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302748", "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303134", "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303276", "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303343", "label": {"eng": "Interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303387", "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303547", "label": {"eng": "Money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303713", "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303809", "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304013", "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304017", "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304018", "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304196", "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304611", "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306102", "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306110", "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307019", "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308017", "label": {"eng": "Truth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309474", "label": {"eng": "Saving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310155", "label": {"eng": "State Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311126", "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_Commission_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "542000", "label": {"eng": "Competition Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAVAK", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "552360", "label": {"eng": "SAVAK"}}]}

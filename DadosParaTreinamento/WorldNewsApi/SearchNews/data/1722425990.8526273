{"id": 243259022, "title": "Boeing Starliner crew not stranded in space, NASA says, but no return date set", "text": "\u201cWe have a little bit more work to do to get there for the final return, but they are safe on space station, their spacecraft is working well and they are enjoying their time on the space station,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to reiterate also that Starliner remains available in cases of an emergency or contingency on the space station where the crew would have to return very quickly back to Earth.\u201d Related: Boeing\u2019s Starliner launches on historic first crewed flight Stich explained that on Wednesday night, Wilmore and Williams and the other seven astronauts on the space station went to their respective \u201clifeboat\u201d vehicles \u2014 Boeing\u2019s BA, -0.27% Starliner, SpaceX\u2019s Dragon and Russia\u2019s Soyuz \u2014 when a satellite broke up, posing a potential debris risk. \u201cWe used Starliner for that safe-haven capability,\u201d he said. \u201cButch and Suni got in the spacecraft, powered the vehicle up, closed the hatch and were ready to execute, should they need to, an emergency undocking and landing.\u201d Helium leaks were detected on Starliner as it approached the space station earlier this month, although Stich noted that a leak check on June 15 found that the leak rates went down. The NASA official also explained that no helium is being leaked while the spacecraft is docked to the orbiting space lab. \u201cWe have those manifolds closed \u2014 we\u2019re not using any consumables in that area while we\u2019re docked. \u201cNow what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re taking our time to govern by the fault tree that we put together to look through the system, to look at [and] analyze data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to verify the helium margins and double-check those before we undock.\u201d Related: Helium leaks detected on Boeing\u2019s Starliner as it heads to the International Space Station Stich also explained that ground-based thruster testing will be undertaken at NASA\u2019s White Sands Test Facility in New Mexico, starting July 2. \u201cThis will be the real opportunity to examine the thruster, just like we\u2019ve had in space, with on-the-ground, detailed inspection,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce that testing is done, then we\u2019ll look at the plan for landing. We don\u2019t have a targeted date today; we\u2019re not going to target a specific date until we get that testing completed.\u201d Ground-based testing is important because thrusters on the Starliner service module, which transports the spacecraft\u2019s crew module to and from the space station, cannot be examined postflight because the module is jettisoned prior to the crew capsule\u2019s re-entry. After a series of delays, Starliner launched on its historic first crewed flight to the International Space Station on June 5. The capsule arrived at the space station the following day, after last-minute thruster trouble.

A return date of June 18 was set, although this was subsequently pushed back. The crew is not pressed for time to leave the station since there are plenty of supplies in orbit, and the station\u2019s schedule is relatively open through mid-August, NASA said in a blog post last week. Michael Lembeck, an associate professor of aerospace engineering at the Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois, told MarketWatch that NASA and Boeing are taking a sensible approach to solving the Starliner problems. \u201cThe service module does not come home, so the only chance that they have to investigate its problems is while it\u2019s sitting there at the space station,\u201d he said during an interview. \u201cWith their ground-based studies, they are probably going further into the investigation, trying to identify potential causes for the problems and, in doing so, they can test their hypotheses.\u201d Related: These space stocks deserve attention, analysts say Lembeck, a former consultant at Boeing who has also worked at NASA, told MarketWatch that every human spaceflight \u201chas its issues,\u201d noting that the space shuttle was plagued with helium leaks. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing unusual about this for the first flight of a complex vehicle like Starliner,\u201d he said. During Friday\u2019s conference call, NASA\u2019s Stich discussed the batteries on the Starliner crew module. \u201cWe talked about a 45-day limit preflight, limited by the crew-module batteries on Starliner, and we\u2019re in the process of updating that limit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have been looking at those batteries and their performance on orbit. They are getting recharged by the space station, and that risk hasn\u2019t really changed, so the risk for the next 45 days is essentially the same as the first 45 days.\u201d Starliner, he added, is really designed for a 210-day mission and \u201cthe systems are performing well.\u201d Related: SpaceX tender offer would value Elon Musk\u2019s space company at $210 billion, report says Boeing shares ended Friday\u2019s session down 0.3%.", "summary": "Boeing Co.\u2019s Starliner spacecraft will remain docked at the International Space Station while the aerospace company and NASA conduct further tests into thruster issues and helium leaks.", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/boeing-starliner-crew-not-stranded-in-space-says-nasa-but-no-date-set-for-return-db795140?mod=mw_rss_topstories", "image": "https://images.mktw.net/im-89567077?width=1280&size=1", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:14:25", "author": "James Rogers", "authors": ["James Rogers"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.323}

We need a federal heat standard to protect workers", "body": "Airport workers in Phoenix. A mail carrier and a fiber optic cable installer in California. This summer, workers across the country are staring down the barrel of on-the-job illness, injury, or death due to extreme heat. According to the National Weather Service, heat kills more people each year than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes combined.\n\nJuly 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded, and we can already feel the above-average heat predicted this summer in the United States. Last month, more than 100 million people in 27 states found themselves under heat alerts. Even in my home state of Maine, known for its cold temperatures, some of our northernmost towns broke records for high temperatures in late June. This will only worsen as climate change accelerates.\n\nShockingly, there's no federal standard that specifically protects workers in the United States from extreme heat. The Biden administration has proposed a federal heat standard that, if enacted, could improve conditions for millions of workers. During extreme heat events, many indoor and outdoor workers suffer from heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, heat-related injuries like burns or falls due to dizziness, and the worsening of preexisting conditions like asthma, kidney, or heart disease. Not only do workers face serious health consequences but they also stand to suffer economic loss and threats to financial stability. Their employers also feel the repercussions through lost worker productivity, increased health care costs, and worker compensation claims.\n\nWhat's worse, the workers who are most exposed to extreme heat and most in need of protection are disproportionately low-wage earners, people of color, and immigrants -- those with the fewest resources for protection.\n\nWithout a federal standard defining serious heat hazards, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is limited in how it can help protect employees from exposure to dangerous levels of heat and hold employers accountable to requirements for preventing heat-related injuries and illness.\n\nState standards can also offer protection to workers, yet only five of them (California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington) guarantee workers access to rest, shade, and water. Alarmingly, Texas and Florida have moved in the opposite direction by actually blocking communities from establishing heat protection for outdoor workers.\n\nThe proposed changes\n\nThe Biden administration has taken critical actions to protect workers from extreme heat by conducting workplace inspections across the country, beginning the process of developing a heat standard and issuing a heat hazard alert to remind employers of their legal responsibility to protect indoor and outdoor workers from extreme heat.\n\nOn July 2, the Biden administration published a proposed federal heat standard that would offer protections for approximately 36 million workers, signaling an effort to speed up a rulemaking process that typically averages over seven years. The proposal is now open for public comment.\n\nThe proposed standard would require applicable employers to develop and implement the following policies and provisions:\n\nThe faster this multi-step process takes place, the quicker workers will be protected. As another important step to this end, we must do more to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing this increase in extreme heat days.\n\nWith summer heating up fast, there's no time to delay. We have to protect our workforce, especially those who are most vulnerable, from the deadly hazards of extreme heat by enacting extreme heat standards. Workers can't afford to wait.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

And it is another White House climate-related initiative that could quickly be undone if former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, wins in November.\n\nNevertheless, the proposal is historic, and would apply to workers across all 50 states, including Florida and Texas, where state laws ban similar worker protections. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration estimates that the rule would protect as many 36 million workers, both at indoor and outdoor jobs. That includes not only farm labor and construction workers, but also mail carriers, delivery people and warehouse and logistics employees -- all sectors that rely on a significant number of Black employees.\n\nThe rule includes a number of new ideas, like a heat-acclimation period for new employees (most heat-related incidents occur in the first weeks at a new job) and the introduction of heat safety coordinators at workplaces. But most of what will keep workers safe is more straightforward: access to shade, water, and air conditioning, and mandatory breaks during periods of extreme heat.\n\nUnder the rule, there will be two heat-index thresholds -- 80 and 90 degrees -- at which different cooling requirements will kick in. When indoor or outdoor workplace temperatures pass 80 degrees employers will be required to provide water and climate-controlled break areas. At or above a heat index (or \"feels like\" temperature, which accounts for the humidity level) of 90 degrees, employers must also include mandatory 15-minute breaks every two hours and monitor employees for signs of heat-related illnesses.\n\nWhile workplace safety advocates applaud the rule, there is some sense that it's coming too late. According to OSHA, there have been 815 heat-related deaths of workers over the past 25 years, but that is almost universally understood to be a significant undercount.\n\n\"This is a bittersweet moment for farm workers,\" Teresa Romero, president of the United Farm Workers union, said in a statement. \"Every significant heat safety regulation in America at the state, and now federal, level was written in the blood of farm workers. Every year farm workers are killed by heat - with known deaths likely drastically outnumbered by the unknown, uncounted deaths.\"\n\nIt also comes too late for Eugene Gates Jr. a Black postal worker who died on the job in Dallas, Texas, during a hot day last summer.

We need a federal heat standard to protect workers", "body": "July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded, and we can already feel the above-average heat predicted this summer in the United States. Last month, more than 100 million people in 27 states found themselves under heat alerts. Even in my home state of Maine, known for its cold temperatures, some of our northernmost towns broke records for high temperatures in late June. This will only worsen as climate change accelerates.\n\nShockingly, there's no federal standard that specifically protects workers in the United States from extreme heat. The Biden administration has proposed a federal heat standard that, if enacted, could improve conditions for millions of workers. During extreme heat events, many indoor and outdoor workers suffer from heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, heat-related injuries like burns or falls due to dizziness, and the worsening of preexisting conditions like asthma, kidney, or heart disease. Not only do workers face serious health consequences but they also stand to suffer economic loss and threats to financial stability. Their employers also feel the repercussions through lost worker productivity, increased health care costs, and worker compensation claims.\n\nWhat's worse, the workers who are most exposed to extreme heat and most in need of protection are disproportionately low-wage earners, people of color, and immigrants -- those with the fewest resources for protection.\n\nWithout a federal standard defining serious heat hazards, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is limited in how it can help protect employees from exposure to dangerous levels of heat and hold employers accountable to requirements for preventing heat-related injuries and illness.\n\nState standards can also offer protection to workers, yet only five of them (California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington) guarantee workers access to rest, shade, and water. Alarmingly, Texas and Florida have moved in the opposite direction by actually blocking communities from establishing heat protection for outdoor workers.\n\nThe Biden administration has taken critical actions to protect workers from extreme heat by conducting workplace inspections across the country, beginning the process of developing a heat standard and issuing a heat hazard alert to remind employers of their legal responsibility to protect indoor and outdoor workers from extreme heat.\n\nOn July 2, the Biden administration published a proposed federal heat standard that would offer protections for approximately 36 million workers, signaling an effort to speed up a rulemaking process that typically averages over seven years. The proposal is now open for public comment.\n\nThe proposed standard would require applicable employers to develop and implement the following policies and provisions:\n\nThe faster this multi-step process takes place, the quicker workers will be protected. As another important step to this end, we must do more to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing this increase in extreme heat days.\n\nWith summer heating up fast, there's no time to delay. We have to protect our workforce, especially those who are most vulnerable, from the deadly hazards of extreme heat by enacting extreme heat standards.

- A record-breaking heat wave continued to grip the western United States on Tuesday, smashing records and endangering lives with little relief in sight.\n\nApproximately 162 million people -- nearly one-half of the US population -- were living in areas under active heat warnings, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIt said in a post on X the \"dangerous heat\" was expected to remain in the western part of the country for the rest of the week before moving eastward over the weekend, warning \"the persistent and record-breaking heat is extremely dangerous to those without access to cooling.\"\n\nAmong places that saw records shattered was Las Vegas, Nevada, which recorded its all-time high temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) on Sunday.\n\nIn Texas, the White House declared a federal emergency after the storm Beryl had left some 2 million without power as of Tuesday evening.\n\n\"The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat that is impacting Texans,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile, the southeastern United States and East Coast saw sweltering temperatures of their own, with heat advisories and excessive heat warnings in effect from Florida to Massachusetts.\n\nThe heat has been directly attributed to several deaths along the US West Coast.\n\nIn Death Valley, California, on Saturday, a motorcyclist died of suspected heat exposure and another was hospitalized, according to National Park Service officials.\n\nThe area, known as one of the hottest places on Earth, recorded a temperature of 128F (53C).\n\nFurther north, four men in the Portland, Oregon area have died since Friday as a result of heat-related illnesses, according to local newspaper The Oregonian.\n\nThough the Pacific Northwest is known as being generally more temperate than the deserts in the US Southwest, temperatures there remained elevated Tuesday after the Oregon capital Salem hit a daily record of 39.3 degrees Celsius over the weekend.\n\n\"This is a record-breaking heat wave,\" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, said during an online news conference over the weekend.\n\nSome people in California, he said, had seen \"not only the hottest day they've ever experienced but also the hottest day that their parents or grandparents ever would have experienced.\"\n\nThe heat wave comes in the aftermath of the Earth's hottest June ever recorded, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nRecurring heat waves are a marker of

which would affect about 35 million workers, according to the government - would apply to those working both inside or outside who can expect to be exposed to a heat index of 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius) or higher.\n\n\"The purpose of this rule is to significantly reduce the number of worker-related deaths, injuries and illnesses suffered by workers who are exposed to excessive heat simply by doing their jobs,\" a senior administration official told reporters.\n\nUnder the rule, employers would be required to develop heat injury and illness prevention plans and appoint a workplace heat safety coordinator.\n\nIf the heat index were to hit 80 degrees Fahrenheit, workers would have to be provided with drinking water and access to break areas in the shade or in air-conditioned spaces.\n\nMeasures would also have to be implemented to allow for the \"acclimatization\" of employees who are either new or returning to work after illness, including more frequent breaks and a reduced workload until they are back up to speed.\n\n\"Three out of four workers who die on the job\" due to heat-related illnesses \"die in that first week on the job,\" the official said.\n\nIf finalized after a period of public debate, the rule would be the first such rule in the United States at the federal level.\n\nIf the heat index exceeded 90 degrees Fahrenheit, all employees would be allowed a 15-minute break every two hours, and managers would be required to monitor their workers for symptoms of heat-related illnesses.\n\nSome workers, such as emergency medical personnel, would not be subject to the new rule.\n\nThe announcement, which comes as summer sets in across the U.S., is one of a series of measures the Biden administration has unveiled regarding extreme heat.\n\nBut the new work rule could be scrapped by a new administration should Biden not be reelected in November.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@dailysabah.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Construction worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscaping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landscaping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celsius", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Celsius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2024/07/08/thumbs/800x531/335838.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

It was \"rare to have such conditions this early in June.\"\n\nThe rapid attribution system is currently in a test phase, but will eventually be extended to other extreme weather events such as severe cold snaps and floods, the environment ministry says.\n\nIn particular, it will analyze the heat wave currently affecting Western Canada, where more than 50 daily records have been broken in British Columbia and Alberta in recent days.\n\nWith heat waves from Mexico to China and Saudi Arabia, June 2024 is the 13th consecutive month to set a record for the highest average temperature for that month, the EU's Copernicus climate monitor said Monday.\n\nIt also became the hottest June ever measured, erasing the record already broken in 2023.\n\nDeadly, record-breaking heat wave grips western US\n\nLos Angeles, United States (AFP) July 10, 2024 - A record-breaking heat wave continued to grip the western United States on Tuesday, smashing records and endangering lives with little relief in sight.\n\nApproximately 162 million people -- nearly one-half of the US population -- were living in areas under active heat warnings, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nIt said in a post on X the \"dangerous heat\" was expected to remain in the western part of the country for the rest of the week before moving eastward over the weekend, warning \"the persistent and record-breaking heat is extremely dangerous to those without access to cooling.\"\n\nAmong places that saw records shattered was Las Vegas, Nevada, which recorded its all-time high temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (48.9 degrees Celsius) on Sunday.\n\nIn Texas, the White House declared a federal emergency after the storm Beryl had left some 2 million without power as of Tuesday evening.\n\n\"The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat that is impacting Texans,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile the southeastern United States and East Coast saw sweltering temperatures of their own, with heat advisories and excessive heat warnings in effect from Florida to Massachusetts.\n\nThe heat has been directly attributed to several deaths along the US West Coast.\n\nIn Death Valley, California, on Saturday, a motorcyclist died of suspected heat exposure and another was hospitalized, according to National Park Service officials.\n\nThe area, known as one of the hottest places on Earth, recorded a temperature of 128F (53C).\n\nFurther north, four men in the Portland, Oregon area have died since Friday as a result of heat-related illnesses, according to local newspaper The Oregonian.\n\n- Records smashed -\n\nThough the Pacific Northwest is known as being generally more temperate than the deserts in the US Southwest, temperatures there remained elevated Tuesday after the Oregon capital Salem hit a daily record of 103 degrees (39.3 degrees Celsius) over the weekend.\n\n\"This is a record-breaking heat wave,\" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, said during an online news conference over the weekend.\n\nSome people in California, he said, had seen \"not only the hottest day they've ever experienced but also the hottest day that their parents or grandparents ever would have experienced.\"\n\nThe high temperatures also contributed to extreme fire conditions in California, where thousands of acres burned in active wildfires up and down the state.\n\nNorthwest of Santa Barbara, the Lake Fire burned nearly 27,000 acres (110 square kilometers), prompting evacuations and road closures Tuesday.\n\nThe heat wave comes in the aftermath of the Earth's hottest June ever recorded, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nRecurring heat waves are a marker of climate change caused by humanity's use of fossil fuels, according to scientists.", "source": {"uri": "terradaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Terra Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A historic heat wave that began blasting the Southwest and other parts of the country this summer is shining a spotlight on one of the harshest, yet least-addressed, effects of climate change in the U.S.: the rising deaths and injuries of people who work in extreme heat, whether inside hot warehouses and kitchens or outside under the blazing sun. Many of them are migrants in low-wage jobs.\n\nSunday, July 7, 2024 | 2 a.m.\n\nTemperatures are forecast to reach as high as 118 degrees today and remain above 110 throughout much of the week.\n\nYet despite record heat, outdoor workers in the Silver State have almost no heat-related workplace protections. While the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires employers to exercise a general duty of care and have potable water available to employees, neither Nevada nor the federal government has any regulations directly related to heat-related safety in the workplace. That may soon change thanks to President Joe Biden.\n\nLast week, Biden announced first-of-its-kind federal safety standards that would protect an estimated 36 million U.S. workers from heat-related injuries and illness while on the job. Those standards deserve the support of Americans across the spectrum of politics.\n\nUnder the Biden administration's proposed rule, employers would be required to identify workplace roles and assignments that are particularly susceptible to heat-related illness, provide training to employees and supervisors on the signs and symptoms, and develop emergency response plans to both prevent and react to such illnesses. They would also have to establish policies providing regular access to shade, water and breaks from intensive labor.\n\nIn remarks at the DC Emergency Operations Centers, Biden noted that, \"More people die from extreme heat than floods, hurricanes and tornadoes combined. ... These climate-fueled extreme weather events don't just affect people's lives. They also cost money. They hurt the economy, and they have a significant negative psychological effect on people.\"\n\nHe's right. According to the National Weather Service, extreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the United States. Moreover, the heat is only getting worse. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that urban Clark County air temperatures have increased by 5.8 degrees since 1970.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that as many as 2,300 people in the U.S. died from heat-related illness in 2023 -- more than double the number just two years earlier. As many as 100,000 more workers suffered from the effects of heat exhaustion and heat stroke, including cardiovascular and respiratory problems and impaired cognitive functions.\n\nThe latter is particularly concerning because it increases the likelihood of accidents and injuries on the job, endangering workers and imposing significant economic costs on employers. The risk is particularly high in industries that require outdoor labor, such as agriculture, construction and landscaping.\n\nHere in Clark County, a recent report from the Southern Nevada Health District revealed that heat-related deaths jumped 78% in 2023 compared with 2022, claiming almost 300 lives. Our neighbors are dying from the heat; we must support the proposed regulations to help mitigate the dangers.\n\nYet despite the scale and seriousness of the problem, only five states have specific heat-related protections for workers.\n\nIn the previous legislative session, the Nevada Senate Committee on Government Affairs proposed a bill that would have required employers to develop a training program for employees who may be affected by issues related to heat illness and a specific safety plan to mitigate heat illness on any day that the temperature is expected to exceed 105 degrees. Despite passing the Senate, the bill died in the Assembly Commerce and Labor committee without ever receiving a vote.\n\nMeanwhile, Florida and Texas have gone in the opposite direction by passing laws that prohibit local jurisdictions from imposing extreme-heat response plans on businesses or from requiring heat and water breaks for outdoor workers.\n\nLast year, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott justified signing a law that blocked local jurisdictions from making such protective rules by saying that he was concerned about a \"patchwork\" of differing local rules that might cause confusion for businesses. However, Abbott and Texas Republicans have not proposed statewide standards.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis used similar justifications when signing a similar law this year, citing the need for \"clarity,\" \"consistency\" and \"predictability.\" DeSantis didn't follow up with his own statewide proposal.\n\nThe Biden administration's proposed regulations accomplish Abbott and DeSantis' stated goals perfectly, and we call on them (though do not expect them) to offer their full support to the administration's proposal.\n\nSimilarly, while we have been harsh critics of Gov. Joe Lombardo for vetoing lifesaving legislation like reasonable gun control, Lombardo cannot bear the blame for Nevada's lack of state-specific protections for workers who labor in the hot summer sun. Democrats controlled both chambers of the Legislature in the previous session yet failed to put a bill on the governor's desk. This must change, starting with a unified show of support for the Biden administration's proposals from elected officials across the spectrum of political ideology.\n\nBy setting enforceable standards for heat safety, federal regulations would ensure that all workers, regardless of their location or employer, receive basic protections against heat-related illnesses and injuries while promoting fairness and consistency across industries and regions.\n\nMoreover, federal heat protection standards would provide clarity and guidance for employers -- many of whom may lack the expertise or resources to develop their own heat safety programs.\n\nAs climate change continues to drive rising temperatures, the threat of extreme heat to the American workforce will only intensify. The current lack of comprehensive federal regulations leaves millions of workers vulnerable to heat-related illnesses and injuries. It is imperative that federal action is taken to establish enforceable heat protection standards, ensuring that all workers receive the necessary safeguards to work safely in extreme heat. The health and well-being of the nation's workforce depend on it.\n\nThe debate is over about the existence of climate change and warming of the West. The impacts are real, deadly and getting worse each year. We must learn to perceive heat as a serious threat to health and safety, and demand that our elected leaders act. If we don't, Southern Nevada will be on the losing end of continued deadly interactions with extreme heat.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"},

How the extreme weather alert can affect you", "body": "When the National Weather Service puts South Florida under a heat advisory, what does that mean?\n\nDo we need to stay inside? Take precautions outside?\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nWhen is a heat advisory declared in Miami-Dade County?\n\n\u25aa The National Weather Service in Miami will issue a heat advisory if the heat index is 105 degrees for at least a couple of hours. Before 2023, the weather service issued a heat advisory when the heat index hit 108 degrees.\n\n\u25aa The goal is to spread awareness so that people protect themselves from extreme heat that leads to more than 30 deaths and hundreds of hospitalizations every year, according to county estimates.\n\nWhat is the heat index?\n\n\u25aa The heat index is a measure of how hot it really feels when relative humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature, according to the weather service. This is how hot it \"feels like\" on your skin on steamy days.\n\n\u25aa The weather service will initiate alert procedures when the heat index is expected to exceed 105 to 110 degrees depending on local climate for at least two consecutive days.\n\nWhen is it too hot to be outside?\n\n\u25aa The NWS HeatRisk Tool, launched on Earth Day by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides a seven-day forecast using a color-coded scale from green to magenta to tell you if a day is expected to be dangerously hot.\n\n\u25aa The new tool, which is in a trial phase, allows you to put in your address and see the local forecast with the heat information. If your area shows up as magenta, expect hotter-than-hot record-breaking temperatures.\n\n\u25aa The tool is different than a heat warning alert you might see on your phone from the National Weather Service because it combines the weather with historical data and context, including information from local medical providers and emergency responders about heat-related incidents. It also takes into account night-time temperatures. That's important in Miami because it's an urban heat island, with pavement and buildings absorbing and retaining heat.\n\nWhat steps can you take to prevent heat illness?\n\nMiami-Dade County has issued several hot weather survival tips, based on U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice, and noted who is most at risk:\n\nWho is most at risk of heat-related illnesses: Older adults 65 and older, young children, people with chronic health conditions or mental illness, athletes who exercise outdoors, outdoor workers, people living unsheltered or with limited access to air conditioning, pregnant people, and pets.\n\nWhat you should do:\n\n\u25aa Stay coolby spending time in air-conditioned buildings.\n\n\u25aa Avoid direct contactwith the sun.\n\n\u25aa Reduce physical activity and move to shaded areas.\n\n\u25aa Do outdoor activities in the cooler morning or evening hours, and dampening your shirt or wrapping a wet scarf or bandana around your neck or forehead could also help.\n\n\u25aa Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water or drinks with electrolytes if you're sweating. Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink more.

Early risers or evening runners face less of a risk - the Sun isn't as hot and the air temperature is lower.\n\nREAD MORE: How student athletes can stay safe from extreme heat\n\nREAD MORE: Digging in the sand can be deadly. No, really\n\nBut if your normal routine is to go for a run midmorning or over lunch, you probably want to rethink exercising in the heat.\n\nPretty much everywhere in the U.S., the hottest part of the day is between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. The body will gain heat from both the air temperature and solar radiation. The ground also heats up, so you'll feel more heat rising up from the asphalt or grass.\n\nAdd humidity to the mix and that will also affect your body's ability to dissipate heat through sweat.\n\nDon't forget that the body also generates internal heat when you're active, whether you're running or even mowing your lawn. When it's warm to hot outside, you're further increasing your heat gain through that exertion. The harder someone runs or cycles, the more heat they're generating.\n\nOutdoor workers on farms, construction sites or even walking dogs are often in the heat longer, with less flexibility for breaks.\n\nDo our bodies eventually adapt to summer heat?\n\nIt takes about two weeks for the typical person to fully acclimatize to higher temperatures. Over that time, your body makes amazing adaptations to handle the heat.\n\nYour sweat rate improves, dissipating heat more effectively. Your plasma volume expands so you have more blood pumping through your body, so the heart doesn't have to work as hard. Because your cardiovascular system is more efficient, your body doesn't heat up as much. You also retain salt a bit better, which helps you keep water in your body.\n\nThat doesn't mean you're ready for even higher temperatures or extreme heat, though. Even if you're acclimatized to 80-degree weather, you might not be ready for a 95-degree heat wave. When we get early season heat waves and high humidity, that can reach a level people aren't adapted to handle yet. And some combinations of heat and humidity are too much for anyone to safely spend much time in.\n\nAre young children and older people at higher risk in the heat?\n\nIn older adults, the cardiovascular system isn't as flexible and powerful as it used to be, so it doesn't operate as efficiently, and sweating mechanisms decrease. That leaves older adults at greater risk for illnesses such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke.\n\nTheir thirst mechanism may also not function as well, leaving them more likely to become dehydrated. Some older adults are also less willing or able than younger people to seek out cooling centers.\n\nREAD MORE: Tips for staying safe in extreme heat\n\nChildren might take a few more days to acclimatize than adults. They're also more dependent on skin heat loss than sweating, which is why their skin can get red and flushed-looking.\n\nChildren are probably better about complaining about feeling too hot or not feeling well, though, so listen to them and help them seek out cooler areas. They might not realize that they can take a break during soccer practice, or that they should come in from the beach.\n\nWhat are your top heat safety tips?\n\nBe smart about the time of day you're being active: People love their routines, but you need to get the workout and yard work and other outdoor activities done early in the day or late in the evening. Avoiding the hottest parts of the day is the smartest way to prevent heat illnesses. When outside and the Sun is up, seek places with shade.\n\nHave good hydration habits: Don't ignore thirst - it's your body telling you something. Hydration keeps your plasma volume higher to help your heart work less and decreases your overall risk for heat illnesses. Your brain and muscles are also composed of water, so if your body senses that you don't have enough water, it will start to sacrifice other things, including how much you're sweating.\n\nListen to your body: When you do need to be outside to work or play, your body will give you cues regarding how it's handling the heat. If you don't feel well, feel hot or can't seem to push harder, your body is telling you to slow down, add extra breaks or get out of the situation.\n\nMake smart clothing choices: Wear light-colored clothing, which absorbs less heat than dark clothes. Short-sleeved shirts and shorts can also avoid helping heat build up or impairing sweat evaporation.\n\nRemember that helmets and sports equipment hold in heat: Construction workers often have to wear hard hats, but athletes don't always need to practice with shoulder pads and helmets, especially in high heat. To help workers, there is a push for companies to follow health safety guidelines, such as providing cooling stations and hydration breaks.\n\nGet a good night's sleep: Heat exposure one day can affect your risk the following day. If you can sleep in air conditioning and get a good night's sleep, that may help decrease the risk of heat illness.\n\nThis story was originally published at The Conversation.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Acclimatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar irradiance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphalt_concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asphalt concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_volume", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood volume"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_hat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hard hat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Climate Control", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical Therapy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2024/07/GettyImages-143175641-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The lawsuit was filed just hours after the FTC voted 3-2 to issue the nationwide ban. The temporary injunction halts the ban that was set to take effect September 4 until the court rules on the merits of the case on or before August 30, 2024. Judge Brown, appointed by President Trump in 2019, enjoined the rule for lack of statutory authority and on arbitrary and capricious grounds. Rejecting a nationwide injunction and refusing to extend the injunction to the Chamber of Commerce's associational members for lack of standing, Judge Brown's ruling only provides relief to the named plaintiffs in the matter. Notably, although the matter did not turn on the application of the recently decided Loper Bright holding, Judge Brown's ruling cited the decision for the general proposition that \"[t]he deference that Chevron requires of courts reviewing agency action cannot be squared with the APA.\"\n\nThe Biden Administration's Department of Labor officially released their proposed new rule to address excessive heat risks in the workplace on Tuesday, July 2, 2024. If finalized, the proposed role is estimated to protect roughly 36 million workers in indoor and outdoor work settings, such as farmworkers, delivery and construction workers, and workers in warehouses and factories. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) proposed rule, employers would be required to identify heat hazards, develop emergency response plans, and establish rest breaks, provide shade and water, and heat acclimatization. The rule establishes an initial heat trigger at a heat index of 80\u00b0F and a high heat trigger at a heat index of 90\u00b0F or a wet bulb globe temperature equal to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's recommended limit. The proposal increases penalties for heat-related workplace violations.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 3, 2024, the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) announced that the unionized workers of Food 4 Less voted to ratify a new three-year labor contract after the workers had previously authorized a strike if labor talks had failed. The new agreement covers 6,000 low-wage grocery workers across 15 Food 4 Less stores in the Los Angeles area. Food 4 less is a subsidiary of the major grocery company, The Kroger Company. The ratified labor contract includes wage increase for all workers, increased starting wage rates, more guaranteed hours for part-time workers, a reduction in the hour threshold to receive the top pay rate, additional premiums for select positions, and bonuses for all workers. Support for the new contract is not uniform across workers, with some reports noting discontent among union members.", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injunction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Trade_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Trade Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Northern_District_of_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_4_Less", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food 4 Less"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employment contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-compete_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-compete clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Chamber_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Chamber of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocery_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grocery store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Standing (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychological_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Psychological Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chevron Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greater Los Angeles"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Food_and_Commercial_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Food and Commercial Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Occupational_Safety_and_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroger", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kroger"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 20, "textEnd": 26}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-04", "textStart": 818, "textEnd": 829}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

On July Fourth, roughly half of all Americans were under extreme heat alerts. The trend continued through the holiday and into the next week, shattering temperature records in cities across the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, roughly 140 million Americans, over a third of the country, remained under active National Weather Service extreme heat advisories, watches, and warnings. A heat risk map released by federal agencies showed that the worst of the conditions were along each coast, marked by swaths of color-coded severity. On the West Coast, states from Washington to Arizona were awash in deep burgundy -- extreme risk. Along the East Coast, states from Maine to Florida were splotched with scarlet -- major risk.\n\n\"There's not a whole lot of relief in sight,\" said Zach Taylor, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. In fact, the heat on both coasts could stick around through mid to late July. \"This is a very dangerous and serious situation that people should not take lightly.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Las Vegas breached 120 degrees Fahrenheit, eclipsing the city's 2017 record by 4 degrees. By Tuesday, roads were buckling in Washington D.C., as the city hit 110 degrees F, and daily record highs were set in Seattle and across the Pacific Northwest.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Heat and Health Tracker reveals an increase in heat-related emergency room visits in the most intensely-hit areas. This time last year, similar temperatures took over 645 lives just in Arizona's Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, where the thermostat hovered around 110 degrees F for a month.\n\nThese dangerous conditions are the continuation of climate trends, following more than a year of record-breaking temperatures. Worldwide, the last 13 months have been the hottest ever recorded, and the last 12 months have surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial temperatures - a foreboding climate milestone.\n\nAccording to Taylor, these heat waves are especially notable in intensity and length -- features connected to human-caused planetary warming. Studies have shown that climate change creates heat waves that are more intense, linger for longer, and move slower.\n\nScorching temperatures are also fueling wildfires. When heat is paired with low humidity and high winds, small ignitions can quickly grow into infernos. As of July 10, the National Interagency Fire Center tracker showed there are 76 large active fires across the country, and almost all of them are in states under heat advisories. In Santa Barbara County, California, the Lake Fire has ballooned into a 28,000 acre blaze, the largest the state has seen this year. In Southern and Central Oregon, officials are ordering evacuation notices for multiple wildfires.\n\nCities are especially dangerous due to the urban heat island effect, in which buildings and roads trap and amplify heat. In Phoenix, a hundred degree day can turn the asphalt into a 160-degree F griddle, leaving those who touch it with life-threatening burns. As temperatures rise, urban conditions also become ripe for a chemical reaction that creates ground-level ozone pollution, which can cause asthma and respiratory problems. On Monday, New York State issued an air quality advisory after this pollutant was detected at harmful levels.\n\nAnd health threats don't go away with the sun. In addition to the record daily temperatures, Taylor says, stagnant air can cause lingering highs overnight. \"That can be equally, if not more, impactful to the health and heat stress, because it doesn't give the body an opportunity to cool off and recover at night.\"\n\n\"Heat is an issue that is cumulative,\" said Claudia Brown, a health scientist at the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health. \"So it's not just necessarily a single hot day that leads to heat related illnesses, but really having consecutive high temperatures,\" Studies have shown that the risk of death compounds with each consecutive day of heat, and raised nighttime temperatures make it even worse.\n\nAnd not everybody is at equal risk. \"People that are older or young children tend to be more vulnerable because their bodies don't thermoregulate as effectively,\" Brown said.\n\nOther factors, like chronic health conditions and working outdoors, can exacerbate the odds and severity of heat illnesses, too. Because risks vary between neighborhoods, Brown recommends that those under heat advisories check the threat level in their specific zip code using the CDC's online HeatRisk tool.\n\nAs temperatures are expected to simmer into the coming weeks, many local governments -- such as Maricopa County in Arizona and Multnomah County in Oregon -- are providing cooling centers for people who may be unhoused or lack access to air conditioning. Despite the busy summer season, the National Park Service also recommends that hikers visiting heat-besieged landmarks, like Death Valley and the Grand Canyon, rethink their plans.", "source": {"uri":

More than 1,000 people died during the Haj pilgrimage last month, when temperatures reached as high as 125 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nNew Dehli endured an unprecedentedly long heatwave resulting in multiple deaths, and several tourists in Greece have died after taking hikes in the extreme heat.\n\nHere in America, the extended heatwaves and other effects of climate change are also taking their toll.\n\nHurricane Beryl tore through the Caribbean before it hit the Gulf of Mexico, killing three people in Texas and leaving over 2.5 million residents without power.\n\nIn response to the heat emergency across the country, the Biden-Harris administration has released new proposed rules for OSHA regarding worker safety, indoors as well as outdoors, during times of extreme heat.\n\nAccording to OSHA, \"Most outdoor fatalities, 50% to 70%, occur in the first few days of working in warm or hot environments because the body needs to build a tolerance to the heat gradually over time. The process of building tolerance is called heat acclimatization. Lack of acclimatization represents a major risk factor for fatal outcomes.\"\n\nThe new proposed rule would \"require employers to develop an injury and illness prevention plan to control heat hazards in workplaces affected by excessive heat.\"\n\nAmong other things, the plan would require employers to evaluate heat risks and implement requirements for drinking water, rest breaks, and control of indoor heat. It would also require a plan to protect new or returning workers unaccustomed to working in high-heat conditions.\n\nAppearing at the Washington, DC Emergency Operations Centers last week, President Joe Biden blasted Republican lawmakers who deny climate change even exists.\n\n\"It's not only outrageous, it's really stupid,\" President Biden said. The President pointed out that there are both human and financial costs from climate change, saying that weather-inflicted damage last year cost the economy $90 billion.\n\n\"More people die from extreme heat than floods, hurricanes and tornadoes combined,\" President Biden said. \"These climate-fueled extreme weather events don't just affect people's lives.

Multiple possible thunder and rain storms predicted over the next several days are not expected to cool things down, with sweltering weather continuing into next week.\n\nHowever, Dr. Andrew C. Miller, chief of emergency medicine and pediatric emergency medicine for LVHN, said the network has not seen many patients suffering specifically from heat-related illness.\n\n\"We have seen more patients with headaches, which could be a symptom of the extreme heat,\" Miller said.\n\nDr. Bryan Wilson, director of emergency medical services for St. Luke's, said they have seen some cases of heat exhaustion and heat syncope, which is fainting or dizziness caused by heat, but fortunately no cases of the more serious heat stroke as of Monday afternoon.\n\n\"They're outside exerting themselves, either exercising or just enjoying the outdoors, and they end up passing out just due to heat, from not keeping hydrated or in the case of some, enjoying the festivities over the weekend, mixing different substances with the heat, which is definitely a dangerous thing to be doing,\" Wilson said of patients that had been seen.\n\nWilson said heat injury exists on a spectrum from mild severity to life threatening, with mild dehydration on one end and heat stroke on the other end. The human body needs to remain within a certain temperature range to function properly. Sweating is the No. 1 way the human body keeps itself cool, but not drinking enough fluids, specifically water, makes it difficult for the body to regulate its internal temperature. On hot days like these, the body loses water more quickly trying to keep our bodies cool.\n\nHowever, dehydration doesn't just affect sweating; it affects numerous other bodily functions as well. Signs of dehydration in adults are extreme thirst, dark-colored urine, fatigue, headache, dizziness and confusion; in babies, symptoms include dry mouth and tongue, no tears when crying, sunken eyes or cheeks, not wetting themselves for more than three hours or a sunken soft spot on top of their skull.\n\nBesides dehydration, other early signs that the heat may be getting to you are heat cramps and heat rashes, which occur when sweat is trapped in the skin, causing potentially itchy blisters or lumps.\n\nIf steps aren't taken to cool down, drink more fluids or move to a cooler area, heat injury can progress to the next stage, heat exhaustion, which usually occurs when the body reaches a temperature between 101 and 104 degrees.\n\nHeavy sweating, increased heart rate, nausea, vomiting, muscle cramps, dizziness, lightheadedness and feeling weak are all symptoms of heat exhaustion. Another possible sign of heat exhaustion is feeling cold and clammy and skin becoming pale.\n\nPeople presenting with these symptoms should be taken to an emergency room or 911 should be called; they should also be given fluids and a cold compress, and unnecessary articles of clothing should be removed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"During dehydration, heat syncope and other initial phases of heat injury, the body's compensation mechanisms are still intact and able to function, they are just starting to get overwhelmed,\" Wilson said. \"When you get into heat exhaustion, we've really hit the max of that and without immediate treatment, it can become a life-threatening emergency.\"\n\nIf immediate steps aren't taken to cool down, heat stroke can occur. Wilson said heat stroke is the point where all the body's attempts to deal with overheating have failed.\n\n\"Heat stroke is where the body's compensation mechanisms are no longer working,\" he said. \"The body is basically beginning to shut down from the severe heat.\"\n\nHeat stroke occurs when the body's internal temperature goes above 104 degrees. A rapid, strong pulse or heart rate is typical of heat stroke, fainting or seizures are also possible, and if the body remains in this state long enough without treatment, organ damage can occur. Emergency medical attention should be sought immediately. Elderly people, especially those with multiple medical conditions, and babies are most at risk of experiencing heat stroke.\n\nWilson and Miller provided some tips on how to stay cool and avoid heat injury:\n\nWilson said parents and pet owners should limit how much time their children or pets stay outside and should never leave a child or animal alone in a car for any length of time on hot days.\n\nAnd he said people can help others avoid heat injury by being a good neighbor.\n\n\"It's highly likely that with this stretch we're going to see in the next few days that there will be some patients presenting with heat stroke,\" Wilson said. \"Something people can do to try and help their neighbors is check in on ones who are elderly or who might need extra assistance due to medical comorbidities, especially if you know they don't have air conditioning.\"", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Morning Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "leif_greiss@mcall.com", "name": "Leif Greiss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allentown,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allentown, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Allentown, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dizziness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Syncope (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headache", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Headache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehigh_Valley_Health_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lehigh Valley Health Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Luke's_University_Health_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Luke's University Health Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_syncope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat syncope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_Call", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Morning Call"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rain"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Ozone_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Ozone Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TMC-L-IronPigs-hot-02.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 480, "textEnd": 486}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

If finalized, the rule would help protect approximately 36 million workers in indoor and outdoor work settings and substantially reduce heat injuries, illnesses and deaths in the workplace.\n\nHeat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S. Excessive workplace heat can lead to heat stroke and even death. While heat hazards impact workers in many industries, workers of color have a higher likelihood of working in jobs with hazardous heat exposure.\n\n\"Every worker should come home safe and healthy at the end of the day, which is why the Biden-Harris administration is taking this significant step to protect workers from the dangers posed by extreme heat,\" said Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su. \"As the most pro-worker administration in history, we are committed to ensuring that those doing difficult work in some of our economy's most critical sectors are valued and kept safe in the workplace.\"\n\nThe proposed rule would require employers to develop an injury and illness prevention plan to control heat hazards in workplaces affected by excessive heat. Among other things, the plan would require employers to evaluate heat risks and -- when heat increases risks to workers -- implement requirements for drinking water, rest breaks and control of indoor heat. It would also require a plan to protect new or returning workers unaccustomed to working in high-heat conditions.\n\n\"Workers all over the country are passing out, suffering heat stroke and dying from heat exposure from just doing their jobs, and something must be done to protect them,\" said Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health Doug Parker. \"[This] proposal is an important next step in the process to receive public input to craft a 'win-win' final rule that protects workers while being practical and workable for employers.\"\n\nEmployers would also be required to provide training, have procedures to respond if a worker is experiencing signs and symptoms of a heat-related illness, and take immediate action to help a worker experiencing signs and symptoms of a heat emergency.\n\nThe public is encouraged to submit written comments on the rule once it is published in the Federal Register. The agency also anticipates a public hearing after the close of the written comment period. More information will be available on submitting comments when the rule is published.\n\nIn the interim, OSHA continues to direct significant existing outreach and enforcement resources to educate employers and workers and hold businesses accountable for violations of its general duty clause, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(1) and other applicable regulations. Record-breaking temperatures across the nation have increased the risks people face on the job, especially in summer months. Every year, dozens of workers die and thousands more suffer illnesses related to hazardous heat exposure that, sadly, are most often preventable.\n\nThe agency continues to conduct heat-related inspections under its National Emphasis Program - Outdoor and Indoor Heat-Related Hazards - which launched in 2022. The program inspects workplaces with the highest exposures to heat-related hazards proactively to prevent workers from suffering injury, illness or death needlessly. Since its launch, OSHA has conducted more than 5,000 federal heat-related inspections.\n\nIn addition, the agency is prioritizing programmed inspections in agricultural industries that employ temporary, non-immigrant H-2A workers for seasonal labor. These workers face unique vulnerabilities, including potential language barriers, less control over their living and working conditions, and possible lack of acclimatization, plus they are at high risk of hazardous heat exposure.", "source": {"uri": "wconline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Walls and Ceilings Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Parker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Parker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syncope (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_duty_clause", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General duty clause"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acclimatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_Safety_and_Health_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.wconline.com/ext/resources/2024/04/23/Department-Of-Labor-Logo-1170-Centered.jpg?height=418&t=1713909638&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

In Death Valley it was so hot (128 F) that helicopters couldn't fly to the rescue when the heat sickened motorcyclists. One died and another was hospitalized.\n\nColleen Reid\n\n\"More people die of heat than any other weather-related event, but it is just not publicized in the same way. We don't name heat waves like we do with hurricanes, and when you look outside there's nothing to really see so people tend not to consider heat dangerous,\" says Colleen Reid, an assistant professor of geography at CU Boulder who studies the health impacts of extreme heat. \"But it is.\"\n\nWith forecasters predicting triple-digit temperatures for three days this weekend on Colorado's Front Range, and climate change predicted to lead to hotter, longer and more frequent heat waves in the future, CU Boulder Today got Reid's take on their health impacts, who is the most vulnerable, and what people can do.\n\nWhat goes on inside your body when exposed to extreme heat?\n\nYour body tries to cool off as best as it can, so you sweat more. When you sweat, you lose electrolytes, and you need those electrolytes for lots of different bodily functions. You are also losing fluid, so you can get dehydrated, which can cause confusion and inhibit the good judgment it takes to stop and cool off. Sometimes people don't know the heat is impacting them until it's too late. Or, if they are out hiking or running, they get lost. If you can't cool off, your insides essentially cook.\n\nWe know from research that people are more likely to have heatstroke and show up in the hospital or the emergency department with electrolyte imbalance or kidney problems during a heat wave. About 1,200 people die n the U.S. each year from heat-related illness. (By comparison, about 88 perish in floods and 68 from tornadoes.)\n\nIt's staying hot for days. Is this more dangerous?\n\nThe longer the duration of a heat wave, the worse the health outcomes are. If the temperature goes up for a short period of time, we have physiological and behavioral responses that can help us cope. But when it lasts longer it can overwhelm the body's ability to handle it. Additionally, people are willing to take precautionary measures for a while but after a while they want to get on with things and just go out in the heat anyway.\n\nAre certain populations particularly vulnerable?\n\nPeople with kidney disease, as kidneys are very affected by the heat. Some prescription medications (including psychotropics, diuretics and medications for Parkinson's disease) also interfere with body temperature regulation. The elderly, as their bodies have trouble thermoregulating just due to the natural aging process. Similarly, really young children, particularly those too young to be able to use words to explain their discomfort. And, of course, anyone who does not have access to places to cool off.\n\nAre there socioeconomic factors at play here, too?\n\nYes. We know from my research and that of others that homes that have air conditioning are more likely to be homes owned by wealthier families. And even when people have an air conditioner but are struggling to pay their electric bill, they don't always turn it on. People with lower economic means also tend to live in communities that have less tree cover and fewer parks, and areas with vegetation are cooler than areas filled with concrete.\n\nIt's also been documented that even when you control for income, predominantly whiter communities have more green space, and Black and brown communities tend to have less green space. There's an environmental injustice there. Cities are getting hotter and hotter, and the most vulnerable individuals-the people least likely to have air conditioning-are also the ones least likely to have a park nearby to cool off in.\n\nKeeping cool\n\nWarning signs of heatstroke vary but may include the following, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:\n\nAn extremely high body temperature (above 103 F)Red, hot and dry skin (no sweating)Rapid, strong pulseThrobbing headacheDizzinessNauseaConfusionUnconsciousness How can individuals protect themselves?\n\nKeep an eye on the heat risk in your area and modify what you're doing, or at least when you're doing it, accordingly. If you're going to exercise outdoors, try to do it before the temperature gets too hot. As far as work goes, Colorado has a law to protect agricultural workers by requiring their employers to provide shade and water breaks. But not all outdoor workers-think about construction workers or roofers-have those laws in place.\n\nIf you must be out in the heat, drink lots of fluids, including electrolyte drinks. Don't drink alcohol or other things that dehydrate you. Seek shade whenever you can. And after you have been out in the hot sun, go somewhere cool - an air-conditioned restaurant, a friend's house with air conditioning. Being able to cool your core body temperature after being out in the sun is critically important to prevent heat stroke.\n\nHow can society prepare for a hotter future?\n\nWe need to be doing everything we can to stop emitting fossil fuels to try and slow down climate change. But that's going to take a long time to have an effect.\n\nMeantime, we need to protect people's health now and be ramping up for the fact that it's going to get worse in the future. We need to create more parks in urban areas. We need to think about shifting when the workday is and when kids practice sports in the hottest times of the year. Already, in Arizona, some construction is done at night. We need to have plans in place to help vulnerable individuals when a heat wave strikes.\n\nHow do we help the most vulnerable people?\n\nCooling centers are great, but you need to get the word out that they exist and you need to provide transportation to them, because a lot of the individuals who need them the most do not have their own vehicles. These centers also need to allow for pets, because people don't want to leave their pet suffering in the heat.\n\nThere's a lot of people who just don't want to go to a community cooling center, but if you said they could go to a movie theater or to the library or to the grocery store or a mall and just spend some time to cool their core body temperature down, they might go for that. There are also efforts to create networks where people check on their elderly neighbors who live alone and may be overheating and not realize it.\n\nMost importantly, we need to recognize that extreme heat can kill, and we need to take it seriously.\n\n/Public Release.

That's why UC San Diego scientists hosted a research roundtable on Tuesday, detailing the various aspects of rising temperatures.\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways from UCSD's panel of scientific experts is that there are serious heat inequities, especially with regards to socioeconomics and age. Low-income, poorer communities and older adults are negatively impacted by heat more than anyone else.\n\nBoth of those groups are less likely to have air conditioning, which the lack of air conditioning is a huge factor in heat-related illness.\n\nHot houses, apartments or places of residence cause all sorts of heat-related illnesses in all ages. But with seniors, heat exhaustion, strokes and falls from the heat increase when temperatures rise.\n\nLower income, under-resourced communities are often in urban areas, which can turn into heat islands with all that concentration of concrete and lack of shade radiating heat and increasing temperatures. Those increased temperatures serve to amplify heat-related problems.\n\nAnother big takeaway from UCSD's roundtable is that environmental stressors due to heat are detrimental to worker production.\n\nA recent study by the State Insurance Department estimated that extreme heat cost California $7.7 billion in the last decade. Most of that cost was in emergency health response, but a large part was also in damaged work environment and productivity loss.\n\nTo combat the latter, UCSD scientists suggested the following workplace recommendations for dealing with increasing temperatures: rest breaks, cool breaks, hydration and working in the shade.\n\nIf you have to work outside in the sun, UCSD suggested employers give employees time to get used to the heat, let their bodies assimilate to the extreme conditions with a gradual ramp up work policy.\n\nAccording to UCSD's research, if employers enact these policies, they'll see long-term benefits that actually save money, including increased worker productivity once workers get past that initial acclimation period.\n\nUCSD is also stressing that hotter heat waves are the new normal. Over the last four decades, heat waves in California have risen in frequency, intensity and duration.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, San Diego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American lower class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban heat island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acclimatization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acclimatization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural assimilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon_Cycle", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Carbon Cycle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/Cities_and_Towns_Taking_Precautions_in_Extreme_Heat-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It is republished with permission. Sign up for their newsletter here.\n\nThroughout June, six tourists died while visiting Greece during an unusually early summer heat wave. While these cases are still being investigated, authorities say that heat stress likely played a part in each of their deaths, as temperatures soared over 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nHeat-related deaths are increasingly common with climate change, and high temperatures could pose a particular risk to tourists, who are often both mentally and physically unprepared for the heat they may encounter in a new place, experts say.\n\nAs tourist tragedies stack up in warming regions around the world -- from southwest Texas to the Australian Outback -- health officials are urging visitors to change their behavior to beat the heat. But a sea change might already be happening in the tourism industry: A growing number of people are opting for \"coolcations\" instead of tropical getaways, which could have far-reaching economic impacts for some areas.\n\nA number of factors contribute to how an individual tolerates heat, including their gender, age and if they have an illness such as heart disease or diabetes.\n\nTheir ability to beat the heat can also depend on where they live and the typical temperatures they are used to. If someone is consistently exposed to high temperatures or humidity, their body adjusts at a physiological level, a process known as acclimatization. These minor changes can include increased sweating efficiency, stabilization of blood circulation and increased blood flow to the skin, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nEssentially, that means a person from Phoenix, a city that is consistently hot, might have a higher heat tolerance than a person from the chilly New England city of Providence when they are confronted with a 100-degree day (even though they are technically experiencing the same temperature). That also means that a tourist visiting Phoenix from Providence could face higher health threats from heat than a resident -- at least at first.\n\n\"It takes at least 1-2 weeks to acclimatize to heat stress. That means, a tourist who lives in a cooler climate and travels for a week-long vacation to a warmer climate or area experiencing a heat wave won't have time to acclimatize during their time in the warm area,\" Alisa Hass, a geographer at Middle Tennessee State University who studies climate impacts, told me over email.\n\nCertain health conditions such as obesity or diabetes could impair a person's ability to acclimatize, according to a 2023 study that analyzed the increasing threat for travelers to hot climate destinations. A lack of heat acclimatization may have played a role in the deaths of the tourists in Greece, Christos Giannaros, a heat expert at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, told The Associated Press.\n\nCompounding the problem, several vacation-related tendencies can increase the risk of heat-related illnesses, including drinking less water, consuming alcohol and sleeping less due to jet lag. Heat is even deadlier when coupled with strenuous outdoor activities common on vacation such as hiking. Last year, at least seven visitors at national parks across the U.S. died of heat-related illnesses from June to the end of July -- a trend that is only going to get worse as climate change accelerates, CNN reports.\n\nOn Sunday, temperatures in California's Death Valley reached 129 degrees Fahrenheit, just around 20 degrees shy of the heat required to fry an egg.\n\nYet tourists still poured into the desert valley despite the deadly heat -- or in some cases, because of it.\n\n\"I was excited it was going to be this hot,\" Drew Belt, a visitor from Tupelo, Mississippi, told The Associated Press. \"It's a once in a lifetime opportunity. Kind of like walking on Mars.\"\n\nHowever, extreme heat is not working in the favor of most top summer tourism destinations, Fast Company reports. After Europe's 2023 summer heat weave, the European Travel Commission noted a 7 percent uptick in expressions of concern about climate change from European travelers. Experts say this concern could be part of the reason tourists have shifted their travel patterns in recent years.\n\n\"Tourists are starting to travel to cooler locations, rather than warm climates like southern Italy and Greece, to avoid the heat,\" Hass told me. \"This is placing a heavy burden on communities where tourism is a large part of their economic base.\"\n\nWhile tourism dips in some hot destinations, chilly countries such as Norway and Iceland have seen a rise in visitors during the summer months -- a trend dubbed \"coolcationing,\" which Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler named one of the \"biggest travel trends to expect in 2024.\"\n\nBut some experts are not yet certain that change will stick and are urging countries with warm tourist destinations to help visitors prepare for the heat. One strategy: shifting popular events to different months. For example, in 2022, the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) rescheduled the World Cup from the summer to November and December due to Qatar's extreme heat, a first in the tournament's 89 years.\n\nAdditionally, tourism-focused industries such as hotels or resorts must raise awareness of health risks by ramping up communications around heat, whether through advisories or a simple informational flier at breakfast, Andreas Matzarakis told me. He's a professor at the University of Freiburg in Germany who studies how humans interact with the environment, including the intersection of climate change and tourism.\n\nHowever, he added that tourists themselves should also try to prepare for the heat they might face during vacation by staying indoors during peak heat and keeping hydrated.\n\n\"You're going for holidays, you will not have stress, you want to enjoy several things, but you have to keep in mind the things that you have to avoid, [including] extreme heat,\" Matzarakis said.\n\nAlong with facing the impacts of climate change, some top tourist destinations are implementing strategies to prevent it from getting worse. Beginning July 15, tourists visiting Copenhagen will be given free access to museum tours, kayak rentals and more if they demonstrate climate-friendly behavior, such as cycling or cleaning up trash, reports The New York Times.\n\nOn the stick end of the carrot-and-stick spectrum, the Hawaii legislature is considering a bill that would impose a $25 climate tax on tourists. Gov. Josh Green estimates it could bring in about $68 million annually for causes such as wildfire and flood prevention or coral reef restoration.\n\nMeanwhile, Hurricane Beryl whipped through Texas on Monday, killing at least eight people and knocking out power to nearly 3 million homes and businesses, BBC News reports. The tropical storm, which previously tore through the Caribbean, knocked down 10 transmission lines. Officials say it could take several days to put the power back on.\n\nIn other news, the Key Largo tree cactus is extinct in Florida, in what researchers say is the first local extinction of a species caused by sea-level rise in the U.S. Though scattered plots of this prickly plant still grow in the Caribbean, the species has been battered by saltwater intrusion, hurricanes and mammals munching on it in Florida in the past few decades -- representing a \"bellwether for how other low-lying coastal plants will respond to climate change,\" said botanist Jennifer Possley, lead author on a study published today that documents the population's decline.", "source": {"uri": "popsci.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Popular Science"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We are not talking about 100-degree heat like we had back in 2022 and nearly had back in June. But, this time around, the heat and humidity are more relentless.\n\nUnfortunately, we have a LONG way to go before we get any real relief.\n\nThe next several days are more of the same - high temperatures near 90 with dew points in the mid-70's, about as high as they get around here. That's rare, something that's normal down south in cities like New Orleans.\n\nRight now, there is no fresh, crisp, Canadian air mass that's on the way to save the day.\n\nLooking at the \"feels-like\" temperatures for the next seven days, you can see the Boston area never dips below 90. In fact, we expect things to get worse before they get better. It appears there will be another spike in the heat and humidity early next week.\n\nMany have asked that question. The short answer is - does it really matter?\n\nAn official heat wave in the Northeast is loosely defined as at least three consecutive days with temperatures at 90 degrees or higher.\n\nSo, going by the books, there is NO heat wave in Boston or Worcester. They haven't even hit 90 yet in this current stretch!\n\nBut, travel a bit to the north and west in Massachusetts, and temperatures have been a few degrees hotter. In places like Bedford, Fitchburg and much of the Merrimack Valley, we do in fact have an official heat wave as of Tuesday.\n\nKind of silly right? I agree. This is why I don't think we should get too caught up in declaring a heat wave or not.\n\nGo online and you will find all sorts of different definitions for a heat wave. Three days of 90-degree heat in places like Dallas or the desert Southwest might be considered a \"cooldown.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service defines it as \"a period of abnormally hot weather generally lasting more than two days... with or without high humidity.\".\n\nBasically, it is all relative. Each area of the country and the world defines their heat waves by what their typical weather or climatology is.\n\nThe bottom line - it is going to be uncomfortably hot and humid for at least the next seven days in the Boston area.\n\nThe best guess as to when this pattern breaks is probably later next week. Most models point towards a cooler and drier air mass arriving around next Thursday, July 18. That's a long way off and things could easily change.\n\nI would also anticipate that the current pattern is likely to repeat itself several times through the rest of this summer.

On a summer day, the neighborhood can feel like an oven, Day said.\n\n\"That's what all pavement and not enough trees will do for you,\" Day said. \"A lot of our rental business comes from tourists, and they come to Maine to get away from the heat. They are really surprised at how hot it gets. When it's like this, our business takes a hit.\"\n\nThe Knightville/Mill Creek section of South Portland is an urban heat island. The manmade environment of this roughly 600-acre area increases the air temperature for the 3,700 people who call it home by a state-leading 11.1 degrees, according to a nationwide heat index analysis released Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Climate Central, a New Jersey nonprofit of scientists and communicators, this seaside cluster of asphalt and cement is 11.1 degrees hotter because of its plethora of pavement and heat-absorbing buildings than if it were one big sprawling field of grass.\n\nGlobal temperatures are rising everywhere because of human-caused climate change, but the built environment is amplifying the temperatures in many cities, even in temperate climates like Maine where most people do not think of extreme heat as a major threat to the population.\n\nAccording to the latest science update to the state climate action plan, the average daily temperature in Maine will rise 2-4 degrees by 2050 and up to 10 degrees by 2100. While winters are warming fastest, our summers will be hotter and marked by more extreme heat days: the average summer high in turn-of-the-century Portland will feel like Scranton, Pennsylvania, does now, or about 8.9 degrees hotter.\n\nExtreme heat is the world's deadliest weather and climate hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. During heatwaves, the urban heat island effect worsens heat-related illness and puts vulnerable groups like the elderly, outdoor workers and children at greater risk.\n\nIt also leads to higher energy bills and strained power grids as public demand for cooling spikes.\n\nThe most concentrated heat island in Maine can be found in Portland, where the built environment amplifies the base \"field of green\" temperature anywhere from a low of 6.4 degrees in the East End and 7.3 degrees in Deering Center to 10.5 in the Old Port and 10.8 degrees in East Bayside.\n\n\"A lot of our older U.S. cities were built to be warm, built to keep heat in, built to keep ourselves warm, but now we're in a new paradigm where we want to keep heat out,\" said Jen Brady, Climate Central's senior data analyst. \"It's not something we can shift overnight, but there are things we can do.\"\n\nThat includes planting more trees, especially along paved streets; planting rooftop gardens for shade and temperature reduction; replacing dark roofs with roofs made of highly reflective materials; and replacing hot concrete or asphalt pavements with pavements of reflective or permeable materials.\n\nPortland is taking steps to mitigate the heat island effect, Sustainability Director Troy Moon said.\n\n\"Addressing urban heat is an important part of our climate adaptation strategy,\" Moon said. \"Our parks department is currently implementing a program to plant 120 trees in the Bayside neighborhood, which lacks the extensive tree canopy found in other parts of the city.\"\n\nThe city is also proposing a citywide overlay zone to address heat by requiring new developments to incorporate more trees and green space, incorporate pavement that reflects rather than absorbs heat, and have roofs that reflect heat or have solar panels installed, Moon said.\n\nThe urban heat island index developed by Climate Central uses a model developed by three Italian architects that was published in the October 2020 edition of Scientific Reports that quantifies the factors that cause developed areas to heat up.\n\nThe model uses data on the distribution of different land cover types in each census tract, from green space to paved areas, along with data on building height, population density and industry to estimate urban heat island intensity.\n\nIt does not account for the cooling impact of sea breezes, which can make a significant difference in coastal communities at certain times of the day, Brady said. At other times of the day, however, when there is no wind, the ocean will reflect sunlight and raise the temperature.\n\nBack at Lighthouse Bikes, Day longs for a Knightville-Mill Creek tree-planting campaign that could provide some respite to her shade-starved neighborhood. But the extreme heat does make for a compelling climate change anecdote for her shop's guided bike tours.\n\nWhen leading tours, the Peaks Island resident likes to point out areas along the nearby coastal bike path that illustrate Maine's changing climate, like where king tides boosted by sea level rise have overrun the pavement or a public art installation naming local species at risk from rising seas.\n\n\"But on the really hot days, when the people on our tours can't believe it's this hot even in a cold state like Maine, the cyclists can feel the heat,\" Day said. \"It's not good for business, but it certainly makes its point. It's not supposed to be this hot.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island",

In such tough conditions, experts advise people to avoid staying in the sun for too long and to wear loose clothing, drink plenty of fluids, limit activity to early morning or evening, and be on guard for symptoms of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.\n\nBut even with those precautions, people in fields ranging from public safety to roofers must go to work daily and endure the heat.\n\nMarion County Fire Rescue sets heat index limits for training and institutes necessary work and rest cycles for employees who are working at emergency scenes.\n\nAt a recent training session, trainees performed exercises while carrying 75 pounds of bunker gear and breathing apparatus.\n\nOne exercise known as \"confinement and entanglement training,\" overseen by MCFR trainer Paul Chamberlain, involved crawling through a tunnel inside of a metal cargo shipping container while dragging a simulated victim dummy to safety.\n\nVisitors are cautioned not to touch the hot metal walls of the cargo container.\n\nMCFR firefighter/EMT Andrew Majoros said hydration and rehabilitation breaks are key elements when working at emergency scenes.\n\nRoofing is another trade where type of clothing, hats, hydration and scheduling are factors in Florida summers.\n\nJason Gambel with ISC Contracting Roofing & Building follows precautions and schedules jobs early.

It says symptoms of heat stroke are dry/clammy skin and losing consciousness.\n\nFDOH literature states that a person suffering from heat exhaustion should be cooled with wet cloths and sip water and seek medical aid if symptoms worsen. When a person is suffering from heat stroke, 911 should be called and the individual should not be given anything to drink.\n\nMore information about health and hot temperatures can be found at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at https://www.cdc.gov/extreme-heat/about/index.html and https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/userfiles/works/pdfs/2017-126.pdf\n\nThe CDC recommends those working in the heat drink 8 ounces of water every 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nFirefighter EMT Majoros summed up how it feels to work an active scene in full gear when the outside temperature is over 90 degrees.\n\n\"Hot,\" he said.\n\nBe cautious in the ocean: In a summer of sharks, these Florida beaches have seen the fewest shark bites of all time\n\nMore weather: Fed up with sticky summer heat?

For much of the U.S., this summer's forecast will keep residents under the comforting, cool stream of their air-conditioning units.\n\nBut staying comfortable during harsh summers comes at an increasingly steep cost for consumers. In-unit air conditioning can rack up the electricity bill, forcing some families to choose between food and protection from the heat.\n\nThese are the hidden costs of staying cool during heat waves:\n\nExtreme heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths in the U.S., with more than 1,220 people succumbing to high temperatures every year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nExtreme heat has significant economic consequences, as well. In 2021, more than 2.5 billion hours of labor were lost due to heat exposure in the U.S. agriculture, construction, manufacturing, and service sectors.\n\nIn California, where temperatures have broken the 100-degree mark this week, excessive heat has cost the state billions.\n\nA recent report from the California Department of Insurance tallies the total economic loss from extreme heat events in the past decade. Between 2013 and 2022, extreme heat cost the state $7.7 billion in lost wages, decreased productivity, agricultural and manufacturing disruptions, power outages, and damages to infrastructure.\n\nA separate report from the Center for American Progress found that health care costs from extreme heat amount to an estimated $1 billion every summer. With prolonged periods of excessive heat during summer months, the rate of heat-related illnesses rose. This resulted in more emergency department visits and admissions to hospitals, according to the report.\n\n\"Extrapolated nationally, heat event days would be responsible for almost 235,000 emergency department visits and more than 56,000 hospital admissions for heat-related or heat-adjacent illness, adding approximately $1 billion in health care costs each summer,\" the report stated.\n\nThe average cost of electricity bills in the summer has increased by 51% from $476 in 2014 to an estimated $719 in 2024, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state governments in federal programs to help low-income families pay water, heating, and cooling bills.\n\nThis summer, electricity bills are expected to total $719 each month from June through September. That average is up from $661 over the same four-month stretch last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association and the Center for Energy Poverty, and Climate.\n\nLow-income families who can least afford higher bills will be hit hardest, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, told USA TODAY last month.\n\n\"The dangers of extreme heat leave low-income families at heightened risk, due to lack of access to affordable summer cooling, increasing electric costs and cutbacks in funding\" of federal aid programs, Wolfe said.\n\nSome cities and regions of the U.S. are still ill-prepared for heat waves.\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest and the Bay Area, for instance, cities haven't historically had to plan for extreme heat because they haven't often broken 90 degrees. As a result, cities like Seattle, Portland and San Francisco have low rates of in-home air conditioning units, leaving many residents to struggle during ever-increasing heat waves driven by climate change.\n\nIf you live somewhere without air conditioning, experts recommend opening your windows at night and closing them before the afternoon heats up.\n\nTypically, the peak hours when most areas see the hottest weather is from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. That's when it's most important to try to keep cool, even if that means finding refuge in a business or restaurant or carrying around a fan or spray bottle to cool off.\n\nFred Campbell, a professor at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, previously told USA TODAY that having multiple fans directly blowing on you can make a big difference when it comes to regulating your temperature. This is especially helpful for older Americans and young children who can't regulate their temperature as well.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

This can prevent the body from cooling down, increasing the risk of heat cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke. Dr. Jesse Bracamonte, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says the extreme heat and high humidity can be a dangerous mix.\n\n\"High heat and high humidity can place one at risk for serious illness if people aren't careful. The heat can affect people's bodies by increasing the core body temperature and ability to sweat, and cause dehydration that can cause further medical problems and ensuing issues, and eventually can lead to heat exhaustion, in some cases, severe heat illness, known as heatstroke,\" says Dr. Bracamonte.\n\nHeat-related illnesses can be serious. They include heat rash, heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heatstroke.\n\n\"Illness can be something mild, such as heat cramps, which is usually the first stage consisting of cramping and abdominal pain in some instances. Then it can progress to heat exhaustion, which is nausea, filling inability to cool, increased warmth, cramping, dehydration, or mild dehydration,\" he says. \"And that can become severe, and that's known as heatstroke, which can cause disorientation, confusion, the ability to cool yourself, nausea and vomiting.\"\n\nHeat exhaustion happens when the body loses too much water or salt from heavy sweating or dehydration, usually after being active in the heat. Heatstroke is more serious and happens when the body overheats and can't cool down.\n\nSeeking care promptly for heat-related illnesses is crucial. You should try to cool down quickly, drink cool fluids and stay out of the heat until your symptoms get better.\n\n\"If you have symptoms of heat cramps or heat exhaustion, it's important to stay cool,\" says Dr. Bracamonte. Seek a cool, shaded place, go indoors, and drink fluids. Consider sports drinks containing electrolyte-hydrating fluids as well -- just watch for heavy sugar content.\n\nIf you think someone has heat exhaustion, act fast to prevent heatstroke - which can be life-threatening.\n\nSigns of heatstroke include:\n\nIf you think someone has heatstroke, call 911 or your local emergency services immediately.\n\nSome things can make people more sensitive to heat:\n\nHeat and humidity can pose health risks, so it's important to take precautions to stay safe. Keep cool, stay hydrated, and stay informed to protect yourself and others when it's hot outside.\n\n\"Be careful with doing new activities that can get you dehydrated quickly, so acclimate to the heat and don't go out during the warmest parts of the day. Try to find the coolest parts of the day to keep yourself healthy and away from heat-related illness,\" says Dr. Bracamonte.\n\nUnderstanding the risks associated with high heat and humidity, recognizing the symptoms of heat-related illnesses, and knowing how to respond can help prevent serious health issues.", "source": {"uri": "yourislandnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Island News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_cramps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat cramps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehydration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dehydration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body_temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human body temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_Clinic", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayo Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cramp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miliaria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miliaria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abdominal pain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salt (chemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://yourislandnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Extreme-temps-affect-your-health.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4196078431372549, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Ron DeSantis this spring signed a controversial law barring Florida local government from imposing such requirements on businesses.\n\nThe federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration on Tuesday released a proposed rule that would require employers to provide such things as water and rest breaks when temperatures top certain thresholds.\n\n\"Workers all over the country are passing out, suffering heat stroke and dying from heat exposure from just doing their jobs, and something must be done to protect them,\" Douglas L. Parker, assistant secretary for occupational safety and health, said in a prepared statement. \"Today's proposal is an important next step in the process to receive public input to craft a 'win-win' final rule that protects workers while being practical and workable for employers.\"\n\nThe issue of requiring Florida businesses to provide heat protection for workers drew fierce debate during this year's legislative session.\n\nDeSantis in April signed a bill (HB 433) that includes preventing local governments from requiring heat-exposure protections for workers. That part of the bill came after the Miami-Dade County Commission last year considered a proposal to require construction and agriculture companies to take steps such as ensuring that workers have access to water and giving them 10-minute breaks in the shade every two hours when the heat index is at least 95 degrees, according to a House staff analysis.\n\nSupporters of the bill, including groups such as the Florida Chamber of Commerce and Associated Industries of Florida, said it would prevent a patchwork of regulations and that employers already face requirements to protect workers from heat-related injuries. But opponents said workers need additional protections as they earn livings in Florida's sometimes-stifling heat.\n\nThe federal government does not have specific standards for hazardous heat conditions, but OSHA can act against businesses through what is known as a \"general duty clause\" of a workplace-safety law, according to a background document posted Tuesday on the agency's website. The proposed rule seeks to provide specific standards.\n\n\"OSHA's efforts to protect employees from hazardous heat conditions using the general duty clause, although important, have limitations leaving many workers vulnerable to heat-related hazards,\" the 437-page background document said.\n\nThe proposed rule, in part, would require employers to develop plans to prevent heat-related illnesses or injuries and monitor heat conditions.\n\nWhen conditions reach what is described as an \"initial heat trigger,\" such as a heat index of 80 degrees, employers would be required to take steps including providing cool drinking water and break areas. When conditions reach a \"high heat trigger,\" such as a heat index of 90 degrees, they would be required to take steps such as providing mandatory rest breaks of 15 minutes every two hours.\n\nIf the proposed rule is ultimately approved, it would apply to about 36 million workers in outdoor and indoor workplaces, according to OSHA. The proposal will be published in the Federal Register, starting a public-comment period before the agency can finalize a rule.\n\nOSHA last week announced it had cited Guerrero Ag LLC, an Arcadia-based labor contractor, after a 41-year-old worker collapsed in December 2023 while harvesting oranges. The worker, who died after being hospitalized, had symptoms consistent with a heat stroke, the agency said in a news release.", "source": {"uri": "thewestsidegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Westside Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carma_henry@thewestsidegazette.com", "name": "Carma Henry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_L._Parker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas L.

Shoaf, released the following statement in response to the release of a new proposed federal heat safety rule by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration.\n\n\"The proposed new federal heat safety rule codifies many of the heat safety practices the construction industry already uses to protect workers,\" Shoaf said. \"Those measures, which broadly fall into the categories of water, rest, shade and training, were crafted by construction firms as part of their general duty obligations to protect workers and keep them healthy.\n\n\"It is disappointing, however, that federal officials have not addressed the disparate impacts of heat in various parts of the country,\" Shoaf added. \"In short, the impacts on worker safety of a 90-degree day in Mississippi are different than a 90-degree day in Alaska. The final version of the rule should take into account regional differences in weather patterns.\n\n\"The proposal also lacks any emphasis on the role workers must play to protect themselves from the heat,\" Shoaf continued. \"Heat safety does not begin at the job site, and the rule should include measures designed to reinforce the role workers play in protecting themselves. These measures include self-hydrating, understanding how common health conditions and medications contribute to heat stress and avoiding the excessive consumption of drinks containing caffeine and alcohol during periods of extreme heat, all of which the agency is aware.\n\n\"We appreciate the opportunities we have had to help federal safety officials craft their proposed new heat safety rule,\" Shoaf said. \"That collaboration is one reason why so many of the measures outlined in the proposed new rule track with industry practices that are already in place. We are in the process of reviewing all the details of the new proposal with our members to ensure we can provide feedback to agency officials.\n\n\"Overall, this proposed new rule provides a starting point for creating measures to protect workers that are based on what the industry is already doing,\" Shoaf added. \"We look forward to working with federal officials to craft a final rule that includes effective measures for firms and workers to follow. That final rule should also avoid the kind of one-size-all approaches that will do more to hamstring firms than to protect workers.\"", "source": {"uri": "wconline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Walls and Ceilings Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Construction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_safety_and_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Occupational safety and health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caffeine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caffeine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Government Agencies", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Occupational_Health_and_Safety/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Occupational Health and Safety/Organizations", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 24}], "image": "https://www.wconline.com/ext/resources/WC/2020/AGC-logo.png?height=418&t=1622824019&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Srinagar has recorded its hottest July day in over two decades at 35.6 degrees Celsius, a temperature last seen in 1999. In response, the health department issued advisories and the school education department announced a 10-day summer vacation.\n\nMeanwhile, in the United States, heat alerts have been issued for 26 states from Washington to Florida, during 4th of July holiday, affecting over 120 million people. Particularly severe conditions on the West Coast have already claimed lives, including a tragic incident involving a 10-year-old boy in Phoenix.\n\nCalifornia faces one of its worst heat waves in 18 years, exacerbating wildfire risks and prompting massive evacuations. The Thompson Fire in Butte County has already consumed over 3,500 acres, threatening thousands of structures and 28,00 people under evacuation order.\n\nThis pattern of extreme heat is not confined to Kashmir or California. In June 2024, an intense heat wave affected over 100 million people in the eastern United States, raising concerns about flash droughts impacting agriculture, water resources, and energy supplies.\n\nGlobally, 2024 has witnessed record-breaking heat waves in Mexico, Central America, Saudi Arabia, Greece, and India, leading to severe health risks, water shortages, and fatalities.\n\nUnprecedented heat spell\n\nIn South and Southeast Asia, early heat waves have caused nearly three dozen deaths, school closures, and significant crop failures. India has experienced temperatures over 44 degrees Celsius, with some regions reaching nearly 46 degrees for weeks.\n\nTemperature in Delhi soared to its highest-ever level one day in May at 52.3 degrees Celsius. Other Asian countries like Bangladesh, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam have also suffered from unprecedented heat, impacting millions of lives.\n\nClimate change is a significant factor driving these extreme weather events. The global climate is currently about 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit (1.2 degrees Celsius) warmer than pre-industrial levels due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. This warming has led to more frequent and intense heat waves occurring outside the typical summer peak, a trend that is expected to continue.\n\nGet exclusive content with Gulf News WhatsApp channel Record-high temperatures\n\nScientists have linked the rise in temperatures to the El Ni\u00f1o climate pattern and decades of global heating. Predictions indicate that by 2030, 4 billion people will face extreme heat for at least a month annually, a number expected to rise to 5 billion by mid-century. The current conditions mark the 12th consecutive month of record-high global temperatures.\n\nThe heat waves have highlighted the growing global divide in experiencing climate change. Wealthier regions might enjoy milder winters, but poorer countries face deadly summer heat. In parts of the Middle East, Pakistan, and India, high humidity combined with extreme temperatures can be particularly lethal, especially in areas with limited access to air conditioning and water.\n\nThis divide is evident in the varying impacts on health, economy, and daily life. Heat waves increase the risk of respiratory conditions, cardiovascular issues, and preterm births. Economically, they reduce workforce productivity, especially among outdoor workers in agriculture and the unorganized sector.\n\nFor instance, a peer-reviewed study in 2023 has warned that extreme heat could reduce outdoor working capacity by 15%, potentially lowering the quality of life for millions and causing a 2.8% decline in India's GDP by 2050.\n\nMore by Prof Ashok Swain Rahul Gandhi's leadership revives secularism in India Conflicts and climate change aggravate world's hunger crisis G7 leaders confront global challenges together Limiting future warming\n\nDespite the dire situation, there are some hopes to mitigate future warming. The United State's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. Advancements in renewable energy, heat pumps, and geothermal systems offer cost-effective cooling and reduced emissions.\n\nGlobal efforts to reduce fossil fuel use can limit future warming and its associated risks, providing health, economic, and environmental benefits.\n\nPublic health experts emphasize the need for better resilience strategies, particularly for vulnerable communities. The 2024 World Risk Poll Resilience Index highlights the need to empower women and improve resilience among poorer households to enhance climate adaptation efforts.\n\nPolitical developments with the rise of far-right forces in the West show limited focus on these issues, with green policies facing backlash in Europe and concerns about the potential return of former President Trump in the United States.\n\nGlobal leaders, including UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, warn that urgent action is needed to address the escalating climate crisis. The climate alarm bells are ringing, yet the response remains inadequate.\n\nThe current heat waves around the globe underscore the devastating impact of climate change. As global temperatures continue to rise, the frequency and intensity of such extreme weather events are likely to increase, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.\n\nIt is imperative for global leaders to take immediate and decisive action to mitigate the effects of climate change, protect public health, and build resilient communities capable of withstanding future climate challenges. The future of our planet and the well-being of billions depend on the actions we take today.\n\nAshok Swain\n\n@ProfAshokSwain\n\nAshok Swain is a professor of peace and conflict research at Uppsala

As a result, extreme heat becomes so much more concentrated in cities compared with rural surrounding areas.\n\n\"As outside air cools down, that very dense material that's absorbed the heat starts to re-release that heat into the ambient environment,\" said Vivek Shandas, professor of climate adaptation at Portland State University. \"Those heat islands actually end up staying hotter for longer periods of time in the city.\"\n\nChicago, Philadelphia, Houston, San Diego, Dallas and Los Angeles are home to at least 1 million people who experience 8F of additional heat, with New York City having the highest disparity of 9.65F. That means that, on average, a 90F day in New York City could have been only 80F if the built environment didn't have heat-amplifying characteristics.\n\n\"We built a lot of these older cities to keep us warm. But now we're dealing with heat, and that's the challenge,\" Brady said. \"In the cities, you have more surface to retain all this heat and hold on to it.\"\n\nFor some 145,000 people who live in the most severe urban heat islands, built infrastructure can elevate temperatures by 12F or more. These disparities can be felt from one part of the city to another, with people of color and low-income residents bearing the brunt of heat.\n\nIn the 1930's, a federal policy known as \"redlining\" delineated neighborhoods where people of color lived as \"too risky\".\n\n\"Those areas really got forgotten by a lot of the planners, and as their land values went down, big developments like the freeways or big box stores would go to those areas,\" said Shandas. \"What we end up seeing is this vicious cycle of how a federally codified policy from the 1930s has a long legacy effect to what we're seeing today. The communities that live around these areas are the ones who face it worst when a heatwave comes through.\"\n\nSome of the ways to reduce the impact of heat include planting trees and shrubs along streets and roadways. Converting asphalt-heavy infrastructure like parking lots into parks and green spaces can be essential in creating additional shade, while allowing the sun's radiation to dissipate more quickly.\n\n\"What we're finding is that a neighborhood that has a larger amount of trees tends to be about 15 degrees cooler than a neighborhood that doesn't have that same tree canopy,\" Shandas said.\n\nPainting roadways and rooftops a lighter color can also help with absorbing less heat.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The first, perhaps most critical phase was for workers forced to be outdoors in the heat.\n\nFor journeyman carpenter Gabriel Fore, this second workday in the heat, well, he's seen worse.\n\n\"Yesterday was hotter,\" Fore said.\n\nStill, he says he is well versed in what to do when the temperature soars, as it has for the last few days.\n\n\"Drink lots of water,\" he advised. \"Just push through it.

When the thermometer hits 90 degrees, employees must get 10-minute cool-down breaks every two hours. When it rises to 100 degrees, the number of breaks increases to 15-minute pauses, every hour.\n\nEmployers must also provide shade and at least a quart of cool water every hour for every employee. But some people work in oppressive heat indoors.\n\n\"Well, we're working on that,\" said Matt Ross, an LnI spokesman. He says the greatest urgency was protecting outdoor workers in the heat. But now the agency is shifting to those who earn their living inside.\n\n\"As far as what the rules for indoor workers will look like,\" he said, \"we work really closely with workers, advocates, community and businesses to make sure our rules are both protective and feasible and able to be implemented.\"\n\nAs for Gabriel Fore, he says he moved here from California. So he'll take the heat around here anytime.\n\n\"I won't go back to California, either,\" he said. \"Too expensive and too hot.\"\n\nLnI says workers who feel their employer is not complying with the new heat rules may complain online or in person anonymously, too.\n\nAs for new heat rules for indoor workers, Matt Ross says that work is supposed to get started in about a year.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journeyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpentry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carpentry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermometer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermometer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ross_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Ross (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking_Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Rethinking Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Plumbing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Plumbing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/kiro_cox_articles_720/3bee769016dab2694a3237620615799f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

But forecasters say it will begin to shift eastward by the end of the week.\n\n\"Until it does, we're going to be hot, hot, hot,\" said Dan Berc, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Las Vegas.\n\nPotentially record-breaking and dangerous highs are still forecast across much of the region through Friday.\n\nTemperatures in Lancaster and Palmdale soared to more than 110 degrees Tuesday, the cities' sixth consecutive day at or above that mark -- doubling the length of the prior record. Barstow-Daggett Airport in the Mojave Desert again tied its all-time high at 118 degrees on Tuesday, and several locations set record highs for July 9, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThat pattern will likely continue for the next few days.\n\n\"Stay cool, stay hydrated, stay informed,\" the weather service warned, urging residents to take the extreme heat seriously. \"Anyone overcome by heat should be moved to a cool and shaded location. Heat stroke is an emergency!\"\n\nExcessive heat warnings across southwestern California remain in effect through Thursday night, with highs up to 108 possible for much of the Inland Empire and coastal valleys and mountains.\n\nIn Northern California, most heat advisories will remain in effect slightly longer, through Friday, with the Bay Area mountains, Sacramento Valley and surrounding areas bracing for a second peak of heat Thursday and \"widespread major to locally extreme heat risk anticipated,\" forecasters warned.\n\nParts of the state, including the Antelope Valley and much of the San Joaquin Valley, will remain under severe heat warnings through Saturday.\n\n\"A cooling trend is expected by Friday and the weekend but temperatures will remain well above normal inland,\"

Upper 80-degree temperatures could continue into Monday.\n\nWarm overnight temperatures mean little recovery time for people planning to spend a lot of time outside this weekend, Kruk said.

People are advised by the National Weather Service to take \"extreme caution\" when heat index values are above 90 degrees. Effects like heat stroke, heat cramps or heat exhaustion are possible either with prolonged exposure or physical activity in high temperatures.\n\nIs the heat an effect of Tropical Depression Beryl?\n\nNo. As the storm moves northeast across the United States, some parts of southeastern Wisconsin may see some rain from the storm, which began as a hurricane in the Caribbean Sea last week and made landfall in Texas early Monday.

said in a post on X the \"dangerous heat\" was expected to remain in the western part of the country for the rest of the week before moving eastward over the weekend, warning \"the persistent and record-breaking heat is extremely dangerous to those without access to cooling.\"\n\nAmong places that saw records shattered was Las Vegas, Nevada, which recorded its all-time high temperature of 120 degrees Fahrenheit on Sunday.\n\nIn Texas, the White House declared a federal emergency after the storm Beryl had left some 2 million without power as of Tuesday evening.\n\n\"The greatest concern right now is the power outages and extreme heat that is impacting Texans,\" President Joe Biden said in a statement.\n\nMeanwhile the southeastern United States and East Coast saw sweltering temperatures of their own, with heat advisories and excessive heat warnings in effect from Florida to Massachusetts.\n\nThe heat has been directly attributed to several deaths along the US West Coast.\n\nIn Death Valley, California, on Saturday, a motorcyclist died of suspected heat exposure and another was hospitalized, according to National Park Service officials.\n\nThe area, known as one of the hottest places on Earth, recorded a temperature of 128F .\n\nFurther north, four men in the Portland, Oregon area have died since Friday as a result of heat-related illnesses, according to local newspaper The Oregonian.\n\nThough the Pacific Northwest is known as being generally more temperate than the deserts in the US Southwest, temperatures there remained elevated Tuesday after the Oregon capital Salem hit a daily record of 103 degrees over the weekend.\n\n\"This is a record-breaking heat wave,\" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, said during an online news conference over the weekend.\n\nSome people in California, he said, had seen \"not only the hottest day they've ever experienced but also the hottest day that their parents or grandparents ever would have experienced.\"\n\nThe high temperatures also contributed to extreme fire conditions in California, where thousands of acres burned in active wildfires up and down the state.\n\nNorthwest of Santa Barbara, the Lake Fire burned nearly 27,000 acres , prompting evacuations and road closures Tuesday.\n\nThe heat wave comes in the aftermath of the Earth's hottest June ever recorded, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nRecurring heat waves are a marker of climate change caused by humanity's use of fossil fuels, according to

On a summer day, the neighborhood can feel like an oven, Day said.\n\n\"That's what all pavement and not enough trees will do for you,\" Day said. \"A lot of our rental business comes from tourists, and they come to Maine to get away from the heat. They are really surprised at how hot it gets. When it's like this, our business takes a hit.\"\n\nThe Knightville/Mill Creek section of South Portland is an urban heat island. The manmade environment of this roughly 600-acre area increases the air temperature for the 3,700 people who call it home by a state-leading 11.1 degrees, according to a nationwide heat index analysis released Wednesday.\n\nAccording to Climate Central, a New Jersey nonprofit of scientists and communicators, this seaside cluster of asphalt and cement is 11.1 degrees hotter because of its plethora of pavement and heat-absorbing buildings than if it were one big sprawling field of grass.\n\nGlobal temperatures are rising everywhere because of human-caused climate change, but the built environment is amplifying the temperatures in many cities, even in temperate climates like Maine where most people do not think of extreme heat as a major threat to the population.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the latest science update to the state climate action plan, the average daily temperature in Maine will rise 2-4 degrees by 2050 and up to 10 degrees by 2100. While winters are warming fastest, our summers will be hotter and marked by more extreme heat days: the average summer high in turn-of-the-century Portland will feel like Scranton, Pennsylvania, does now, or about 8.9 degrees hotter.\n\nExtreme heat is the world's deadliest weather and climate hazard, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. During heatwaves, the urban heat island effect worsens heat-related illness and puts vulnerable groups like the elderly, outdoor workers and children at greater risk.\n\nIt also leads to higher energy bills and strained power grids as public demand for cooling spikes.\n\nCity arborist Mark Reiland evaluates the root structure of a tree about to be planted in the Bayside neighborhood of Portland in June. It is one step the city is taking to reduce the heat island effect in a neighborhood that lacks an extensive tree canopy. Photo courtesy of the City of Portland\n\nThe most concentrated heat island in Maine can be found in Portland, where the built environment amplifies the base \"field of green\" temperature anywhere from a low of 6.4 degrees in the East End and 7.3 degrees in Deering Center to 10.5 in the Old Port and 10.8 degrees in East Bayside.\n\n\"A lot of our older U.S. cities were built to be warm, built to keep heat in, built to keep ourselves warm, but now we're in a new paradigm where we want to keep heat out,\" said Jen Brady, Climate Central's senior data analyst. \"It's not something we can shift overnight, but there are things we can do.\"\n\nThat includes planting more trees, especially along paved streets; planting rooftop gardens for shade and temperature reduction; replacing dark roofs with roofs made of highly reflective materials; and replacing hot concrete or asphalt pavements with pavements of reflective or permeable materials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPortland is taking steps to mitigate the heat island effect, Sustainability Director Troy Moon said.\n\n\"Addressing urban heat is an important part of our climate adaptation strategy,\" Moon said. \"Our parks department is currently implementing a program to plant 120 trees in the Bayside neighborhood, which lacks the extensive tree canopy found in other parts of the city.\"\n\nThe city is also proposing a citywide overlay zone to address heat by requiring new developments to incorporate more trees and green space, incorporate pavement that reflects rather than absorbs heat, and have roofs that reflect heat or have solar panels installed, Moon said.\n\nRelated Report lays out Maine's latest climate projections. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe urban heat island index developed by Climate Central uses a model developed by three Italian architects that was published in the October 2020 edition of Scientific Reports that quantifies the factors that cause developed areas to heat up.\n\nThe model uses data on the distribution of different land cover types in each census tract, from green space to paved areas, along with data on building height, population density and industry to estimate urban heat island intensity.\n\nIt does not account for the cooling impact of sea breezes, which can make a significant difference in coastal communities at certain times of the day, Brady said. At other times of the day, however, when there is no wind, the ocean will reflect sunlight and raise the temperature.\n\nBack at Lighthouse Bikes, Day longs for a Knightville-Mill Creek tree-planting campaign that could provide some respite to her shade-starved neighborhood. But the extreme heat does make for a compelling climate change anecdote for her shop's guided bike tours.\n\nWhen leading tours, the Peaks Island resident likes to point out areas along the nearby coastal bike path that illustrate Maine's changing climate, like where king tides boosted by sea level rise have overrun the pavement or a public art installation naming local species at risk from rising seas.\n\n\"But on the really hot days, when the people on our tours can't believe it's this hot even in a cold state like Maine, the cyclists can feel the heat,\" Day said. \"It's not good for business, but it certainly makes its point. It's not supposed to be this hot.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Report lays out Maine's latest climate projections. Here's what you need to know.

On Sunday, Las Vegas posted its highest temperature on record, soaring to 120 degrees.\n\nThrough the rest of the workweek, the most extreme heat will continue to plague the western United States. On Wednesday, pockets of record heat are predicted for parts of Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, California, Nevada and Arizona.\n\nLas Vegas is forecast to reach 119 both Wednesday and Thursday. If it weren't for Sunday's high of 120, these would be all-time highs. If Sin City's high reaches at least 115 Wednesday, it will mark a record fifth straight day that hot.\n\nThe zone from Las Vegas into parts of Southern California and Arizona are expected to feel high temperatures top 120 degrees through Friday.\n\nTriple-digit heat will also continue to roast regions as far north as western Canada, including much of eastern Washington State, the Snake River Valley in Idaho and large parts of the Great Basin.\n\nHighs of at least 110 degrees are forecast for much of California's Central Valley for the rest of the workweek.\n\nBy the weekend, it should stay hot but probably below record levels in most areas because of an increase in moisture from the south tied to the onset of monsoon season in the Southwest.\n\nHowever, the heat dome -- an intense zone of high pressure responsible for the excessively high temperatures -- is forecast to mostly remain in place.\n\nIn the eastern United States, an expected cool front will allow heat to ease somewhat on Thursday and Friday. However, the heat will attempt to rebuild over the weekend and next week.\n\nSince July began, hundreds of heat records have been set in the United States, many in the West. Through July 9, record highs have outnumbered records lows by nearly a factor of 20, according to data compiled by the Southeast Regional Climate Center. There were about 300 heat records set daily on July 5, 6 and 7.\n\nMany locations in the West have set at least four calendar-day record highs during the first nine days of the month. They include Reno, Nev.; Las Vegas; Bishop and Redding in California; and Portland and Medford in Oregon.\n\nAll-time highs have been set almost daily at least somewhere in the West. On Tuesday, the high of 118 in Barstow, Calif. -- about midway between Los Angeles and Las Vegas -- tied its all-time high for a third straight day.\n\nSeveral other locations have set all-time highs, including Palm Springs, Calif. (124 on Friday); Redding, Calif., (119 on Saturday) and Las Vegas.\n\nDeath Valley hit 129 degrees on Sunday -- one of its highest temperatures on record -- and has observed a seven-day average high temperature of 126.3.\n\nIn the East, Raleigh, N.C., hit 106 degrees on Friday, also an all-time high.\n\nThe persistence of the heat has been particularly remarkable. Many locations have reported one of their hottest weeks (seven consecutive days) on record, including:\n\nWashington, D.C., has posted its fourth-hottest five-day stretch on record, with an average temperature of 88.7 degrees.\n\nScientific studies have shown human-caused climate change is increasing the intensity, frequency and size of heat waves.\n\nAccording to the Climate Shift Index from Climate Central, a science communications firm, human-caused climate change has made recent high temperatures four or five times more likely in much of the West and two to three times more probable in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.\n\nThe planet has an ongoing streak of 13 straight record warm months while the United States is having its second-warmest year on record to date.", "source": {"uri":

Other forecasters are calling for the heat to continue into late next week.\n\nThe Inquirer analyzed 50 years of daily weather data for Philadelphia International Airport stretching from 1974 through this week. By Thursday, the last expected day of what should be a seven day heat wave, Philadelphia will have already seen 19 days of temperatures reaching 90 degrees or above.\n\nThat would place it among the top three years for such a heat spell through July 11.\n\nPut another way, as of Thursday, we'll have seen as many 90 or higher degree days as 14 other full years.\n\nAn early heat wave helped make the month of June the fourth warmest stretching all the way back to 1872. Of the 15 warmest Junes in Philly over that extended period, nine have occurred since 2001.\n\n\" READ MORE: What one of Philly's warmest Junes on record may mean for the rest of summer\n\nThe data show that 90 degree days are common enough in September. Some 90 degree days have come as early as April and stretched into October.\n\nBut July acts like a heat-seeking missile.\n\nShel Winkle, a Texas-based meteorologist with Climate Central, a nonprofit that includes scientists who analyze climate trends, said the meteorological summer of June, July, and August began with a swelter.\n\n\"For the Northeast, the heat started early so you didn't get a chance to acclimate,\" Winkle said. \"It was a run up to late summertime heat right all at once and it was extended.\"\n\nWinkle noted the difference between weather, which includes short term patterns, and climate change, which is marked by long term patterns. Summers are supposed to be hot, Winkle noted, and some will be cooler year-to-year. But overtime, he said, they are proving hotter for longer periods than in past decades.\n\n\"What we know in a warming climate is that these heat domes and these heat waves become more intense so temperatures are hotter,\" Winkle said. \"They become longer in duration, like what you're dealing with this summer.\"\n\nWinkle said that 50 years ago, a typical Philly summer saw about 20 days above 90 degrees for June, July and August, representing about 22% of the days. Now, about 32 days over the summer are 90 degrees or more days, representing about 35% of days.\n\nThat's unwelcome news for people who live in parts of the city where temperatures can be 10, 15, or even 20 degrees hotter than others because of the urban heat island effect.\n\n\" READ MORE: These Philly neighborhoods get the worst of the summer heat\n\nAccording to an analysis by Climate Central, more than half a million people in Philadelphia live in neighborhoods affected by an urban heat island effect of more than 9 degrees compared to those living in nonurban areas -- only behind New York and Chicago.\n\nThe heat island effect is caused by the amount of buildings, roads, and other infrastructure that absorb and reemit the sun's heat more than forests and rivers. Dark surfaces, such as black asphalt roofs, reflect less light and retain more heat. As a result, certain areas can become hotter during extreme heat relative to suburban and rural areas, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nWinkle said we could see a cooling later in the summer that brings averages down, or a cooler summer next year.

Additionally, more than 9,000 high school athletes are treated for heat-related illnesses every year, according to Scientific American.\n\nAs the heat moves in, what are the risks to children, how can they be avoided, and how can heat-related illnesses be identified?\n\nWhy are children at risk from heat?\n\nOne of the primary reasons that children are more at risk than adults of heat-related illnesses is because they have a smaller cardiovascular output and a higher metabolic rate than adults, according to the federal government's HEAT.gov resource.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, children's bodies can warm 3-5 times faster than adults and sweat less.\n\nThe fact that children playing sports outside often ignore the signs of heat-sickness, according to Climate Central, puts children especially at risk.\n\nAccording to Climate Central, high levels of heat in children can even impact their ability and concentration to learn. This is because their cognitive functions tend to slow down in hotter temperatures.\n\nWhat are the signs of heat-related illness?\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heat stroke kicks in when the body cannot control its temperature and its sweating mechanism fails. This can result in body temperature rising as high as 106 degrees within 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nHeat stroke can result in death or permanent disability if not immediately treated.\n\n\"People should be mindful to always have a place to cool off. Make sure if you go out or travel, have something to drink,\" National Weather Service meteorologist Les Colin told the Idaho Statesman.\n\nThe Weather Service tweeted tips on avoiding heat exhaustion and stroke and the next step to alleviate the issue.\n\nWhat to do: Move to a cooler area, loosen clothing and sip on cool water. Seek medical help if the symptoms don't improve because heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke.\n\nWhat to do: Move the person to a cooler area, loosen clothing, remove any extra layers, and cool with water or ice.", "source": {"uri": "idahostatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho Statesman"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shaun_goodwin@idahostatesman.com", "name": "Shaun Goodwin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_illness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat illness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boise, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boise, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientific American"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basal metabolic rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Environmental Protection Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exhaustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat exhaustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermoregulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.idahostatesman.com/latest-news/ob1iup/picture277503013/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/0720_14_Heat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Stretching from California to Washington, a heat dome has settled in, pushing temperatures to record-breaking highs in the midst of summer. Here is where we are at across the West:\n\nLos Angeles Times reported, \"In a Monday forecast, the National Weather Service described the situation as a 'seemingly never-ending heatwave,' with warnings remaining in place for much of the state's interior through Saturday. In some cases, the heat has already been deadly, and officials are urging people to take the extreme heat seriously.\"\n\nRecord-breaking temperatures sizzled across parts of California. Notable mentions include Death Valley, which reached a scorching 128 degrees Fahrenheit on July 6, almost beating the record of 130 degrees set in July 1913; Barstow-Daggett, where temperatures soared to a record-breaking 118 on July 9; and Palm Springs, which hit its peak on July 8 at 122, the highest since 1958.\n\n\"'This is the most extreme heat wave in the history of record-keeping in Las Vegas since 1937,' said meteorologist John Adair, a veteran of three decades at the National Weather Service office in southern Nevada,\" PBS reported.\n\nOn Tuesday, Las Vegas toyed with an all-time record of 120 degrees, but settled for a daily record of 119, according to PBS News.\n\nPBS News interviewed Alyse Sobosan, a 15-year resident of Las Vegas, Nevada. Sobosan stays indoors and waits until 9 p.m. to go for a walk, emphasizing that it's dangerously hot to be outside otherwise.\n\n\"It's oppressively hot,\" Sobosan said. \"It's like you can't really live your life.\"\n\nHeat advisories have made their way to Phoenix, Arizona, as temperatures have soared to 118. According to Newsweek, the historic heatwave is now affecting 1 in 5 Americans, and experts are predicting that this year will be the hottest year recorded in human history.\n\nNewsweek also reported a Phoenix resident was shocked to see his neighbor's blinds had melted.\n\n\"Walking his dog over the weekend, he was stopped in his tracks. 'I walk my dog every day and noticed the blinds on Friday or Saturday the 5th and 6th. That apartment was recently remodeled with these new blinds,' Shawn told Newsweek. 'I was surprised and concerned about them maybe catching fire. I had seen other apartment blinds warping, but nothing like this. Mostly people that live west-facing and get the hottest part of the day have issues,'\" per Newsweek.\n\nResidents of Arizona have been told to avoid alcohol as extreme temperatures blanket the city.\n\nBoise, Idaho, is on track to break its highest temperature record of 111 degrees, set on July 12, 1898. The Idaho Statesman reported, \"Boise's forecast high for Wednesday -- just two days shy of the 126-year anniversary of that Boise heat -- is 108, but there's a good chance the City of Trees could get even hotter.\"\n\nEven if Boise doesn't reach its record temperature, the state is expected to break the streak of consecutive days at or above 103.\n\nElsewhere, Wyoming is preparing for temperatures in the high 90s through the end of the week, areas of Oregon are setting records with five straight days over 100 degrees, and Colorado officials are warning of an extended heat wave headed to that state this weekend.\n\nThe National Weather Service warns that southern Utah is under excessive heat warnings this week, while northern Utah will likely hit 100 degrees in the days ahead.\n\n\"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that approximately 1,220 people are killed by extreme heat in the U.S. annually. However, it appears that number is climbing, as the Department of Health and Human Services reported that 2,302 people died of heat-related causes last year. Vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and those with chronic medical conditions are particularly at risk,\" per Newsweek.\n\nThe National Weather Service said heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, causing hundreds of casualties each year.\n\nSuggestions to protect yourself from heat-related illness include staying hydrated, eating smaller meals, wearing lightweight clothing, take cool baths or showers and staying out of the sun as much as possible.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

When there's sudden changes, the temperature doesn't cool at night, all these things increase the risk of heat illnesses or other underlying conditions like heart attack or stroke.\"\n\n\"The good news is heat illnesses are preventable,\" she continued. \"Some of the warning signs include heavy sweating, muscle cramps, weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, paleness, tiredness, irritability and dizziness. If people are getting confused, passing out or vomiting, seek medical attention right away.\"\n\n\"Our three tips are: stay hydrated, stay cool, and stay informed,\" said Nguyen, \"Drink before you're actually thirsty ... to cool off your body as you sweat. Stay away from sugary, alcoholic or caffeinated drinks, which can dehydrate you. Stay cool and adjust your activities to air conditioned places when there's a health alert ... If you can't find one, find your nearest cooling center, mall or library. Also, use cold showers, lightweight clothing and sunblock.\"\n\n\"In this time of climate change, we're getting more alerts and there may be alert fatigue. But when people stop paying attention, that's when it gets dangerous,\" she added.\n\nHeat is the deadliest weather condition, \"far more than wildfires and other disasters like floods,\" added Amy Palmer, deputy director of crisis communications and public affairs at the state Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES). \"We will remain activated through the end of this weekend, monitoring events and responding to needs around the state.\"\n\nCalifornians can sign up for local emergency alerts at listoscalifornia.org/alerts.\n\nAs for employees, California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) regulations include heat illness prevention, said Charlene Gloriani, Cal/OSHA senior safety engineer.\n\nOutdoor employees have a right to be trained on heat illness; to be watched for acclimatization during high heat for the first two weeks of a new job; to access clean drinking water at no cost; to access safe shade with temperatures beyond 80 degrees; to be monitored for signs of heat illness beyond 95 degrees; and to receive cooldown rest periods every two hours beyond 95 degrees.\n\nOn June 20, 2024, Cal/OSHA also approved regulations for heat illness prevention in indoor workplaces, said Gioriani. \"The Office of Administrative Law has 30 working days to review the proposal, and the regulation will take effect immediately after the approval ... It's very similar to the outdoor standard. Generally, it applies when indoor temperatures are above 82 degrees ... and if it's above 87 degrees, require employers to implement engineering controls.\"\n\nTo file a workplace hazard complaint or get safety information from Cal/OSHA staff in English or Spanish, Californians can call 833-579-0927 between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m.\n\nStaying safe in water\n\nAndrew Ramos, captain of the Sacramento Fire Department, said \"I operate a 14-person CalOES swift water rescue team here in Sacramento ... We conduct about 30 water-related rescues a year, which is a lot, and unfortunately, a majority of those involve deaths in drowning.\"\n\nDue largely to melting snowcaps, \"our waterways are colder, deeper and faster than normal right now,\" he explained. \"Although they may appear safe to wander into, use extreme caution. Make sure you're wearing a Coast Guard-approved life vest and can swim. I was just speaking with another fire captain today, and he said in over 30 years, he's never had to save a person wearing a life vest.\"\n\nLife vest loaner programs are available in counties statewide through the California State Parks Division of Boating and Waterways.\n\n\"If you do fall in the water, don't panic, breathe slowly and stay calm,\" Ramos continued. \"Kick off your shoes, try to keep your head above water, look out for debris and make your way to the sides of the stream ... if someone near you falls in, please don't dive in after them. Throw a flotation device towards them, have them grab it and call 911.\"\n\nListos California\n\n\"These extreme weather conditions are a complex environment for Californians to adapt to,\" said Sonya Harris, senior advisor for Listos California. In response, after the Camp Fire in 2019, Governor Newsom's office created Listos, an education campaign and resource hub to help Californians prepare for disasters.\n\nHarris said that Listos has been increasing outreach around wildfire smoke in the form of multilingual social media videos emphasizing tips including understanding and checking the local Air Quality Index (AQI); closing doors and staying inside when the AQI is high; signing up for local utility plan shut off alerts; and keeping batteries and phones powered in the event of an outage.\n\nSince 2023, Listos California has called over three million Californians through a phone bank program, asking them to sign up for local emergency alerts, with one in four having signed up -- \"An incredible, incredible return, if we're thinking about tangible, life-saving benefits,\" she said.\n\n\"Really, all incidents are local,\" Harris added. \"What we've learned in our work is that Californians are ready to prepare and help their families stay safer.\" (Ethnic Media Services)", "source": {"uri": "usa.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "INQUIRER.net USA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hope you're able to stay cool with the excessive heat taking over the Beehive State this afternoon.\n\nA very large area of high pressure will inch closer to Utah and is responsible for ushering in dangerously hot temperatures throughout the state.\n\nDangerous heat builds in the Beehive State this week, heat warnings in effect\n\nToday, our high temperatures in northern Utah will climb above average and make a run for the upper 90s with the chance of Salt Lake hitting 100, which is just the beginning of a prolonged period of triple-digit heat for Northern Utah.\n\nSouthern Utah continues with extreme heat today, with an excessive heat warning in effect, and highs climbing above 110 degrees for the third day in a row. This ridge of high pressure brings clear skies -- and plentiful sunshine means direct sunlight, so you want to limit your time outdoors during the heat of the day.\n\nThe National Weather Service has posted several heat alerts across the state. Lower Washington County, Zion, Lake Powell, and Glen Canyon Recreation area have been under an Excessive Heat Warning since Sunday morning and will remain under one until midnight Friday night.\n\nTemperatures in the impacted area will range from 105 to 115 degrees throughout the week. We also have Excessive Heat Warnings posted for valleys on the western side of the state from 9 a.m. Wednesday through midnight Saturday including the Wasatch Front, the West Desert, and the Salt Lake, Utah, and Cache Valleys.\n\nTemperatures from 102 to 107 degrees are possible for impacted areas. When heat alerts like this are posted, it means we also get very mild overnight lows in the mid to upper 70s and little recovery time which adds to heat stress on our bodies.\n\nThis is a heat wave that could easily result in an uptick in heat-related illnesses, so please use caution outdoors. Remember to stay cool and hydrated, wear light clothes, and double-check for kids/pets in the car and those prone to heat illness.\n\nIn addition to the high heat and dry weather today, we also see an increase in northerly winds which adds to an increase in fire danger. Red Flag Warnings go into effect at noon for parts of Central Utah and the Color Country Mountains.\n\nThe warning holds through 9 p.m. and winds of 10 to 15 miles per hour are expected with gusts of 20 to 30 miles per hour. Relative humidity will be as low as six percent, which means that wildfires will spread at a rapid pace if they start.\n\nThese critical fire conditions will occur near large wildfires already burning and could make it a tough day for fire crews and cause erratic fire behavior.\n\nOther than the fire danger, the extreme heat is the biggest takeaway for Utahns for the work week. We will be treading in record territory in both Northern and Southern Utah with our best chances for record heat in Southern Utah on Thursday and Friday and along the Wasatch Front Friday and Saturday.\n\nFor reference, the all-time high for Salt Lake City is 107 degrees, which we have hit four times since record-keeping began, and we may see temperatures climb that high toward the end of the week as the heat continues to build over the state.\n\nThe all-time high in St. George is 117 degrees, which isn't expected to be reached over the course of the week -- however, there's a chance we'll be within a degree or two on Thursday or Friday. We also have the potential to break the record in St. George today with a high of 113 degrees expected!\n\nWe'll keep you up-to-date on the latest developments in our 4Warn Weather forecast both on-air and online. We are Good4Utah!\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Andrew Porter, executive director, said more people are stopping by in search of water, which the Pasco shelter provides during hot weather.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday, no heat-related deaths had been reported by the Benton and Franklin county coroners.\n\nIn Kennewick, the heat wave prompted organizers of the Drums Along the Columbia to delay the start of a performance at Neil F. Lampson Stadium on Monday. Performances by the drum and bugle corps from Colorado, Idaho, Wyoming, Seattle and the Tri-Cities-based Columbians started after 8 pm.\n\nThe Historic Downtown Kennewick Partnership rescheduled its annual Downtown Impact Awards after concluding that it will be too hot Wednesday to safely honor citizens for their contributions to the community.\n\nThe Impact Awards program is now set to begin at 5:30 p.m., Sept. 18, at 10 E. Bruneau Ave., Building C. Stephanie Button, executive director, indicated organizers are reconsidering the event schedule in the future with temperatures and possible wildfire smoke events in mind.\n\nThe current heat wave serves as a handy reminder that Washington law requires employers to provide outdoor workers with access to both water and cool-down facilities.\n\nIn 2023, the Washington Department of Labor and Industries conducted more than 412 heat-related inspections and issued 108 citations.\n\nTo date in 2024, it has conducted 140 inspections and issued 39 violations.\n\nThe workers compensation system accepted 53 heat-related claims in 2022, with farm workers and laborers being the top occupation for claims. Construction was second most common industry to experience heat-related illness.\n\nWorkers comp accepted 84 heat claims in 2021, a record driven by the infamous \"heat dome\" that settled over the region.\n\nThe current heat rules, which were updated in 2023, requires employers to be proactive in keeping workers safe.\n\nL&I advises employers to be proactive and ensure that as temperatures rise, they provide sufficient water and rest breaks to prevent heat-related illness or even death.\n\nProtections start when the temperature reaches 80 degrees F, and ramp up with the thermostat.\n\nWhen temperatures are at or above 90, employers are required to provide a 10-minute cool down rest period every two hours. At 100 degrees F or above, outdoor workers must be offered a 15-minute cool down period every hour.\n\nEmployers must a shaded area, air conditioned building or vehicle to provide respite.\n\nThe must also provide one quart per hour of cool water per employee.\n\nWorkers showing signs of heat exhaustion should move into shade, drink water and take other steps to avoid serious or even fatal conditions.\n\nHeat exhaustion symptoms include heavy sweating, a fast, weak pulse, cold, pale and clammy skin, headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting and weakness and/or ramps.\n\nHeat stroke should be treated as a medical emergency requiring professional treatment. Symptoms include hot, red and dry skin with no sweat, a body temperature of 104 or higher and a fast, strong pulse, nausea and/or loss of consciousness.\n\nRead more about the high heat rules

And according to Millersville University's Weather Information Center, the current heat wave is more extreme and dangerous.\n\nThe highest temperature during the heat wave in 2022 was 94 degrees, while the lowest daily high temperature during the current heat wave was 93 on July 4, according to the weather information center.\n\nOvernight lows during the 2022 heatwave were roughly in the upper 60s to low 70s, while lows this week have mostly been in the mid- to upper 70s.\n\nThe county has been under a heat advisory since Monday; it remains in effect until 8 p.m. today. Heat advisories are issued when the heat index -- how hot the air feels when humidity is factored in --exceeds 100 degrees.\n\nThe heat wave likely will last through Thursday, with a forecast high of 91, according to the National Weather Service, but the heat should break a bit Friday, with a high of 84.\n\nParts of the county also have been experiencing drought conditions since July 2, with the central part of the county in a moderate drought and the rest experiencing abnormally dry conditions, a stage just short of a drought.\n\nWhen it comes to rain, the county's first chance of measurable precipitation this month comes this afternoon into tonight with the passing of Hurricane Beryl's remnants, according to the weather information center.\n\nThe storm is predicted to move into the eastern Great Lakes region today and reach northern New England by Thursday, bringing a weak cold front with showers and thunderstorms across northern Maryland and the Lower Susquehanna Valley.\n\nWith temperatures continuing to climb, how does heat impact crops?

People can expect temperatures to gradually dip, with only a 2 to 3 degree difference from Tuesday to Wednesday.\n\n\"But we'll really start to feel the difference as we get into Thursday and beyond,\" Reedy said.\n\nSeattle's high temperature Wednesday is forecast to reach 88 degrees, a small drop from the temperatures in the 90s on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe high for Thursday is expected to be in the mid-80s, and Reedy said temperatures will hover in the 83-to-86-degree range into the weekend.\n\nThe most noticeable difference in temperature, he said, will be overnight. Tuesday night's overnight low is forecast to be around 63 degrees. Then the low will dip to around the mid- to upper 50s Wednesday night.\n\nBut the hot days won't be behind Seattle for long, as a second heat wave is possible again later this summer, according to Reedy.\n\n\"We're right here in early to mid-July, so we may see another one, because remember, August tends to be even a little warmer still,\" Reedy said. \"So, we may see one or two more down the road, but this isn't going to be something that's going to be too routine for us here in Western Washington.\"\n\nThe Seattle area has seen multiple instances of record-breaking heat this week, including Seattle-Tacoma International Airport hitting 98 degrees Tuesday, breaking the previous record of 95 degrees. A record was also broken in Olympia, with temperatures hitting 100 on Tuesday, passing the previous record of 95 degrees.\n\nSeattle also saw record-high numbers, with the temperature hitting 97, breaking the previous record of 91 degrees.\n\nThe increased heat also brings a higher risk of wildfires, with the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center saying Monday that there is \"near record\" wildfire danger due to the high temperatures. Washington issued its first air quality alert of 2024 on Tuesday due to ongoing wildfire smoke, reducing air quality for Chelan County and part of the Methow Valley down to Brewster in Okanogan County.\n\nAdditionally, multiple services and organizations have sent out warnings and reminders as the heat remained steady throughout Tuesday. Puget Sound-area authorities are warning people to be vigilant of children falling through windows as summer heats up and Puget Sound Energy has repeatedly asked customers to reduce energy use to minimize strain on the area's electrical grid.\n\nMercer Island is continuing its urgent request for residents and businesses to conserve water amid the ongoing heat wave.\n\nThere has also been focus on the safety of infrastructure in the city, including Seattle Department of Transportation crews spraying steel bridges with cool water Tuesday to prevent parts of the bridges getting stuck due to heat expansion.\n\nReedy added that as the heat subsides, it is important to still continue to use heat safety precautions since temperatures will continue to be above average, and heat exhaustion and heatstroke are possible.\n\nSigns of heat exhaustion include feeling faint or dizzy, excessive sweating, cool and clammy skin, nausea, a rapid weak pulse and muscle cramps. Heatstroke symptoms include a body temperature above 103 degrees, throbbing headache, confusion, lack of sweating, hot dry skin, nausea or vomiting, a rapid strong pulse and a loss of consciousness, according to Washington state's Emergency Management Division.\n\n\"Remain hydrated, take breaks if you're working outside, stay in the shade and never leave your pets or children not attended in the vehicle for any amount of time,\" Reedy said.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A potter's field burial site on Hart Island was receiving 24 bodies each day, as many as the city typically used to bury there in a week.\n\nLast month in Karachi, Pakistan, temperatures approached 120 degrees Fahrenheit and hospitals reportedly treated thousands for heatstroke. A nonprofit operating four mortuaries registered 128 deaths in a single day, mostly of people on the margins of society. The next day it registered 135. There are no reliable citywide death totals, but over a five-day period the Edhi Foundation, which handles about 40 daily deaths in more normal times, says it took in 568 bodies.\n\nLast weekend, the heat came home for Americans. In June, more than one-third of the country's population was under extreme heat advisories, but immediately after Independence Day things intensified. In Palm Springs, Calif., temperatures reached a record 124 degrees, Las Vegas broke its own previous record by three degrees and in Death Valley, Calif., temperatures reached 129, within one degree of the all-time, anywhere-in-the-world modern record. Across the West, temperatures routinely registered 15 to 30 degrees above average, and in California, at the beginning of a \"historic\" heat wave made five times more likely by climate change, scientists predicted a statewide death toll of about 100 each day.\n\nIn his vivid book \"The Heat Will Kill You First,\" Jeff Goodell describes one worst-case scenario as \"the Hurricane Katrina of extreme heat,\" echoing the words of the researcher Mikhail Chester: a dayslong blackout in metropolitan Phoenix coinciding with a now-routine heat wave and half of the city requiring medical attention. This is, admittedly, an unlikely set of circumstances -- the whole city going fully dark for a few days, then taking a few more to get power up and running again. But suspected heat deaths in Phoenix have nearly doubled since last year, when temperatures reached 110 or more for 31 straight days and the city's burn centers were filling up with people who had fainted or fallen and been scalded by asphalt. Fourteen people died from those contact burns; this year, so far, four have.\n\nIt has been a remarkable year globally, with 12 straight months now registering global average temperatures more than 1.5 degrees above the preindustrial average. More than 60 percent of the global population -- almost five billion people -- faced extreme heat between June 16 and June 24, according to analysis by Climate Central, including about 600 million each in both China and India.\n\nIn Delhi, India, June highs averaged 107 degrees and May highs averaged over 106. By the middle of June, the city recorded its hottest night in over five decades, and the Safdarjung hospital there reported nearly 10 times as many deaths as had been observed earlier in the month, when temperatures were already extremely high, as Anumeha Yadav reported for the The Migration Story in a harrowing dispatch from the hospital's \"heat ward.\" One of the patients, a young migrant in his 20s who worked the pizza oven for a delivery service, arrived with a temperature over 105 degrees and a heart rate of 170 beats per minute. He was registered with only a first name. \"A tall security guard, in a black and red uniform, stepped out of the hospital's new emergency block and called out,\" Yadav wrote. \"Who is with Rohit? Who is with Rohit?\" There was no response.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Manitoba Health, Seniors and Long-Term Care is reminding Manitobans to make heat health part of their summer planning by knowing the health-related risks of heat, taking precautions to prevent overheating and learning how to recognize and respond to symptoms of heat illness.\n\nHeat illness can cause a variety of symptoms including:\n\nAnyone experiencing these symptoms should move to a cool or shaded place, lie down, drink water and use cold compresses. If someone loses consciousness, has confusion or red, hot and dry skin, call 911.\n\nEveryone is at risk for heat illness, especially during prolonged periods of high heat and humidity. However, the risks are greater for older adults, infants and young children, people who spend a lot of time outdoors, people with chronic conditions and people living alone, especially if they are living in an urban area or do not have air conditioning. People unaccustomed to high temperatures are also at higher risk.\n\nManitobans are encouraged to check in regularly with vulnerable or isolated friends and family who might be at risk.\n\nAll Manitobans can take care to prevent heat illness by:\n\nIf planning on being outside all day at an outdoor event, such as the Winnipeg Folk Festival, take time stay safe:\n\nHeat waves may coincide with wildfires and poor air quality. If planning to stay indoor during those conditions, it may be safer to keep windows open to stay cool.

A look at some common misconceptions about Arizona's heat and climate.\n\nAgainst the beginnings of a vermillion sunset made more stunning by heat-enhanced air pollution scattering less-vibrant wavelengths, researchers from the Southwest Integrated Field Laboratory set up for an evening of public education at Phoenix's Desert Botanical Garden.\n\nPeter Price, a Ph.D student in Arizona State University's Herberger Institute design school, bends his tall frame to pull the little red wagon housing \"MaRTy2,\" one of the team's two smaller mobile weather monitoring units, across gravel at sunset plaza, the garden's designated stage for each day's costume change to night.\n\nElevated to approximately head-height in the wagon, MaRTy2's instruments can measure and record location-specific air temperature, humidity and wind speed, as well as solar radiation (visible sunlight and UV rays) and longwave radiation (heat emitted from surfaces). The last two values are less typical for weather equipment and are what make the two \"MaRTy\" carts special, Price says. They can be combined to produce an estimate of the mean radiant temperature (MRT) that would be experienced from above and below by a pedestrian in that spot.\n\nWhen not wheeled out for public display or data collection, MaRTy1 and MaRTy2 live in the SHaDE Lab at ASU, an urban climate research group directed by Ariane Middel that stands for Sensable Heatscapes and Digital Environments. Situated within the School of Arts, Media and Engineering and the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, the initiative represents an interdisciplinary convergence of different research approaches onto one of the state's most pressing of problems, what Middel calls \"the 'hot' topic of urban heat.\"\n\nHeat safety tips: On Heat Action Day, a report shows the growing influence of climate change on temperatures\n\nHeat in Phoenix is both sensable, as in possible to sense (some might call it impossible not to sense), and sensible as an area of study. Last year, record-breaking temperatures contributed to the heat-related deaths of 645 people across Maricopa County, a 52% increase over the 425 who succumbed to heat the previous year. This escalating death toll is despite an increase in efforts by many groups to provide water, cooled shelter and other services throughout the summer.\n\nOn a call with reporters last month, Michelle Litwin, Phoenix's Heat Response Program manager, said her team handed out 400,000 water bottles and provided 28,000 people with heat response supplies last year in hopes of flipping that trajectory of human loss. The city is also planting more tree shade, testing reflective pavement coatings and operates a \"Cool Caller\" program to check on vulnerable residents during heat waves.\n\nBut it's clear more work is needed to address the soaring impact of intensifying heat.\n\nCentering on the heat problem\n\nIn Phoenix's urban environments, data from the National Weather Service show that average July temperatures in the 1920s, when this collection of records began, were between 89.3 and 92.7 degrees. Over the past decade, that average has not dipped below 94.7 and hit a new high of 102.7 degrees in 2023. Scientists who have compared temperature changes in dense urban areas to those in nearby parks, forests and farmlands say the increase is about half due to human-caused climate change and half due to the heat-trapping result of development sprawling out in every direction.\n\nAn analysis published Wednesday by the nonpartisan research organization Climate Central zoomed in on this urban heat island (UHI) effect in 65 major U.S. cities to explore the inequity of warming across urban areas. Their map of calculated UHI values across census block groups in Phoenix shows a pattern of greater temperature increases in lower-income and minority neighborhoods as a result of zoning and development that incorporated less cooling vegetation or heat-aware urban planning. Consequences are often higher heat-related death tolls and costs of staying alive.\n\nQuantifying the urban heat island: How much of the heat can we blame on the heat island?\n\nOn average, the report determined Phoenix residents experience temperatures that are 7.4 degrees hotter due to urban development, on top of the atmospheric warming caused primarily by burning fossil fuels. In Tucson, the urban environment has resulted in temperatures that are 7.7 degrees higher on average.\n\nThese are actually some of the lowest average increases reported out of 65 cities analyzed, which Climate Central's senior data analyst Jennifer Brady said can be explained by the more diffuse impact of Arizona's sprawling development style compared to more compact cities with denser downtown areas. Regardless, since Arizonans already exist at the edge of survivable summer temperatures, any extra warming can become an existential threat.\n\n\"This is 'additional heat,'\" Brady said. \"An additional 7 or 8 degrees (in Phoenix) is going to, on average, be added to a much higher baseline temperature than in some place like New York, which had neighborhoods with higher UHIs.\"\n\nWhile science is always bolstered by similar results confirming known patterns, none of this is news to scientists and leaders based in Phoenix where, as a matter of necessity, some of the most groundbreaking heat studies and mitigation efforts are already taking place.\n\nPhoenix is paving the way on urban heat research and mitigation\n\nRepresented at the Desert Botanical Garden's sunset plaza by just a fraction of its members, the scientists of the Southwest Integrated Field Laboratory, or SW-IFL, hail from all three Arizona state universities plus the Brookhaven National Laboratory, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and IBM Research. In recognition of the modern severity of urban temperatures, they've teamed up to study the ways heat in cities can be sensed by instrumentation, experienced by humans and modeled using simulations.\n\nThe end goal is to deliver \"next-generation\" predictive tools and resilient solutions that are both specific to the Southwest and translatable across the sunbelt.\n\nRead our heat + housing series: As Arizona builds to solve a housing crisis, will its homes withstand future heat extremes?\n\nSW-IFL's mission is one example among many of how Phoenix researchers are paving the way -- in this case by studying pavement -- for other cities sure to be confronted with unprecedented heat extremes as climate change and urban development continue to progress.\n\nOther Phoenix-based heat laboratories include a branch of the national Center for Heat Resilient Communities, which was recently awarded $2.25 million in federal funds from President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and is led locally by ASU professor Sara Meerow, also a scientist with SW-IFL. Another is the Southwest Sustainability Innovation Engine, a collection of research institutions, cities and business partners led by ASU that was launched in January with $15 million from Biden's CHIPS and Science Act to \"deploy new solutions to extreme regional dryness and heat.\" Beyond those initiatives, ASU's Global Futures Laboratory hosts more researchers focused on urban heat than you can shake a rain stick at.\n\nAcross the state, quick scans of the University of Arizona's Extreme Heat Network, professor Ladd Keith's work with UA's Climate Assessment for the Southwest, or climate modeling by Northern Arizona University's Ecological and Environmental Informatics group and United Nations climate report author Kevin Gurney show the local depth of knowledge on rising temperatures. Arizona-based scientists with the Grand Canyon Monitoring and Research Center, the Southwest Biological Science Center and the National Ecological Observatory Network, to name just a few, add to the state's expertise.\n\nPhoenix's municipal leaders are also increasingly seen as experts on heat and how to deal with it.\n\nThe stampede of national and international news outlets that have looked to former ASU heat researcher David Hondula for comment on how cities can manage the risks of unexpected heat waves since he took the helm at Phoenix's Office of Heat Response and Mitigation indicates the authority Arizonans have established on understanding urban heat.\n\nPhoenix Mayor Kate Gallego was also tapped innumerable times during last summer's record-breaking heat to weigh in on how cities less familiar with high temperatures can attempt to prepare. Despite being frustrated at many of the resulting news stories labeling Phoenix an \"inferno,\" a \"hell on earth\" or \"a blighted dystopian hellscape,\" she remains positive that America's hottest big city can still become the world's most sustainable desert city, a central part of her platform as a politician and former environmental studies major.\n\nThe Mayor responds to heat in the news: Mayor Kate Gallego on Phoenix's 'hellscape' year and what's in store for 2024\n\nGallego has taken steps toward this desert sustainability goal by creating the nation's first publicly-funded heat office, now run by Hondula, passing a Climate Action Plan to track and reduce the city's greenhouse gas emissions, pushing for more electric vehicle infrastructure, launching a pilot program for cool pavement coatings and securing federal funding for more tree shade, among other initiatives.\n\nBut she has also taken heat for allowing unsustainable growth (her office is currently considering streamlining building permit approvals), including welcoming an influx of data and microchip technology centers into the region that require huge amounts of energy and manufacture more heat and emissions.\n\nCooling pavement initiative needs to heat back up\n\nAt the same time that Phoenix-based heat initiatives establish expertise, solutions missteps also serve as lessons.\n\nOne of those might be Gallego's faltering cool pavement program. In a video about the 2021 pilot study for the program, ASU heat researchers Jennifer Vanos and Ariane Middel shared mostly positive results about the potential for light-colored pavement coatings to reduce temperatures on city streets and in neighborhoods. There are some reflectivity issues that could expose pedestrians to higher temperatures in some cases (as measured by head-height MaRTy carts). But overall, they concluded the option seems promising, with average afternoon surface temperatures on treated streets 10 to 12 degrees lower than traditional dark asphalt.\n\nThis could be life-saving for lower-income or unhoused Phoenix residents who spend more time waiting for buses or walking to destinations, said David Sailor, who leads the SW-IFL team as another member of ASU's urban heat research professoriate and works with the city to study cool pavement applications.\n\n\"We have a lot of pedestrian deaths in Phoenix and Tucson, it's really bad,\" he said. \"The cooler pavement surface might also improve visibility at night.\"\n\nGiven these results, Sailor is not sure why the city hasn't applied more of the cooling sealant. The Phoenix Street Transportation Department's cool pavement website shows that about half of the districts slated for treatment in 2023 were rescheduled for 2024.\n\nIn response to The Republic's inquiries about this, Sasha Perez, a spokesperson for the street department, said in late June that since 2020 the city has completed \"120.4 total miles of cool pavement installation to date.\" That's the same number listed on tallies posted to the program website as of August 2023. She said the application schedule for 2024 is set to resume later this year after the department completes \"its testing of materials to evaluate product specifics and ensure performance standards are met.\"\n\nFeeling concerned about the climate?: Take our survey to get in the loop on future climate anxiety and action events\n\nSailor had a more grim take, noting that streets have to be resealed every few years anyway and the cost difference is minimal between the traditional dark sealant and the promising cooling sealant. (The reporter's own residential street in Phoenix received a fresh coat of dark sealant earlier this year.)\n\n\"Street departments that have been doing things a certain way for 30 years are not incentivized to do something different,\" Sailor said.\n\nGallego did not respond to questions about why the program has fallen behind schedule, but did send a statement reaffirming the benefits of cool pavement and Phoenix's status as a leader on urban cooling strategies.\n\n\"Along with increasing shade and encouraging smarter design for our desert climate, cool pavement is an important tool to reduce the impacts of the urban heat island effect,\" Gallego told The Republic in late June. \"Phoenix has the largest cool pavement program in the country, and we continue to analyze its performance over time in partnership with Arizona State University.\"\n\nSense and sensability\n\nWhile city employees become the first to navigate the logistics of many heat mitigation options, researchers in Phoenix press on to collect the data necessary to drive these efforts.\n\nParked on the other side of the sunset theater from where Price pulls the MaRTy cart, another heat-sensing vehicle appears to be a scaled-up version of the same. For the moment, the Brookhaven National Laboratory's Center for Multiscale Applied Sensing is headquartered in a Ford F550 truck with a bed full of specialized monitoring equipment designed to capture even more detail about the atmospheric signatures of heat waves.\n\nThe center's environmental and climate scientists, including director Katia Lamer, often travel with it from New York, chasing heat waves. After stopping at the public engagement event at the Desert Botanical Garden, she and her crew planned to drive the truck through neighborhoods in Phoenix, Tucson and beyond while its instruments record a deluge of data about how complex urban environments influence sensed heat.\n\nLamer says the truck's mobility adds granularity to the scientific understanding of fine-scale temperature differences across space. The team also returns to certain areas to monitor changes over time as the human forces of development and climatic warming extend their reach.\n\n\"We use a combination of remote sensors that emit light and wait for it to be scattered by aerosols or clouds to measure wind patterns, the thickness of clouds overhead, rain when it falls to the ground,\" Lamer says, listing a few of the truck's capabilities. \"We also use weather balloons to take profiles of air temperature and humidity. The idea is that each piece of instrument on board measures a different component of the weather and climate system. And when we put it all together, we can understand how things work.\"\n\nA saguaro arm's reach away, Alamin Molla, a Ph.D student working with Sailor at ASU, explains to visitors how heat research also involves measuring longwave radiation and radiative flux from helicopters and satellites. He points to different areas on a large printed map that shows a patchwork pattern of sensed heat throughout the Valley.\n\nSome spots on the map are bright red, including downtown Phoenix and South Mountain, where a boy died from heat exposure on July 3. Even though the area the boy was hiking with his family is undeveloped, that south-facing rocky landscape absorbs and retains a lot of heat from the sun, Molla explains.\n\nOther mapped locations appear a relative lush green, including swaths of Scottsdale and Tempe where urban planning and tree planting have been prioritized. Members of the public are encouraged to add a push pin to the map in the area where they live and to engage in discussion about its hue.\n\nRead our climate series: The latest from Joan Meiners at azcentral, a column on climate change\n\nZooming out, these collective efforts to understand and address heat in Phoenix at different scales and with different tools may very well be unrivaled.\n\nBut that seldom seems to factor in to how much heat the city takes as criticism for its extreme summers from people who choose to live elsewhere. Many Valley residents love the heat. Others make seasonal plans to escape it. While old timers debate how much it has increased over time -- proclaiming \"it has always been hot here\" -- legions of scientists who have measured this advocate for strategies to control its rise.\n\nEither way, Arizonans are sensing the heat.\n\nJoan Meiners is the climate news and storytelling reporter at The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

For instance, between Friday (July 5) and Saturday (July 6), mercury soared never-seen-before 48.33 degree Celsius and 47.22 degree Celsius in Redding, a city in Northern California, and Ukiah, north of San Francisco, respectively. Palm Springs, in Southern California, touched a record-breaking high of 51.11 degree Celsius.\n\nThe scorching temperatures and dry conditions are a result of a heat dome centred over California.\n\nHere is a look at what a heat dome is, how it is tied to the behaviour of the jet stream, and how climate change impacts heat domes.\n\nWhat is a heat dome?\n\nA heat dome is a weather phenomenon where a high-pressure system in the atmosphere traps warm air like a lid on a pot, for an extended period of time. As the warm air is not able to rise upward, the sky remains clear -- clouds are formed under the opposite circumstances as the rising warm air cools down, and the water in it condenses out.\n\nThe high-pressure system allows more sunlight to reach the earth, which results in more warming and drying of soil. This leads to less evaporation and reduces the likelihood of the formation of rain clouds. The longer the heat dome stays in one place, the warmer conditions can get with every passing day. While heat domes cause heatwaves, they can occur without heat domes as well.\n\nWhat is the role of the jet stream?\n\nA heat dome's formation is tied to the behaviour of the jet stream -- an area of fast-moving air high in the atmosphere that usually helps move weather systems along the Earth's surface.\n\nHow is climate change impacting heat domes?\n\nScientists are still debating over how climate change is impacting the blocking weather events that cause heat domes. However, they have ascertained that rising global temperatures have made heat domes larger and more intense.\n\nA 2021 study carried out by an international team of 27 climate researchers, who were part of the World Weather Attribution, found that searing temperatures recorded during the heat dome in Canada, which occurred in June that year, \"would have been virtually impossible without the influence of human-caused climate change\".\n\nAnother study, published in the journal Nature 2023, indicated that the intensity of heat domes is outpacing the rate of global warming -- which means that climate change is fuelling their intensity.\n\n\"The intensities of hot extremes associated with... heat dome-like atmospheric circulations increase faster than background global warming in both historical change and future projection\", the study said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Rising temperatures have led to an increase in heat-related illnesses.\n\nHeat-related deaths are predicted to increase 370% by the year 2050 according to The Lancet's countdown on health and climate change.\n\nBaton Rouge EMS has already responded to 20 heat-related service calls this month. Brad Harris with EMS says they expect to receive at least 60 by the end of the month.\n\n\"Typically if there's a hurricane, we do see more heat-related injuries because of people being out of power, they don't have access to air conditioning or they're outside working on their yard picking up debris and that sort of thing so they become overheated,\" Harris said.\n\nWhen dealing with these illnesses, Harris says EMS relies on IV fluids, air conditioning, and ice packs to get the patient back to normal body temperatures.\n\nAs first responders around the nation work to keep people safe in the record-breaking heat, a Los Angeles-based company says it's developed a new device to combat heat-related deaths. ColdVest is a one-time use vest its developers say can lower body temperatures in less than an hour.\n\n\"An emergency response to heat stroke that lowers your core body temp from five to ten degrees in thirty minutes, stays cold for up to an hour, doesn't require any power, any ice, any electricity,\" founder of ColdVest Tracie Wagman said.\n\nThe vest only needs two liters of a non-carbonated cold liquid to work.\n\nCurrently, the technology is being used for sports teams, the military, and construction workers.\n\nHarris says he would be willing to try this out here in the state and for EMS' life-saving efforts.\n\n\"The normal body temp is 98.6 degrees so anytime you get over 105 degrees, that's when you could definitely have some deficits from that, so if you can lower someone's body temperature by five degrees, ten degrees, that can mean all the difference in the world. That could mean the difference between someone having lifelong debilitating effects from this vs walking out of the hospital,\" Harris said.\n\nThe only downside, says Harris, is the roughly $450 price tag.\n\n\"We consider this an emergency response to heat strokes. The equivalent to a defibrillator for heat strokes and defibrillators are very expensive and need to be re-upped, and so it's a little bit like 'what is the cost of a life?'

In young people, all three work together to cool you off, drawing heat away from the core, sweating it out, and replacing lost fluids through rehydration, or drinking water. When those systems become less efficient, which happens naturally as one ages, it becomes harder and harder to cool off. In heat waves, those challenges become especially apparent.\n\nDr. Richard Dupee, Chief of Geriatrics at Tufts Medical Center, noted that chronic conditions that affect these systems become more common as we age. Conditions that affect the circulatory system, like high blood pressure, make it even harder to draw heat away from the body. And the more chronic conditions a person has, the more likely they are to be on prescription drugs such as sedatives, blood pressure medications, or diuretics that make it harder for the body to keep itself cool.\n\n\"It's much easier for an older person to get overwhelmed by heat and unable to control their own body temperature as a result,\" he said. \"The risk gets greater as you get older.\"\n\nMiller noted that not everyone who is elderly will be adversely affected by heat. Those who are physically active and don't have chronic illness, he said, might handle the heat \"just fine.\"\n\nConversely, there are some aging people who are affected much more than others. Those with dementia might struggle to recognize signs that they are overheating. Those living on a low income might have air conditioning but be reluctant to use it because of the cost of electricity. Those who live in urban areas often are surrounded by fewer trees and greater population density, both of which cause outdoor heat to rise more quickly.\n\nAnother reason to check on older adults during heat waves: loneliness. Both Miller and Dr. Marc Cohen, co-director of the LeadingAge LTSS Center at UMass Boston, note that staying home during heat waves can exacerbate these already-present feelings of social isolation. \"During a prolonged heat wave, it's good to check in and stay connected with elderly friends and neighbors,\" Cohen said. \"There's already a pandemic of loneliness in this country.\"\n\nAll three experts recommend similar precautions for seniors and others who are vulnerable to high temperatures. The number one most important tip is to hydrate, both with water and with drinks that can replenish lost electrolytes, like Gatorade.\n\n\"Don't wait until you're thirsty to drink,\" Miller said, noting that older people might already be dehydrated by the time their body signals that it needs water. Other tips include seeking out air conditioning -- whether at home, at a mall, in a library, or in a nearby cooling center -- calling 911 if you think you're overheating, and avoiding outdoor exercise.\n\nSunscreen is a must, and so is loose-fitting clothing.\n\nMiller also suggested checking with your doctor to find out if your medication puts you at greater risk of heat-related illness.\n\nHe also noted that, as the population ages, people continue to live longer, and climate change continues to usher in record-shattering temperatures, the number of older adults affected by heat waves will only increase.\n\n\"Morbidity and mortality associated with more frequent and longer heat waves disproportionately impacts older adults,\" he said. \"It's with very good reason that this is an area that we need to focus on, so we can keep people healthy and safe during periods like this.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Boston", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heat wave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circulatory_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Circulatory system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tufts_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tufts Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fluid replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweat_gland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sweat gland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geriatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geriatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerontology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypertension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspiration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perspiration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loneliness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loneliness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diuretic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diuretic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sedative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoregulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermoregulation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Birth_Control", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Birth Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical_Therapy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Physical Therapy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/Yz6sp8jMcvMYEHpLNlkB7DRPS_o=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/4YBA2FI2WXNIVSPADBXW2N62JU.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

The National Weather Service offers essential advice to help residents manage the heat:\n\nSlow Down: Reduce or reschedule strenuous activities to the coolest parts of the day. Those at risk should seek the coolest available place, not necessarily indoors.\n\nDress for Summer: Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing to reflect heat and sunlight, aiding in maintaining normal body temperatures.\n\nWatch Your Diet: Foods high in protein can increase metabolic heat production and water loss. Opt for lighter meals to help keep your body cool.\n\nHydrate: Drink plenty of water or non-alcoholic fluids, even if you don't feel thirsty. Your body needs extra water to stay cool.\n\nAvoid Alcohol: Alcoholic beverages can dehydrate you, so it's best to avoid them in hot weather.\n\nSeek Air Conditioning: Spending time in air-conditioned places can significantly reduce heat-related risks. If you can't afford air conditioning at home, spend some time each day in air-conditioned environments.\n\nLimit Sun Exposure: Too much sun can hinder your body's ability to dissipate heat. Protect your skin to stay cool and safe.\n\nIn addition to these tips, it's important to recognize the signs of heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Symptoms can include heavy sweating, weakness, dizziness, nausea and headaches. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, move to a cooler place, drink water and seek medical attention if necessary.\n\nCommunity centers, libraries and shopping malls can serve as great places to cool off if your home lacks air conditioning. Many local facilities open their doors to residents needing relief from the heat, providing a safe and cool environment during the hottest parts of the day.\n\nParents should ensure that children also are following these safety guidelines.

It was only half a degree cooler than the warmest June on record in 2010. The website's weather records, thanks to previous observers as well, go back to 1898.\n\nIf it's this hot and humid now, what's it going to be like for the Tri-State area at the peak of summer?\n\nWe posed that question to Anthony Artusa, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Climate Predication Center.\n\nTips: Here's how to stay cool and safe during Hagerstown heat wave\n\nMinor league baseball: Hagerstown Flying Boxcars end week with victory as Atlantic League's second half begins\n\n\"We have a 50% to 60% chance for above normal temperatures\" through September, Artusa said.\n\nArtusa said climate prediction meteorologists can't say what that will mean in terms of, \"Will it be the hottest summer on record?\" or \"Will there be more heat waves?\"\n\nBut what it does mean is there's a good chance folks in the Mid-Atlantic will experience more hotter days than typical this summer.\n\nSo far this year, the average monthly temperatures, including the average highs and lows, have all been higher than normal average temperatures, according to Keefer's website.\n\nIt's not just the high temperatures. There have been several days when the heat index, how hot it really feels, has gone well over 100. The heat index peaked at or near 110 degrees on June 22 and June 30, according to Keefer's site.\n\nArtusa said the early heat waves seem to be related to \"high pressure aloft.\" Those are ridges or areas of fair weather typically about 20,000 feet in the atmosphere, so high that air compresses and sinks. That heats the air.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center's anticipation of more warmer days than usual this summer is tied to a number of indicators, including sea surface temperatures, he said. The various data is plugged into climate models to create a seasonal forecast.\n\nOne of those factors is drought.\n\nEastern and southern Washington County, as well as much of southern Franklin and Fulton counties in Pennsylvania, and southern portions of West Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, are in a moderate drought, according to Drought.gov. While other parts of the Tri-State area, including western Washington County; Morgan County, W.Va., and most of Berkeley County, W.Va., are in a severe drought.\n\nIf there was high soil moisture, the sun would take time to evaporate that moisture.\n\n\"And evaporation is a cooling process,\" Artusa said.\n\nBut with the ground so dry, there isn't that evaporation and the air can heat up more, he said.\n\nIt all adds up to the likelihood that more often that not, it will be pretty hot on any given day this summer.\n\n\"We know that the last 30 years, on average, has been somewhat warmer than average,\" Artusa said. \"For this year, I guess this is pretty much what we would expect.\"\n\nWith such high temperatures during the day, it also has been rather warm at night.\n\nThe nightly low reached 70 degrees or higher eight times in June and at least six times already in July, according to Keefer's website. It's been in the low to mid-80s around midnight on at least four nights in the past week.\n\nThe Climate Prediction Center's forecast of more warmer days than usual this summer holds true for nights as well, Artusa said.\n\nMelanoma: What to watch for under the July sun\n\nWhen the nights are hot too is when it can get dangerous for folks who don't have air conditioning, according to an experimental HeatRisk tool from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWhen it barely gets below 80 degrees at night, Artusa said it can be hard for people to escape the heat without air conditioning. When you can't recuperate at night, cooling off, is when the risk of heat-related deaths can go up. The body doesn't have a chance to recuperate from the stress and duration of the heat if it's constantly in hot conditions, he said.\n\n\"You have to get a break,\" Artusa said.", "source": {"uri":

It's going to be hot and humid regardless, just maybe not as bad as what we've seen (this past week).\"\n\nBaldwin said any thunderstorm formation would occur along the coast and push inland from the sea breeze.\n\n\"There will be spotty showers and wind here and there, but it won't be a total washout,\" Baldwin said.", "source": {"uri": "eu.pnj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pensacola News Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blue Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pensacola_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pensacola Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pensacola Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin_County,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baldwin County, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baldwin County, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_breeze", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea breeze"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Heating_and_Cooling", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Heating and Cooling", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Climate_Control", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Climate Control", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy_and_Environment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Energy and Environment", "wgt": 16}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2023/07/08/PPEN/037222f8-debd-47c1-aa93-95079ce44d1d-Hi-REZ_2023_Beach_Air_Show-Saturday_6.JPG?auto=webp&crop=2999,1687,x0,y152&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716354", "eventUri": "eng-9716354", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 0, "relevance": 1}

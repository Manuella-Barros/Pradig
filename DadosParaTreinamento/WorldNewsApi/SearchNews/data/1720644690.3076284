Here's what you need to know to start your weekend: How to queer your weekends during Pride month in L.A.California\u2019s heat wave breaks records and fuels wildfires.The best drag brunches in L.A. to visit during Pride Month and all year long.And here's today's e-newspaper Happy Pride Month! The worldwide celebration of the LGBTQ+ community kicked off last weekend. West Hollywood ushered in the month with a parade featuring go-go dancers in jockstraps and gay cowboys in breezy leather chaps. L.A. Pride festivities begin today with Pride in the Park, a musical experience with singer Ricky Martin as the headliner. As the month goes on, there will be more events and celebrations to shine a light on Pride Month throughout Southern California. But they don\u2019t have to be a parade or concert. If you\u2019re looking for a different way to honor the LGBTQ+ community, Times contributor Claire O\u2019Callahan compiled a list of 10 joyous L.A. spots to queer your weekend. Whether you\u2019re in town for Pride, a recent transplant or simply looking for a new way to celebrate, this guide has something for you. O\u2019Callahan\u2019s experience stems from being a newcomer to L.A. two years ago, and in search of community. She soon found it at queer-owned restaurants, bars and shops across L.A. County. These spots not only give you an opportunity to support local, queer-owned businesses, but they also offer a space to connect and build community \u2014 whether it\u2019s over food or a glass of wine. Start your queer weekend with a visit to Everybody in Cypress Park. The trans- and woman-owned gym offers multiple types of exercises like yoga and boxing. The facility prioritizes an inclusive, accessible environment for people of all body types and gender expressions, which starts with reading a social contract on how to show up in the gym during your first visit. Your first visit is free and memberships are discounted during Pride month. Head to Los Feliz for a stop at Black Forest Bakery. On Saturday mornings, a 1971 Ford Econoline uses baked goods to transport customers to the mountains of southwest Germany. When you approach the window to order, trans and queer baker Djo Maurer will greet you through the van\u2019s pop-out window selling sourdough loaves, pretzel buns and jam-filled Berliners (German jam donuts). You\u2019ll also have the option to do a good deed through Maurer\u2019s pay-it-forward program where customers can pay for a loaf and leave it behind for someone with fewer resources to pick up for free. You can also queer your weekend with some wine at The Ruby Fruit in Silver Lake. O\u2019Callahan recommends heading there around 3 p.m. when it begins its transition from campy diner to sexy wine bar. The sit-down lunch menu is replaced with a list of snack-while-you\u2019re-drinking options such as warm marinated olives and french fries. All the wines and beers are from women- and queer-owned businesses. Fan favorite cocktails include the Martha, an elderflower, citrus and white wine spritz and the Miller Low Life (a Miller High Life served in a glass upside down). Cap off your queer weekend with a lively night on the dance floor in East Hollywood at Honey\u2019s at Star Love. \u201cA nightlife haven for queer, lesbian and trans folk,\u201d O\u2019Callahan wrote. \u201cThe colorful bar is known for throwing a spirited dance party on its checkerboard dance floor into the early hours of the morning.\u201d Never a stranger to a themed night, the bar has hosted evenings like an emo karaoke and dance party, and a lesbian dating party called Uhaul.

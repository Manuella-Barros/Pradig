He explained that while a public or civil servant should go home at the end of every month with a wage that would be enough for him till the end of the month, the demand for a living wage should not be outrageous considering the state of the economy and condition of some state governments which may not be able to pay it. \u201cI\u2019m an advocate of a substantial living wage for workers. But what the labour unions are currently demanding is outrageous. Would state governments be able to pay half a million naira as minimum wage to a level one civil servant? Remember, some state governments have not even paid the N30,000 minimum which is the current situation. What would happen when another jumbo pay is added to them?\u201d he queried. The lawmaker who was briefing journalists in Umuahia on Saturday suggested that all the parties in the negotiation table should tell themselves the home trust by agreeing on a payable salary which would not harm the economy nor make the Nigerian worker undergo affliction while serving as a public servant. While suggesting that a new minimum wage should be pegged at N100,000 per month, Okwara-Osonwa, asked state governments to assume a role as major stakeholders rather than being a bystanders in the current negotiation, adding that a best approach that will be for the benefit of all parties should be adopted and accepted. On the epileptic power supply in Nigeria, the Representative called for the invitation of foreign energy handlers to take over the energy needs of the country. According to him, there is nothing on ground to suggest that only Nigerians are capable of handling the nation\u2019s energy needs. \u201cI\u2019m worried with the level of epileptic power supply in our country today. For instant, in my home town, Ohafia, we\u2019ve not had electricity for over five years. How can we survive under that kind of situation; how can a people produce anything under that situation, without electricity so long a time? \u201cIf we look beyond the shores of Nigeria and hire firms that are experts in providing electricity, our energy problem would have been solved. Virtually everything we do today depends on electricity. If Nigeria be a produce nation, we must ensure a steady electricity supply. Remember that the more you produce, the cheaper it becomes. But we can\u2019t produce when the energy is not there,\u201d he contended. On the cost of running government, federal lawmaker said inasmuch as he is not advocating for the return to the Parliamentary system of government, he would rather plead that the cost of governance at all levels should be reduced drastically to curb unnecessary wastages. \u201cYes, I agree that the cost of running the Presidential system is high as compared with the Parliamentary system. In Parliamentary system, those you elected are your Ministers and Advisers. But in Presidential system the Ministers that are not elected hold sway; some of them have eight to 10 vehicles in their convoys. T \u201cWe should find a way of reducing the cost of governance so that some wastages and unnecessary spending are sieved off. The Presidential system is costly I agree\u201c, he said.

He told us that we would have to lose weight or else we face increasing health problems as we got older. We were both rather shocked at how forthright our doctor was \u2014 even though he spoke to each of us separately. As a result of this we looked into all the options, including Ozempic and other injections (but didn\u2019t like the possible side effects), a tummy tuck (very expensive in Ireland \u2014 very dangerous abroad) and decided just to go on a new regime of eating: almost no potatoes, rice, bread or pasta and also cutting down on the booze \u2014 particularly the spirits and the pints of stout. I didn\u2019t miss the booze so much (just three nights a week with no booze!) and the food was actually delicious without the carbs.", "summary": "<p><b>Question:</b> My wife and I are in our late forties with a good relationship and three healthy children in their teens who are pretty well adjusted.

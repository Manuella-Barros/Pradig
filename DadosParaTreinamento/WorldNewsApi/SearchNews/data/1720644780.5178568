{"id": 231286548, "title": "Sun went off the road on gas tax and fees | READER COMMENTARY", "text": "It never ceases to amaze me when a selective use of statistics is offered in an attempt to strengthen a narrative. In justifying the significant increase in Maryland\u2019s vehicle registration fees, the Baltimore Sun Editorial Board cites Florida as having a higher registration fee (\u201cDrivers may moan but higher registration fees are overdue,\u201d June 5). But that\u2019s where the comparison ended. The editorial failed to mention that the Republican governed state has no state income tax, relatively low property taxes and a state sales tax the same as Maryland. Furthermore, in discussing gasoline taxes and costs, the board seems to make a big deal about an upcoming drop in gas tax of less than one cent per gallon. With the size of a typical fill-up, it will hardly be noticeable. I might add the Florida gas tax is currently 10 cents lower per gallon. Now, with respect to gas prices, the editorial conveniently omitted the average gas price at the end of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration when it was in the low $2-a-gallon price region. Now, one final fact to ponder is where the asphalt will come from for road construction and repairs. The lion\u2019s share of asphalt comes from the end product of that \u201cdreaded\u201d fossil fuel refining. So with the proposed forced obsolescence of petroleum usage, expect road construction and repair costs to go up if asphalt supplies dwindle and more expensive alternatives like concrete construction are employed. \u2014 Michael Ernest, Catonsville Add your voice: Respond to this piece or other Sun content by submitting your own letter.", "summary": "Recent editorial used facts selectively to claim Maryland vehicle registration fee increase is reasonable.", "url": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/2024/06/08/sun-off-road-on-fees/", "image": "https://www.baltimoresun.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/04/14/5Q2FC374YNBYDNI5O4DIQV5BKE.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:09:01", "author": "Reader Commentary", "authors": ["Reader Commentary"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.451}

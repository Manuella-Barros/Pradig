Photographs: AIFF/X\n\nThe talismanic Sunil Chhetri stirred up emotions in his final international outing but the Indian football team just could not rise to the occasion as it settled for a goalless draw against Kuwait in its crucial World Cup qualifying match in Kolkata on Thursday, critically hurting its chances of going into the next round.\n\nIn a country deprived of major footballing success, it was not the best farewell for a man who had created an alternative universe for the spectators of the beautiful game in this part of the world.\n\nA win would have virtually sealed India (five points) a World Cup qualifiers third round berth for the first time ever but the draw put them in an extremely difficult situation to do so as they play Asian champions Qatar in their last match on June 11.\n\nIf India fail to beat Qatar, then Kuwait -- currently on four points -- can make it to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers if they beat Afghanistan on June 11.\n\nThe 39-year-old Chhetri ended his glorious 19-year international career as the fourth most prolific scorer in international football with 94 goals, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).\n\nIt's an astounding feat for a player from a country like India and FIFA had acknowledged Chhetri's legendary status when he announced his international retirement on May 16.\n\nChhetri bid an emotional adieu to the international game in front of a jam-packed 68000-capacity Salt Lake Stadium with his parents Kharga and Sushila, wife Sonam Bhattacharya and a host of officials and former players in attendance.\n\nHe will, however, continue playing club football for two more years. He has a contract with the Indian Super League side Bengaluru FC till next year.\n\nChhetri had scored in his debut match against Pakistan on June 12, 2005 in Quetta in a 1-1 draw but not on Thursday, though the game ended in a draw this time also. He also did not have much to show for in the whole match.\n\nAfter his 151st match for the country, Chhetri gave a last bow, taking a lap of honour of the packed venue with folded hands as chants of \"Sunil, Sunil\" echoed the stands.\n\nKuwait looked a much improved side from the last time when they suffered a 0-1 defeat to India at home.\n\nThe first-half saw a flurry of activities, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.\n\nBut the action on the field kept the fans on the edge of their seats as they kept screaming \"Sunil, Sunil\", \"Vande Mataram\".\n\nKuwait's best chance of the first-half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi threaded a perfect through ball to Daham, who surged past Nikhil Poojary. Mohammad Daham's effort was denied by a crucial save from the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.\n\nIn the 11th minute, India responded as Liston Colaco surged from the left wing, sending in a low cross as all eyes focused on Chhetri's 95th goal. But Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance thwarted the Indian captain's attempt.\n\nFrom the ensuing corner, Anwar Ali's header just missed the target, much to the crowd's anticipation.\n\nAl-Rashidi latched onto a chipped pass from Al-Harbi, but his attempted chip over Gurpreet sailed over the bar.\n\nIn the 25th minute, the debutant Jay Gupta was in thick of action. Gupta delivered a sublime low cross from the left, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner.\n\nIndia failed to utilise a freekick in the 28th minute when Poojary showcased his skills with a superb run down the right wing, nutmegging a defender before being brought down. Thapa's delivery, however, didn't yield a goal.\n\nJust at the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait could only clear to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. His left-footed shot was blocked, and the rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.\n\nKuwait, frustrated by Gupta's defensive efforts, switched play from the right to the left, only for the move to end with the ball going out of play.\n\nIgor Stimac made a bold move by shuffling their attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali up front with Brandon Fernandes and Chheri behind him.\n\nBut it failed to yield the desired result as he failed to convert his chances.\n\nIn the 47th minute, Faisal Al-Harbi tested Gurpreet with a low volley, but India's custodian stood firm.A minute later, Rahim found himself one-on-one with the Kuwait keeper Sulaiman Abdulghafor, but couldn't convert.\n\nDespite India's openness at the back, Gurpreet's brilliance denied Kuwait's Rashidi just moments later.\n\nAs India asserted dominance, Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute with a denied penalty claim, incensing players and bench alike.\n\nReplays suggested a foul, but the Chinese referee Fu Ming deemed otherwise.\n\nTempers flared up to a mini-brawl after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, leading to a confrontation between him and Sultan Alenezi, both receiving yellow cards.\n\nAmid the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' atrocious delivery meant India's last hope for a win went up in smoke in the added seven minutes.\n\nStimac handed left-back Gupta international debut in his 4-2-3-1 formation with Chhetri the sole striker up front. It was only months back Gupta made his league debut for FC Goa in the top tier Indian Super League.", "source": {"uri": "rediff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rediff.com India Ltd."}, "authors":

The talismanic Sunil Chhetri stirred up emotions in his final international outing but the Indian football team just could not rise to the occasion as it settled for a goal-less draw against Kuwait in its crucial World Cup qualifying match here on Thursday, critically hurting its chances of going into the next round.\n\nKolkata, Jun 6 (PTI) The talismanic Sunil Chhetri stirred up emotions in his final international outing but the Indian football team just could not rise to the occasion as it settled for a goal-less draw against Kuwait in its crucial World Cup qualifying match here on Thursday, critically hurting its chances of going into the next round.\n\nIn a country deprived of major footballing success, it was not the best farewell for a man who had created an alternative universe for the spectators of the beautiful game in this part of the world.\n\nAlso Read | Namibia vs Scotland, ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 Free Live Streaming Online: How to Watch NAM vs SCO Cricket Match Live Telecast on TV?.\n\nA win would have virtually sealed India (five points) a World Cup qualifiers third round berth for the first time ever but the draw put them in an extremely difficult situation to do so as they play Asian champions Qatar in their last match on June 11.\n\nIf India fail to beat Qatar, then Kuwait -- currently on four points -- can make it to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers if they beat Afghanistan on June 11.\n\nAlso Read | PAK 66-3 in 10 Overs | Pakistan vs USA Live Score Updates of ICC T20 World Cup 2024: Shadab Khan and Babar Azam Fight Back.\n\nThe 39-year-old Chhetri ended his glorious 19-year international career as the fourth most prolific scorer in international football with 94 goals, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).\n\nIt's an astounding feat for a player from a country like India and FIFA had acknowledged Chhetri's legendary status when he announced his international retirement on May 16.\n\nChhetri bid an emotional adieu to the international game in front of a jam-packed 68000-capacity Salt Lake Stadium with his parents Kharga and Sushila, wife Sonam Bhattacharya and a host of officials and former players in attendance.\n\nHe will, however, continue playing club football for \"two more years\". He has a contract with the Indian Super League side Bengaluru FC till next year.\n\nChhetri had scored in his debut match against Pakistan on June 12, 2005 in Quetta in a 1-1 draw but not on Thursday, though the game ended in a draw this time also. He also did not have much to show for in the whole match.\n\nAfter his 151st match for the country, Chhetri gave a last bow, taking a lap of honour of the packed venue with folded hands as chants of \"Sunil, Sunil\" echoed the stands.\n\nKuwait looked a much improved side from the last time when they suffered a 0-1 defeat to India at home.\n\nThe first-half saw a flurry of activities, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.\n\nBut the action on the field kept the fans on the edge of their seats as they kept screaming \"Sunil, Sunil\", \"Vande Mataram\".\n\nKuwait's best chance of the first-half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi threaded a perfect through ball to Daham, who surged past Nikhil Poojary. Mohammad Daham's effort was denied by a crucial save from the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.\n\nIn the 11th minute, India responded as Liston Colaco surged from the left wing, sending in a low cross as all eyes focused on Chhetri's 95th goal. But Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance thwarted the Indian captain's attempt.\n\nFrom the ensuing corner, Anwar Ali's header just missed the target, much to the crowd's anticipation.\n\nAl-Rashidi latched onto a chipped pass from Al-Harbi, but his attempted chip over Gurpreet sailed over the bar.\n\nIn the 25th minute, the debutant Jay Gupta was in thick of action. Gupta delivered a sublime low cross from the left, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner.\n\nIndia failed to utilise a freekick in the 28th minute when Poojary showcased his skills with a superb run down the right wing, nutmegging a defender before being brought down.\n\nThapa's delivery, however, didn't yield a goal.\n\nJust at the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait could only clear to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. His left-footed shot was blocked, and the rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.\n\nKuwait, frustrated by Gupta's defensive efforts, switched play from the right to the left, only for the move to end with the ball going out of play.\n\nIgor Stimac made a bold move by shuffling their attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali up front with Brandon Fernandes and Chheri behind him.\n\nBut it failed to yield the desired result as he failed to convert his chances.\n\nIn the 47th minute, Faisal Al-Harbi tested Gurpreet with a low volley, but India's custodian stood firm.\n\nA minute later, Rahim found himself one-on-one with the Kuwait keeper Sulaiman Abdulghafor, but couldn't convert.\n\nDespite India's openness at the back, Gurpreet's brilliance denied Kuwait's Rashidi just moments later.\n\nAs India asserted dominance, Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute with a denied penalty claim, incensing players and bench alike.\n\nReplays suggested a foul, but the Chinese referee Fu Ming deemed otherwise.\n\nTempers flared up to a mini-brawl after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, leading to a confrontation between him and Sultan Alenezi, both receiving yellow cards.\n\nAmid the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' atrocious delivery meant India's last hope for a win went up in smoke in the added seven minutes.\n\nStimac handed left-back Gupta international debut in his 4-2-3-1 formation with Chhetri the sole striker up front.\n\nIt was only months back Gupta made his league debut for FC Goa in the top tier Indian Super League.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Kuwait were better at it in the early stages as they slipped in passes between the channel of right back Nikhil Poojary and centre back Rahul Bheke.\n\nMohammad Abdulah went in behind Poojary and it needed Gurpreet Singh to come off line and prevent India from conceding as early as the fourth minute.\n\nAbdulah enjoyed space but couldn't find a partner inside the box moments later though he forced Gurpreet to rush out several times, which probably compelled Eid Alrashidi to lob over with only the Indian keeper to beat.\n\nIndia had to push the ball towards their inverted wingers Liston Colaco on the left and Lallianzuala Chhangte for them to cut back into their preferred kicking foots. Though they had sighters but none were on target. Neither was Anwar Ali's header from a corner, in what was India's most presentable moment in front of goal.\n\nIndia coach Igor Stimac preferred Jay Gupta over Subhasish Bose as his first-choice left back possibly for his greater attacking verve and in the goalless first half he could only send one inviting cross that a backtracking Hasan Alanezi cleared with a desperate tackle, having done the same thing minutes earlier before a waiting Sunil Chhetri could pounce.\n\nKuwait closed down the inside runs of Chhangte and Colaco more confidently than what Poojary could do as their front trio of Abdulah, Faisal Alharbi and Eid Alrashidi tried to pass it among themselves in small triangles looking for that telling passes. It didn't materialise in the first 45 minutes but had the four-man Indian backline scampering into tackles.\n\nHad both teams been more penetrative they could have score but India being goalless from open play in their last six games and Kuwait only netting twice in their last four matches, goals were expected to be at a premium.\n\nStimac tried to shake things up after the break and be more direct by introducing Rahim Ali for Sahal Abdul Samad and Bradon Fernandes for Anirudh Thapa. It could have been a genius move had Ali slotted in after slipping in behind his marker to neatly control Brandon's visionary pass. But just like Abdulah, Ali rushed his shot and shot straight at Kuwait keeper Sulaiman Abdulghafoor.\n\nAfter wasting such a glorious chance, creating another such moment would have always been difficult for the home side and so it proved as Kuwait also couldn't find a breakthrough even though they looked more threatening and would have a legitimate claim of being denied a penalty when Anwar brought down Yousef Alsulaiman when he got away from him in the 74th minute.\n\nAs India have to face group toppers Qatar away on June 11 in their final group assignment and Kuwait face Afghanistan they had to push for a victory in front of the sizeable spectators who waited for the crowning moment with bated breath.\n\nSo came in Manvir Singh and Edmund Lalrindika, the first I-League player to play for the national team in five years, for Colaco and Gupta. But they couldn't provide the spark needed to turn the fate of action though anxious moments were created inside the Kuwaiti box.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sayan_mukherjee@news9live.com", "name": "Sayan Mukherjee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Chhetri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Chhetri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivekananda_Yuba_Bharati_Krirangan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_\u0160timac", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Igor \u0160timac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Asian_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Asian Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ali_(footballer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anwar Ali (footballer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liston_Colaco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liston Colaco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subhasish_Bose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subhasish Bose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Bheke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Bheke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lallianzuala_Chhangte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lallianzuala Chhangte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manvir_Singh_(footballer,_born_1995)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manvir Singh (footballer, born 1995)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahal_Abdul_Samad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahal Abdul Samad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahim_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahim Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Lalrindika", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Lalrindika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I-League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anirudh_Thapa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anirudh Thapa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Asia", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SC-11-Kuwait.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630931", "eventUri": "eng-9630931", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 658, "textEnd": 665, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

But India failed to recreate its previous performance to see its World Cup qualification dreams virtually evaporating in front of a massive turnout of 58,921.\n\nIndia's Jay Gupta and Kuwait's captain Yousef Alsulaiman in action during the Qualifier Match at the Yuva Bharati Krirangan at Kolkata on Thursday. | Photo Credit: R.V. MOORTHY\n\nIndia, which remains on five points from as many matches, now has a Herculean task on its hands. It travels next to Doha to play its last match on June 11 against a mighty Qatar, which currently tops the group, having won all its four matches.\n\nIt was a bigger disappointment for Indian captain Sunil Chhetri, who left the ground in tears, apparently unable to secure the desired win in his last outing for the country.\n\nThe match remained largely uneventful, with India struggling to find its footing in attack. Indian head coach Igor Stimac employed a youthful attacking midfield employing the likes of Liston Colaco, Sahal Abdul Samad and Lallianzuala Chhangte to support Chhetri in attack. India made a few incursions inside the Kuwait box but failed to find the finishing that could decisively beat the opponent goalkeeper, Sulaiman Abdulghafoor.\n\nKuwait came up with a more cohesive performance and troubled India on numerous occasions. Kuwait had the first chance in the fourth minute when its winger Mohammed Abdulah latched onto a through-pass and found himself unmarked inside the Indian box. Goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh came out of the line to salvage the situation for India.\n\nIndia found its first chance in the 11th minute when Colaco darted into the Kuwait box before squaring the ball for an onrushing Chhetri. But the Kuwait defender Hasan Alenezi reacted first to clear the ball. India had a great chance to find the lead off the resultant corner, but defender Anwar Ali sent a free header over the crosspiece.\n\nStimac tried to overhaul the attack, introducing the likes of Rahim Ali, Manvir Singh and Brandon Fernandes after the break, but that hardly helped the Indian cause as the host's finishing failed to reach the desired standard.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivekananda_Yuba_Bharati_Krirangan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Chhetri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Chhetri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liston_Colaco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liston Colaco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kolkata"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Doha"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manvir_Singh_(footballer,_born_1995)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manvir Singh (footballer, born 1995)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahal_Abdul_Samad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahal Abdul Samad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahim_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahim Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lallianzuala_Chhangte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lallianzuala Chhangte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Asia", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/2px0xv/article68260311.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/6744_6_6_2024_22_1_19_1_08_RVM_7129.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630931", "eventUri": "eng-9630931", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-11", "textStart": 954, "textEnd": 961}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

In a country deprived of major footballing success, it was not the best farewell for a man who had created an alternative universe for the spectators of the beautiful game in this part of the world. A win would have virtually sealed India (five points) a World Cup qualifiers third round berth for the first time ever but the draw put them in an extremely difficult situation to do so as they play Asian champions Qatar in their last match on June 11.\n\nIf India fail to beat Qatar, then Kuwait -- currently on four points -- can make it to the third round of the World Cup qualifiers if they beat Afghanistan on June 11.\n\nThe 39-year-old Chhetri ended his glorious 19-year international career as the fourth most prolific scorer in international football with 94 goals, behind Portugal superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (128), Iran legend Ali Daei (108) and Argentine wizard Lionel Messi (106).\n\nIt's an astounding feat for a player from a country like India and FIFA had acknowledged Chhetri's legendary status when he announced his international retirement on May 16.\n\nChhetri bid an emotional adieu to the international game in front of a jam-packed 68000-capacity Salt Lake Stadium with his parents Kharga and Sushila, wife Sonam Bhattacharya and a host of officials and former players in attendance.\n\nHe will, however, continue playing club football for \"two more years\". He has a contract with the Indian Super League side Bengaluru FC till next year.\n\nChhetri had scored in his debut match against Pakistan on June 12, 2005 in Quetta in a 1-1 draw but not on Thursday, though the game ended in a draw this time also. He also did not have much to show for in the whole match.\n\nAfter his 151st match for the country, Chhetri gave a last bow, taking a lap of honour of the packed venue with folded hands as chants of \"Sunil, Sunil\" echoed the stands.\n\nKuwait looked a much improved side from the last time when they suffered a 0-1 defeat to India at home.\n\nThe first-half saw a flurry of activities, with both teams creating chances but failing to find the back of the net.\n\nBut the action on the field kept the fans on the edge of their seats as they kept screaming \"Sunil, Sunil\", \"Vande Mataram\".\n\nKuwait's best chance of the first-half came in the fourth minute when Eid Al-Rashidi threaded a perfect through ball to Daham, who surged past Nikhil Poojary. Mohammad Daham's effort was denied by a crucial save from the Indian goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.\n\nIn the 11th minute, India responded as Liston Colaco surged from the left wing, sending in a low cross as all eyes focused on Chhetri's 95th goal. But Hasan Alanezi's sliding clearance thwarted the Indian captain's attempt.\n\nFrom the ensuing corner, Anwar Ali's header just missed the target, much to the crowd's anticipation.\n\nAl-Rashidi latched onto a chipped pass from Al-Harbi, but his attempted chip over Gurpreet sailed over the bar.\n\nIn the 25th minute, the debutant Jay Gupta was in thick of action. Gupta delivered a sublime low cross from the left, but the Kuwait defense cleared it for a corner.\n\nIndia failed to utilise a freekick in the 28th minute when Poojary showcased his skills with a superb run down the right wing, nutmegging a defender before being brought down.\n\nThapa's delivery, however, didn't yield a goal.\n\nJust at the halfway mark, Thapa sent a fantastic ball into the box, which Kuwait could only clear to deny Sahal Abdul Samad. His left-footed shot was blocked, and the rebound fell to Liston Colaco, who fired a low strike into the side netting from a narrow angle.\n\nKuwait, frustrated by Gupta's defensive efforts, switched play from the right to the left, only for the move to end with the ball going out of play.\n\nIgor Stimac made a bold move by shuffling their attacking lineup, introducing Rahim Ali up front with Brandon Fernandes and Chheri behind him.\n\nBut it failed to yield the desired result as he failed to convert his chances.\n\nIn the 47th minute, Faisal Al-Harbi tested Gurpreet with a low volley, but India's custodian stood firm.\n\nA minute later, Rahim found himself one-on-one with the Kuwait keeper Sulaiman Abdulghafor, but couldn't convert.\n\nDespite India's openness at the back, Gurpreet's brilliance denied Kuwait's Rashidi just moments later.\n\nAs India asserted dominance, Kuwait's frustration peaked in the 74th minute with a denied penalty claim, incensing players and bench alike.\n\nReplays suggested a foul, but the Chinese referee Fu Ming deemed otherwise.\n\nTempers flared up to a mini-brawl after a challenge on Indian debutant Edmund, leading to a confrontation between him and Sultan Alenezi, both receiving yellow cards.\n\nAmid the tension, Edmund rallied the crowd's support with a free-kick opportunity, but Brandon Fernandes' atrocious delivery meant India's last hope for a win went up in smoke in the added seven minutes.\n\nStimac handed left-back Gupta international debut in his 4-2-3-1 formation with Chhetri the sole striker up front.\n\nIt was only months back Gupta made his league debut for FC Goa in the top tier Indian Super League.", "source": {"uri": "sports.ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTVSports.com"}, "authors": [],

Sunil Chhetri left a 58,921-strong Yuba Bharati Krirangan with bowed head, folded hands and tears running down his cheeks in his final lap of honour, reminiscent of so many storied India careers starting and ending with dejection. The dream of India qualifying for the third round of the FIFA World Cup is still alive, but barely. India know chances were spurned in a messy 0-0 draw at what was the best stage to deliver a dream and give a suitable farewell to a legend.\n\nIt will only get more difficult from here. Placed second in the group with five points, India now need a result against Qatar in their final league match, chances of which are bleak. \"We knew it would be tough,\" said India coach Igor Stimac after the game. \"All our games against Kuwait have been tight. But today we couldn't open the game the way we wanted. There wasn't enough aggression in the middle of the park. And not enough self-confidence at the start.\"\n\nHad it not been for Gurpreet Singh Sandhu's game awareness, India's chances of progression would have been snuffed on Thursday. But that was the only positive in an otherwise scrappy match. \"Gurpreet was brilliant but the others were not 100% in the way we wanted them to be,\" said Stimac.\n\nIt could all have been achieved here, at the heart of India's football. There weren't a lot of chances but some definitely trickled India's way. Anwar Ali failing to keep a free header on target in the 12th minute off an Anirudh Thapa corner-kick was the only definite chance to come India's way in a chaotic first half where Kuwait kept dispossessing the hosts in the midfield. India tried to switch to the wings, a move that yielded some promising moves.\n\nIn the 25th minute, Jay Gupta -- making his international debut -- floated in a cross from the left to Sahal Abdul Samad, but it was ultimately cleared. Four minutes later, Thapa sent in a cross that Kuwait's back line cleared but didn't fall beyond Samad on the edge of the box. Samad turned and quickly curled in a kick that ricocheted off one of the defenders and went to Liston Colaco, but his low kick crashed into the side netting.\n\nIt was only after the second half started that India's attack gained more steam with Suresh angjam dropping behind to become defensive midfielder after Igor Stimac supplanted Thapa with Rahim Ali and Sahal with Brandon Fernandes. It bore immediate results. First, Fernandes set up Ali with a piercing through that he linked up with, haring to the top of the box but his low shot was saved. Two minutes later, another chance for Ali and this time he was in the clear with a long through but the finish again was wide of the target.\n\nKuwait had their moments too. A penetrative pass from Eid Al Rashidi early into the first half opened up left-winger Mohammad Abdulah who skipped a sliding challenge from Rahul Bheke but ran into Sandhu under the horizontal. Four minutes later, again Abdulah again prised open the defence but his curled shot on goal was saved by Sandhu. Not until the middle of the first-half had Kuwait got another look at the goal, but Abdulah messed up that move.\n\nThat Kuwait were overly dependent on Abdulah was evident in the way most of their passes converged on him. He floated in a cross to the far post for Faisal Al-Harbi but his low volley was well parried by Sandhu before Yousef Al-Sulaiman speared the rebound over the post. It was a recurrent theme with Kuwait, with Abdulah shooting a free-kick from the centre well over the horizontal.\n\nKuwait's lapses allowed India to rebuild though, pressing through the fresher legs of Fernandes and Ali after the break. One corner from the left cleared, Fernandes sent in another in for Chhetri but it found Bheke, whose header went straight to Kuwait goalkeeper Sulaiman Abdulghafoor. But with the all-important breakthrough not coming, the game often seemed to lapse into phases of mediocrity.\n\nIf Liston Colaco wasted a promising forward pass, Abdulah struck the ball well over from horizontal. Manvir Singh was brought on to provide some momentum and it almost produced something when Fernandes set him up with a beautiful through but that move was killed by the industrious Hasan Alanezi.\n\nA final gamble in the form of Edmund Lalrindika substituting Gupta didn't produce the desired results as India kept stumbling in the final frontier, with Kuwait clearing a low cross from Fernandes before Manvir's header off a cross going wide of the goal. Things really came to a head when a brawl erupted on the sidelines after Lalrindka was yanked off the ball but it only provided a distraction from the real, and oft-repeated story of India falling short of their World Cup dream.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_\u0160timac", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Igor \u0160timac"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anirudh_Thapa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anirudh Thapa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivekananda_Yuba_Bharati_Krirangan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahal_Abdul_Samad", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sahal Abdul Samad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Fernandes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Fernandes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunil_Chhetri", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunil Chhetri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anwar_Ali_(footballer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anwar Ali (footballer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liston_Colaco", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liston Colaco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Bheke", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Bheke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahim_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rahim Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corner kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manvir_Singh_(footballer,_born_1995)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manvir Singh (footballer, born 1995)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Lalrindika", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Lalrindika"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing_Houses_and_Securities_Depositories", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Clearing Houses and Securities Depositories", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/06/06/1600x900/PTI06-06-2024-000256A-0_1717692078527_1717692112201.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630931", "eventUri": "eng-9630931", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Their legacy is checkered", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nMaternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nWhat is the history of American maternity homes?\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh holds her newborn daughter at the Florence Crittenton Maternity Home in Washington D.C. on August 10, 1966. Wilson-Buterbaugh gave birth during the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh/AP\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nA large painting of Jesus hangs in the Paul Stefan Foundation maternity home in Orange, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024.\n\nJessie Wardarski/AP\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nJasmine Heriot, right, a former Mary's Shelter resident, talks to the child of Meryem Bakache, a mother at Mary's Shelter maternity home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on Friday, January 5, 2024. Today there are more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., many of them faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates see them as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\nJessie Wardarski/AP\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nJasmine Heriot, a former Mary's Shelter resident, holds her infant's hand on Friday, January 5, 2024, in Fredericksburg, Virginia. In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion, there has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes. Today there are more than 450 homes in the U.S., many of them faith-based.\n\nJessie Wardarski/AP\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nDanielle Nicholson, a former maternity home resident of the Paul Stefan Foundation, sits for a portrait on Friday, January 5, 2024, in Orange, Virginia. Nicholson, who spent almost 5 years at the Paul Stefan home after giving birth, is now raising her soon-to-be sixth grade daughter.\n\nJessie Wardarski/AP\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stefan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Stefan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Scoop_Era", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baby Scoop Era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternity_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maternity home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adoption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

In the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion, there has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes. Today there are more than 450 homes in the [...]\n\nORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wade, a new beginning for maternity homes - WTOP News", "body": "ORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. They are there to receive housing and financial support.\n\nThere are homes, though, that continue to prioritize adoptions - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. The Lynchburg, Virginia, home was connected to an adoption agency.\n\nFrom a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house,\" she said. \"He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together.\"\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She hopes one day he might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThrough a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Their legacy is checkered", "body": "There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion\n\nMaternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nWhat is the history of American maternity homes?\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

Wade and the federal right to abortion\n\nORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wade, a new beginning for maternity homes", "body": "There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion\n\nORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. They are there to receive housing and financial support.\n\nThere are homes, though, that continue to prioritize adoptions - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. The Lynchburg, Virginia, home was connected to an adoption agency.\n\nFrom a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house,\" she said. \"He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together.\"\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She hopes one day he might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThrough a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, a large association of anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe living space before the birth of her second child. She lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up,\" Heriot said.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open maternity homes.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which includes more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, but she thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism.\n\n\"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb,\" she said.\n\nFinding a Village\n\nDanielle Nicholson lived at Paul Stefan for almost five years. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which includes more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, but she thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism.\n\n\"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb,\" she said.\n\nFinding a Village\n\nDanielle Nicholson lived at Paul Stefan for almost five years. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies. (Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh via AP)\n\nMaternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nWhat is the history of American maternity homes?\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wade, a New Beginning for Maternity Homes", "body": "ORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children.

Their legacy is checkered - WTOP News", "body": "Maternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the...\n\nMaternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Their legacy is checkered - KION546", "body": "Maternity homes have seen a resurgence in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nWhat is the history of American maternity homes?\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhat is the history of American maternity homes?\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

Wade, a new beginning for maternity homes", "body": "ORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. They are there to receive housing and financial support.\n\nThere are homes, though, that continue to prioritize adoptions - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. The Lynchburg, Virginia, home was connected to an adoption agency.\n\nFrom a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house,\" she said. \"He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together.\"\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She hopes one day he might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThrough a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, a large association of anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe living space before the birth of her second child. She lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up,\" Heriot said.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open maternity homes.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which includes more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, but she thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism.\n\n\"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb,\" she said.\n\nDanielle Nicholson lived at Paul Stefan for almost five years. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth.

Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nWhat is the history of American maternity homes?\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan: Rain Breaks 44-Year-Old Record, Inundates Lahore; 4 Killed, 6 Flighted Delayed (Watch Videos).\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. They are there to receive housing and financial support.\n\nThere are homes, though, that continue to prioritize adoptions - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. The Lynchburg, Virginia, home was connected to an adoption agency.\n\nFrom a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house,\" she said. \"He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together.\"\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She hopes one day he might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThrough a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, a large association of anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe living space before the birth of her second child. She lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up,\" Heriot said.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open maternity homes.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which includes more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, but she thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism.\n\n\"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb,\" she said.\n\nFinding a Village\n\nDanielle Nicholson lived at Paul Stefan for almost five years. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wade. Across the country, homes are sprouting up or expanding. Christian anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nMaternity homes differ from emergency shelters: They typically provide longer-term housing and wraparound services for pregnant women, sometimes for months or even years after birth. Many of them are faith-based, with founders who are Catholic or evangelical.\n\nMaternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame. In the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nIn 1883, the first Florence Crittenton home opened in New York as a place to reform unmarried \"fallen women,\" who were encouraged to keep their children.\n\nThat goal changed by the middle of the 20th century, when maternity homes began placing most babies with adoptive families.\n\nThe so-called \"baby boom\" was happening not only among married couples. A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home, painted in large letters, is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had chosen not to abort the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. \"We knew that we were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies,\" Evelyn James said.\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a grand former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, a nonprofit anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. As abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\n\"This is what supports the women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" Harkins said. \"Whether that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond narrowing abortion access. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe v. Wade. In what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption. Many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to live in maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh. She was 17 in 1966 when her parents sent her to a Washington, D.C., home run by Florence Crittenton, a large chain of maternity homes started by Progressive-era Episcopal reformers.\n\nBack then, maternity homes were secretive places, meant to hide pregnancies. Residents often used aliases. Some wore fake wedding rings in public. When they returned to their hometowns after birth and without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler, herself an adoptee, said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history. It's often discussed among members and at conferences.\n\n\"It is very dear to our hearts,\" Harkins said. \"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again.\"\n\nThe number of domestic infant adoptions has fallen sharply since the 1970s. When denied an abortion, women in one study overwhelmingly chose parenthood (91%) over adoption (9%), according to a 2016 analysis from researchers at the University of California San Francisco.\n\nAs the stigma of single parenthood has waned, most residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. Where maternity home residents once were largely middle-class, now poverty is a driving factor: Mothers are there to receive housing and financial support during and after their pregnancies, sometimes for years after giving birth.\n\nThere are now maternity homes that specialize in keeping children out of the foster care system. Others have honed their expertise in addiction recovery. And while many will help with adoptions, some continue to prioritize them and have ties to adoption agencies -- which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 and pregnant in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, a project of the late Jerry Falwell, the evangelical founder of the Moral Majority and Liberty University. The Lynchburg, Virginia, maternity home was connected to an adjacent adoption agency.\n\nHomeschooled and raised in a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house. He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together,\" she said.\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She posts on social media under the handle \" voicelessbirthmother,\" hoping that one day her son might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThe center's staff encouraged her to keep the child and look for housing. Through a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany maternity homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, one of the largest associations of anti-abortion counseling centers in the country.\n\nIt's one indication that maternity homes are now intertwined with the anti-abortion movement -- and one reason critics say the coercive nature of maternity homes lives on in a different form.\n\n\"I'm in favor of housing and supportive housing for lots of people. I don't think it should be contingent on somebody's decision to give birth or not,\" said Andrea Swartzendruber, a reproductive health researcher at the University of Georgia who studies anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live. And she was waiting for the day she could make a home elsewhere with her husband and baby.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe place to live before the birth of her second child. A certified nursing assistant, she lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up. It was really a breath of fresh air,\" Heriot said, as her newborn slept in her arms and her toddler played beside her.\n\nIn the absence of a robust social safety net, maternity homes are filling a void with needed services for women and children. While residents may use public assistance, neither Mary's Shelter nor Paul Stefan accept state or federal funds for their general operations. Other homes do take public money: There are federal grants available and at least five states have directed taxpayer dollars to maternity homes.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up or expanding. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open new maternity homes with fewer state regulations.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which over 18 years has grown to include more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nThey welcome women with multiple children, and despite their faith-based roots, have no religious requirements for residency. Residents sign a covenant for \"healthy living,\" though Wilson says they try never to kick anyone out.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, with little care given to families after birth.\n\nWilson thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism: \"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb.\"\n\nFinding a Village\n\nAt Paul Stefan, churches and civic groups decorate each bedroom, some in shades of blush and blue. Murals line a sunny yellow hallway, where a painted giraffe peers from one side.\n\nDownstairs, Danielle Nicholson recounted living at Paul Stefan for almost five years, back when residents were spread across different houses. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

Wade, a new beginning for maternity homes", "body": "Meryem Bakache lays her child in his bed at Mary's Shelter maternity home in Fredericksburg, Virginia, on January 5, 2024.\n\nORANGE, Va. (AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. They are there to receive housing and financial support.\n\nThere are homes, though, that continue to prioritize adoptions - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. The Lynchburg, Virginia, home was connected to an adoption agency.\n\nFrom a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house,\" she said. \"He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together.\"\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She hopes one day he might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThrough a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, a large association of anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe living space before the birth of her second child. She lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up,\" Heriot said.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open maternity homes.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which includes more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, but she thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism.\n\n\"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb,\" she said.\n\nFinding a Village\n\nDanielle Nicholson lived at Paul Stefan for almost five years. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

Wade, a new beginning for maternity homes", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nOn the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"\n\nA Painful Legacy\n\nThe heyday of American maternity homes came during the three decades before Roe, when more than 1.5 million infants were surrendered for adoption during the \"Baby Scoop Era.\" Many unwed pregnant women were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into relinquishing their babies.\n\n\"Our children were stolen,\" said Karen Wilson-Buterbaugh, who lived in a Washington, D.C., maternity home in 1966.\n\nWhen residents returned to their hometowns without a baby, they were supposed to pretend as if nothing happened.\n\nBut few could forget.\n\n\"It's a mother losing her child,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers in her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nFessler said, \"The women, especially the ones that did not feel like they had a part in the decision, live with this trauma the rest of their lives.\"\n\nHarkins said the Maternity Housing Coalition takes ownership of this history.\n\n\"We are very intentional about what happened and want to ensure we don't get to that point again,\" she said.\n\nMost residents in modern maternity homes choose to keep their children. They are there to receive housing and financial support.\n\nThere are homes, though, that continue to prioritize adoptions - which can still result in painful outcomes.\n\nAbbi Johnson was 17 in 2008 when her parents sent her to Liberty Godparent Home, founded by the late evangelical leader Jerry Falwell. The Lynchburg, Virginia, home was connected to an adoption agency.\n\nFrom a conservative Christian family, Johnson felt her unplanned pregnancy was treated as \"the most cardinal sin,\" but she still desperately wanted to parent her son.\n\n\"But everyone told me this isn't playing house,\" she said. \"He's not a doll. He deserves a married couple who has their life together.\"\n\nThe home said in a statement that every resident is educated on parenting and adoption \"and has the freedom to choose.\"\n\nIn the end, Johnson felt pressured into placing her son for adoption. She hopes one day he might know how much she misses him.\n\n\"Half my head resides in that maternity home,\" she said, \"playing the memories again and again and again.\"\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\"\n\nBefore she moved into a maternity home, Meryem Bakache considered an abortion.\n\nNewly arrived in the United States from Morocco, Bakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWithout health insurance, she looked for medical care and found an anti-abortion counseling center -- often called a crisis pregnancy center -- which provided her with an ultrasound.\n\n\"When I see my baby, just like everything changed,\" she said.\n\nThrough a friend, she found Mary's Shelter, a maternity home in Fredericksburg, an hour east of the Paul Stefan home.\n\nMany homes receive referrals from similar centers, which exist to divert women from getting abortions. The Maternity Housing Coalition, to which both Paul Stefan and Mary's Shelter belong, is a project of Heartbeat International, a large association of anti-abortion counseling centers.\n\nHolding her infant son this winter, Bakache described her relief at seeing the beauty of the quaint blue home where Mary's Shelter assigned her to live.\n\nHer housemate Jasmine Heriot had also been looking for a safe living space before the birth of her second child. She lost employment and housing after a life-threatening first pregnancy and premature birth.\n\n\"Everything was just so clean. The room was all set up,\" Heriot said.\n\nAcross the country, maternity homes are sprouting up. In Nebraska, an old college campus is becoming maternity housing. In Arizona, a home has added to one property and opened another. In Georgia, lawmakers recently made it easier to open maternity homes.\n\nMary's Shelter also recently expanded by opening another house. Like the Jameses, founder Kathleen Wilson was inspired by her Catholic and anti-abortion beliefs to begin the ministry, which includes more than 30 bedrooms in six houses and four apartments.\n\nShe is aware the anti-abortion movement is often derided as championing only unborn children, but she thinks maternity homes are one answer to that criticism.\n\n\"They defy that lie that we only care about the baby in the womb,\" she said.\n\nFinding a Village\n\nDanielle Nicholson lived at Paul Stefan for almost five years. She is one of its success stories, now raising a soon-to-be sixth grader.\n\nBut she had arrived as a surly 20-year-old, six months pregnant and feeling abandoned. \"You don't end up in a maternity home because you have a big, huge, loving village of a family,\" she said.\n\nEvelyn and Randy James became and remain like parents to her. \"Women are not numbers here. Or case files,\" she said.\n\nShe found not everyone was well-suited for the facility or parenthood, though.\n\n\"Living with the not-so-fantastic moms put something in my heart,\" Nicholson said. \"Like I need to help. How do I help women not create abused and neglected children?\"\n\nIt inspired her to become a social worker after she finished college.\n\nHer time as a case worker for vulnerable families has complicated her views of the anti-abortion movement, even though it's foundational to the maternity home that did so much for her.\n\n\"My heart was really broken when Roe v. Wade was overturned,\" she said later.\n\nShe didn't choose an abortion, and still wouldn't. But she doesn't judge those who do.\n\nAbortion is \"one of those choices that women have to face every day, for whatever reason,\" she said. \"There's grace for those women too.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A rise in premarital sex coupled with a lack of sex education and little access to contraception led to more unplanned pregnancies for unmarried women and girls. Abortion was not yet legal nationwide, and single motherhood bore a heavy social stigma.\n\nBetween the end of World War II and 1973, in what became known as the \"Baby Scoop Era,\" more than 1.5 million American infants were surrendered for adoption. An untold number of their mothers were sent away to maternity homes before giving birth.\n\nWhat was it like to live at a maternity home during this time?\n\nThe homes became places to hide unintended pregnancies. Experiences varied, but many residents were isolated from friends and family, given little information about childbirth or their legal rights. They often used aliases during their stays.\n\nMost residents were middle-class and white. Far fewer Black unmarried women placed children for adoption in the Baby Scoop Era, and many maternity homes at the time were segregated.\n\nSome maternity home residents never held their infants. Others were allowed visits for a period of time.\n\nKaren Wilson-Buterbaugh got pregnant at 17 by her boyfriend, and in 1966 her parents sent her to a Crittenton home in Washington, D.C. After birth, she spent 10 days with her daughter. Then she was given one hour to say goodbye.\n\n\"I told her all about her dad and what a great guy he was and ... that I had no way to take her home,\" she recalled. \"It was all very traumatizing.\"\n\nWere the homes religious?\n\nMany of them were. Catholic Charities and the Salvation Army both operated maternity homes. Florence Crittenton's founders had Episcopal roots. Louise Wise Services operated a home in New York for Jewish women.\n\nFor some women, the religious element of maternity homes compounded the shame they were made to feel. They describe mistreatment at the hands of nuns, priests, ministers and staff. \"We had sinned and broken the rules of society,\" Wilson-Buterbaugh said.\n\nWhat happened to former residents?\n\n\"What happened to me was the defining element in my life,\" said Francine Gurtler of her maternity home experience.\n\nPregnant after a date rape, Gurtler was 14 in 1971 when she went to St Faith's Home for Unwed Mothers, an Episcopal facility in New York. She begged to keep her son, but said, \"I was ostracized by the church-run facility that said you are not worthy of this child.\"\n\nFor Gurtler and many others, the emotional scars were lifelong.\n\n\"They had tremendous guilt and tremendous trauma,\" said Ann Fessler, who collected oral histories from Baby Scoop Era mothers for her book, \"The Girls Who Went Away.\"\n\nMany women struggled later with relationships as well their physical and mental health. Some, Fessler said, found it very painful to hear a baby cry.\n\nDNA testing has allowed more adoptees and biological parents to find each other, though reunions can still be emotionally fraught. Some former maternity home residents have become activists for reforming the adoption industry. They have fought to unseal adoption records, which remain closed in some states.\n\nWilson-Buterbaugh has watched in dismay but not surprise as maternity homes multiply again. At 75, she continues to speak and write about her unintended pregnancy in the years before Roe.\n\n\"They're hoping that all of us Baby Scoop Era mothers die,\" she said, \"and the truth of what really happened dies with us.\"\n\nWhat happened in other countries?\n\nThe social forces behind the Baby Scoop Era were evident in other Anglophone countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland, New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIreland's mother-and-baby homes were particularly grim. There has been a national reckoning over the past decade after a mass grave was uncovered at a former Catholic home in Tuam. The Irish government now estimates 9,000 infants died in 18 homes during the 20th century.\n\nSome Canadian churches have begun to examine their role in maternity homes and forced adoptions, including those of Indigenous children. In 2018, a Canadian Senate committee investigated the country's treatment of post-war unmarried mothers in a report titled, \" The Shame Is Ours.\"\n\nIn 2013, Australia's then-prime minister, Julia Gillard, delivered a landmark national apology for the country's history of forced adoptions.\n\n\"To you, the mothers - who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice - we apologize,\" she said. \"To each of you who were adopted or removed ... we say sorry.\"\n\nFurther reading\n\nAnn Fessler, \"The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v.

(AP) -- On the wall of the maternity home is the motto: \"Saving Babies, One Mom at a Time.\"\n\nFor founders Randy and Evelyn James, the home started with one baby -- their own.\n\nPaul Stefan was the last of their six children, born with a fatal condition. They had not aborted the pregnancy as doctors advised. He lived just over 40 minutes, long enough to be baptized and named after their Catholic priest.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since, the Jameses have channeled their son's memory and their anti-abortion beliefs into running maternity homes. Evelyn James said they knew they \"were going to do something for women in crisis pregnancies.\"\n\nIn August, their Paul Stefan Foundation plans to open a new floor with seven more rooms at their headquarters in a former hotel in Orange, Virginia.\n\nTheir momentum is part of a larger trend: There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion.\n\n\"It's been a significant increase,\" said Valerie Harkins, director of the Maternity Housing Coalition, an anti-abortion network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since the court's ruling.\n\nThere are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based. Anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, believing they are the next step in helping women who carry pregnancies to term.\n\nThe reasons for the surge in interest in maternity homes are complex and go beyond abortion restrictions. Harkins said unaffordable housing, paychecks cut by inflation and higher birthrates in some states have all contributed.\n\n\"It created a perfect storm,\" she said. \"There's quite a need.\"", "source": {"uri": "drgnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DRGNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jody_heemstra@drgnews.com", "name": "Jody Heemstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Stefan", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Stefan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orange, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-abortion movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baptism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Wade in June 2022.\n\n\"There has been a nationwide expansion of maternity homes in the two years since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and the federal right to abortion,\" wrote AP religion reporter Tiffany Stanley.\n\nStanley quoted Maternity Housing Coalition (MHC) Director Valerie Harkins, who called the growth of maternity homes across the country \"a significant increase.\"\n\nIn her role, Harkins oversees a \"network of 195 maternity homes that has grown 23% since\" the Supreme Court's ruling in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, Stanley reported.\n\nMHC is part of Heartbeat International, the largest network of pregnancy resource centers (PRCs) in the world.\n\nClick here to sign up for pro-life news alerts from LifeNews.com\n\n\"There are now more than 450 maternity homes in the U.S., according to Harkins; many of them are faith-based,\" wrote Stanley:\n\nAs abortion restrictions increase, anti-abortion advocates want to open more of these transitional housing facilities, which often have long waitlists. It's part of what they see as the next step in preventing abortions and providing long-term support for low-income pregnant women and mothers.\n\nStanley devoted a large segment of her article to what she called the \"painful legacy\" of maternity homes.\n\nIn another AP article, also published on Friday, Stanley similarly referred to the \"checkered\" legacy of maternity homes.\n\n\"Maternity homes also have a fraught history of trauma, secrecy and shame,\" Stanley claimed in the second piece:\n\nIn the three decades before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion nationwide, many unwed pregnant women and girls were sent to maternity homes, where they were often coerced into surrendering their babies for adoption.\n\nHowever, as Stanley noted, many of the maternity homes she referred to date back to the Progressive Era and are unrelated to present-day maternity homes such as the ones Harkins oversees.\n\nHarkins told the AP that maternity homes serve to support \"women in following through on their yes to carry that pregnancy to term,\" whether \"that's a yes that they chose or maybe they felt like they didn't have a choice.\"\n\nPro-life advocates often cite the success of maternity homes to push back on the pro-abortion narrative that the pro-life movement is only \"pro-birth\" and does not care about mothers after they give birth.\n\nIn her initial report, Stanley recounted the case of Meryem Bakache, who with her newborn son moved into Mary's Center, a Fredericksburg, Virginia, maternity home that is part of Harkins' MHC network. Backache had previously considered abortion.\n\n\"Newly arrived in the United States from Morocco,\" Stanley wrote,\n\nBakache spoke little English and lived in a crowded apartment with family in northern Virginia while her husband attended college in West Virginia.\n\n\"Where can I live with this baby?\" she recalled thinking. \"What can I give him? I don't have nothing.\"\n\nWhile pregnant, Bakache came across a pro-life PRC that gave her a free ultrasound.

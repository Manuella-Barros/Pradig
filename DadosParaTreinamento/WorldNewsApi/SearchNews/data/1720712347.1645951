Enter the \u201chospital facility fee\u201d: a charge hospitals can add to bills from doctors\u2019 offices, outpatient surgical clinics and diagnostics centers that they own, rebranding them as \u201coutpatient hospital departments\u201d, even if the facility is miles from a hospital campus. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most egregious examples of hospital financing at the expense of consumers,\u201d said Liz Hagan, director of policy solutions at the United States of Care, a non-profit advocacy group that released a new report on the practice. The report, \u201cBehind the Bill\u201d argues that \u201chospitals are at the center of a massive market failure\u201d, where consolidation is driving price hikes for patients. There is no data on how often people are hit with the charges. But it\u2019s widespread enough that one of US of Care\u2019s own staff members was charged while writing the report \u2013 a facility fee of $154.52 was added to a bill for a flu test. \u201cUltimately, consumers are left paying the price for that \u2013 either through higher [insurance] premiums, because hospital costs are built into premium costs, or at the point of service,\u201d Hagan said. Facility fees are rooted in how hospitals have historically billed patients. For decades, hospital bills have been broken into two parts \u2013 \u201cprofessional fees\u201d charged by doctors and \u201cfacility fees\u201d charged by institutions. Trade groups such as the American Hospital Association have lobbied against efforts to rein in facility fees. \u201cThe cost of care delivered in hospitals and health systems \u2013 and any associated sites of care operated by the hospital \u2013 takes into account the many unique services that only they provide to their communities,\u201d the American Hospital Association (AHA), a trade group, said. \u201cThis includes the costs of maintaining standby capacity for traumatic events and delivering 24/7 care to all who come through the emergency department, regardless of ability to pay or insurance status.\u201d Prohibiting facility fees would constitute \u201csubstantial and unprecedented cuts to hospitals\u201d, they argue. The AHA also argues that private equity, not hospitals, are purchasing the majority of physicians groups. What is not in dispute is accelerated consolidation in healthcare, and how facility fees have increased alongside. As of 2022, 41% of doctor\u2019s offices are now affiliated with hospitals, up from 29% in 2012, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cWe have data showing, for the same service, hospital fees are about 150% higher than ambulatory surgical centers in the same county,\u201d said Ge Bai, a healthcare accounting professor at Johns Hopkins Carey School of Business, referring to a 2023 research letter published in Jama Health Forum. An ambulatory surgical center is any clinic that provides surgical services outside of a hospital. One study, which used data from private insurers, found 10% of physician practices were bought in a six-year period from 2006-2013. In that study, merging with a hospital led to an average 14.1% price increase. Notably, facility fees are often impossible to anticipate or estimate. They can range \u201cfrom $0 to thousands, without any relationship to the particular service being provided,\u201d according to the journal Health Affairs. In just one example of how facility fees vary, a study of Florida hospitals found facility fees ranged from $5,213 to $15,759, with for-profit hospitals charging the most. That study\u2019s author, a Miami emergency room physician, Dr Tony Zitek, said he chose the topic because he believes fees should be transparent. His own mother was hit with a facility fee at a clinic \u2013 she was \u201cvery annoyed\u201d, he said. \u201cMy mom goes to hospital-based clinics, and then [was] surprised by a facility fee,\u201d said Zitek. Patients can \u201cgo to another clinic that offers exactly the same service and you don\u2019t get that fee\u201d. Critics argue government policy incentivizes consolidation. Care provided by hospitals is paid more by Medicare and Medicaid, public health insurance programs which cover seniors, the disabled and low-income Americans \u2013 115 million Americans together. Once a clinic is purchased by a hospital, it can be reclassified as an \u201coutpatient hospital department\u201d \u2013 then a \u201cfacility fee\u201d can be charged. Large hospital groups can also demand more money from private health insurers \u2013 the companies that provide care to Americans through their employer \u2013 because they are now more essential to have in an insurer\u2019s network. The AHA argues that insurers, not hospitals, are responsible for price hikes by concocting complicated reimbursement schemes, such as one recently revealed with a company called Multiplan. Facility fees have attracted the attention of bipartisan state lawmakers. However, despite growing consolidation and concern over how hospitals have leveraged their status to increase payments, Congress ditched reforms in February, according to Stat. Authors of the report by US of Care called on legislators to stop paying more to hospital-affiliated doctor\u2019s offices, require reporting on facility fees and facility fee disclosure in bills, noting: \u201cIn many ways, hospital facility fees \u2026 and the growing affordability burden they are placing on patients are the symptoms of rampant provider consolidation.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Hospitals adding charge to bills from doctors\u2019 offices, outpatient surgical clinics and diagnostic centers they own</p><p>Hospitals are gobbling up doctor\u2019s offices \u2013 and they\u2019re bringing higher prices to patients when they do, even if a patient never sets foot on a hospital campus.</p><p>Enter the \u201chospital facility fee\u201d: a charge hospitals can add to bills from doctors\u2019 offices, outpatient surgical clinics and diagnostics centers that they own, rebranding them as \u201coutpatient hospital departments\u201d, even if the facility is miles from a hospital campus.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/09/patients-charged-hospital-facility-fees\">Continue reading...</a>", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jun/09/patients-charged-hospital-facility-fees", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb080ecb61a83d69b2910312b8a81850b662f657/0_208_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGV", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:00:18", "author": "Jessica Glenza", "authors": ["Jessica Glenza"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.163}

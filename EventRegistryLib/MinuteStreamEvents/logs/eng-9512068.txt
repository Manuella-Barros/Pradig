It's these religious landmarks that forced advertising icon Walter Mendez to come up with 'God's own country' catchphrase for Kerala Tourism in 1989.\n\nWhile Pathanamthitta's landmarks of faith have remained unchanged for several centuries, in recent years, it's the political landmarks of this constituency that have undergone a significant change. The constituency has been a bastion of Congress-led alliances since its formation in 2008.

I am expecting a significant win for the party in Pathanamthitta. This time when we win more than 370 seats for the party and 400 seats for the alliance, I am very much sure that one of them is going to be this constituency,\" he said.\n\nThe BJP had already made inroads into the Nair community with the tacit support of key community welfare organisation Nair Service Society.

Congress' Anto Antony seeks a fourth win, facing BJP's Anil K Antony, who switched from Congress, and LDF's Thomas Issac, aiming to convert assembly dominance to a Parliament seat. Congress highlights ousting Modi, while LDF emphasizes anti-BJP stance. Anil K Antony aims to build on BJP's 2019 votes. The election is seen as a test of Congress-LDF-BJP dynamics in the region.Pathanamthitta, home to Sabarimala, has several grand churches lining its highways. This Lok Sabha constituency in Kerala is seeing an exciting election battle between three known Christian candidates, the dominant social group here.\n\nThe BJP heavily invested in this traditionally Congress constituency in 2019 by capitalising on the Sabarimala temple issue. The Left, which never won this LS seat, controls all seven assembly segments, showing how assembly and parliament elections vary.\n\nLocal Congress player Anto Antony seeks his fourth consecutive win. In the national spotlight was Anil K Antony, son of Congress leader AK Antony, who abruptly switched to the BJP. His background helped him rise quickly in the BJP, but now he must cope with electoral dynamism and turn headlines into votes. The Left has fielded former state finance minister Thomas Issac, a senior CPI-M leader, to convert the Left Democratic Front's hold in assembly segments here to a Parliament seat and end his political sidelining after the last assembly polls' surprise denial of a party ticket.\n\nCongress' campaign stresses on the importance of equipping the party with maximum MPs in order to oust Modi and repeatedly reminds locals of the violence that Christians endured in BJP-ruled Manipur.\n\n\"The entire Congress party and the UDF are working like a well-oiled machine to ensure the victory of Anto Antony. The huge response Priyanka Gandhi received when she campaigned here showed our supporters enthusiasm and confidence,\" district Congress president Satheesh Kochuparambil told ET.\n\nThe LDF has effectively campaigned for Isaac by highlighting the \"dangers\" of the BJP, broadcasting the Left's principled struggle against BJP \"unlike an undependable Congress\". \"LDF victories in all Pathanamthitta assembly seats will now be extended to the Lok Sabha seat. The presence of practicing politicians-cum-intellectuals like Thomas Isaac in the Lok Sabha will elevate Parliament discourse, said LDF leader Varghese George.\n\nIsaac must overcome two challenges: the local Christian population's (and others') preference for the Congress over the Left in Lok Sabha elections, and the palpable resentment against the LDF government's incumbency and chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's style of ruling.\n\nWhile Anil K Antony's task is to build on the 2.97 lakh votes that BJP's K Surendran polled here in 2019. \"The sitting Congress MP here is bogged down by incumbency. While the Left candidate (Isaac) is a senior. This election is also taking place when the LDF government has even defaulted on payment of (welfare) pensions. I arrived here as a new BJP candidate, but we have a confident campaign and I have communicated my vision for Pathanamthitta development to the people,\" Anil K Antony told ET.\n\nThe Anil K Antony-led BJP push also met with a dramatic response when his 83-year-old father, AK Antony, still the Congress' high-priest in Kerala even after his withdrawal from parliamentary politics, made a public assertion that his BJP candidate son should lose against Anto Antony.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabarimala_Temple", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sabarimala Temple"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_Democratic_Front", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Left Democratic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Antony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

Once, it was a party that used to have 400-plus seats; now, you have one-tenth of (those) seats.\"\n\nMore and more people are leaving the Congress because it's cut off from reality, reiterated the BJP candidate.\n\nFormer defence minister and Kerala chief minister A.K. Antony is one of the Congress veterans recognised as a strong critic of the BJP-led Central government. A.K. Antony has already said his son should not win as a BJP candidate from Pathanamthitta, endorsing Congress candidate and sitting MP Anto Antony.\n\nAnil, the former national coordinator and convenor of All Indian Congress Committee (AICC) social media and digital communications, joined the BJP in April 2023, two months after he quit the Congress.\n\nIn this Lok Sabha polls, Anil will contest from Pathanamthitta, considered one of the BJP's \"A-class\" seats in Kerala since the party managed to win nearly 30% of the votes from the constitueny in the last elections. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched Anil's campaign on March 15, a day before the election commission announced the poll dates.\n\nThe BJP candidate, however, is not seeing his first election as a challenge. \"Everybody has to fight their first election sometime. That is part of the process,\" said Anil, adding he has been used to a political atmosphere since childhood.\n\nAlso read: Seven hurdles BJP faces in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and how they're playing out in 2024 polls\n\nFielded from the heartland of the 2008 Sabarimala protests, which ended in the Supreme Court ending an 18-year-old restriction on women of menstrual age from entering the shrine, Anil will face off with two seasoned politicians in his maiden electoral battle.\n\nWhile the Left Democratic Front (LDF) has fielded senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and former Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, United Democratic Front (UDF) has fielded three-time MP Anto Antony from the party bastion again.\n\nHowever, Anil said he is confident of a victory, claiming that the LDF and UDF, part of the INDIA bloc, follow the \"same politics of extreme appeasement of certain minorities\".\n\nThe BJP leader alleged that both parties are engaged in vote bank politics and have disregarded the sentiments of the majority.\n\n\"We (BJP) are for everybody. We are for 140 crore people. We want to ensure that we move forward to become a developed country. But we do follow the route of law,\" he said.\n\n\"The Congress left because of their appeasement politics -- they started treating the majority... they started disregarding. Let's say the sentiment of the majority is not their concern. All their politics revolve around appeasing certain minorities -- that's vote bank politics. It's not something that we encourage,\" he added.\n\nAnil said Kerala is seeing a rise in radical ideas, and it is in the BJP's and country's best interests to ensure these do not ruin the state.\n\nThe BJP leader has made claims about Kerala's radicalism earlier as well, and Kerala Police have booked him in some of these instances.\n\nIn October 2023, the Kasaragod district cyber cell booked Anil over a social media post, showing a video of Muslim students arguing with other women, with the caption \"no bus rides without a burqa in northern Kerala\". Later, it was revealed the students were angry as the bus did not stop where they wanted to get out. Anil has since deleted his post.\n\nTwo months later, the leader was again booked for promoting enmity and spreading misinformation about the blasts that killed three at the international convention centre in Kochi's Kalamassery.\n\nAlso read: SDPI offers support for Lok Sabha polls in Kerala. But here's why Congress is caught in quandary\n\nLocated in the southern part of Kerala, the Pathanamthitta Lok Sabha seat has never voted for any other political party but the UDF since 2009, the year of the formation of the constituency.\n\nThe constituency comprises five assembly segments, Thiruvalla, Ranni, Aranmula, Konni, and Adoor, in the Pathanamthitta district and two Kanjirappally and Poonjar in neighbouring Kottayam district.\n\nCongress's Anto Antony won the seat in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections with 380,927 votes, followed by CPI(M)'s Veena George with 3,36,684 votes. BJP chief K. Surendran, the BJP's face of the Sabarimala protests, won 2,97,396 votes -- a 28.97 percent share. Surendran has moved to Wayanad to contest against Rahul Gandhi and the Communist Party of India's Annie Raja this election.\n\nKottayam district has a 49.81 percent Hindu population, followed by 43.48 percent Christians and 6.41 percent Muslims, and Pathanamthitta has 56.28 percent Hindus, 39.03 percent Christians, and 4.58 percent Muslims, according to the 2011 Census.\n\nAnil might help the BJP win over Christian voters in the constituency.\n\nAnil, however, told ThePrint, \"BJP is not trying to reach out to any one community or any particular community. We are trying to reach out to every single Indian.\"\n\nThe opposition parties have created a narrative about the BJP being anti-Christian, but the party is in power in many states like Goa, which has the highest number of Christian voters, Anil said.\n\nKerala is the \"aberration and exception\", but the ground reality is changing slowly, added Anil.\n\n\"Yesterday, the Believers (Eastern) Church supported us (Anil in Pathanamthitta). Publically, this is the first time the church supported a BJP candidate. This is a start. Over time, more and more churches will support us,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aneesa_pa@theprint.in", "name": "Aneesa Pa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Antony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

He is up against BJP's Anil K Antony, whose decision to join the saffron party dealt a big blow to his father and Congress veteran AK Antony's legacy. LDF's TM Thomas Isaac is also hoping to gain a foothold in the region where the Left has seen a political surge in the last few years.\n\nNotably, Christians make up nearly 40% of Pathanamthitta's population and hold significant sway in the political landscape of the constituency. Unsurprisingly, all three major candidates are from the Christian community, indicating the importance of this voting bloc.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has made efforts to connect with the Christian community during his visits to the state, including recalling his interaction with Pope Francis and highlighting the government's successful intervention in rescuing a priest from ISIS captivity. These actions are part of the BJP's broader strategy to appeal to Christian voters and expand its traditional Hindu support base.\n\nThe BJP, which saw a significant increase in its vote share in the 2019 elections due to the Sabarimala temple issue, continues to focus on this theme. The party has been vocal about the alleged mismanagement of the Sabarimala shrine by the LDF government, especially criticising the inadequate facilities provided to pilgrims recently. In addition to religious issues, the BJP is reaching out to the local agricultural community, particularly rubber farmers, by promising better incentives for rubber sheet exports, directly countering the policies of the Left government.\n\nThe UDF's electoral dynamics have been made more complex by controversial remarks made by Anto Antony about the Pulwama attack. The BJP and CPM have used these comments to their advantage.\n\nIn fact, Anil Antony's all-out offensive on his father's party has caused embarrassment to AK Antony and generated a lot of buzz in the run up to the elections. Anil Antony provocatively suggested that the Congress should move to Pakistan and said the grand old party is cut off from India's socio-political and cultural realities. He even said that people has completed rejected Congress.\n\nAnto Antony responded to the accusations regarding his statement on Pakistan's involvement in Pulwama by criticising the BJP for using divisive tactics reminiscent of \"Hitler's regime\". He also highlighted historical instances of what he views as betrayals by the BJP and RSS during India's freedom struggle.\n\nMeanwhile, CPM's Thomas Isaac is facing legal woes with the Enforcement Directorate scrutinising alleged irregularities related to the issuance of masala bonds during his tenure as the state finance minister. Isaac has dismissed these allegations as politically motivated attempts to derail his campaign.\n\nCatch LIVE updates of 2024 Lok Sabha election here.\n\nThe local sentiment is mixed despite vigorous campaigns and controversies. There is increased visibility for the CPM in the region. However, many locals still believe that Anto Antony might secure a win again, given his longstanding connection to the constituency and the region's traditional stronghold of the Congress party. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the UDF won the seat with a substantial margin. However, the 2021 state assembly elections saw the LDF making significant gains, capturing all Assembly segments in the district.\n\nThe Believers Church in Pathanamthitta has publicly endorsed Anil Antony, marking the first time a church body in Kerala has supported the party. This endorsement, announced during a large gathering organised by the Believers Eastern Church in Thiruvalla and attended by over 100 priests, including Mar Silvanious, the Metropolitan of Kerala, and Church PRO Rev. Father Sijo Panthapallil, could potentially influence the voting patterns of the Christian community.\n\nThe Believers Church in Thiruvananthapuram has also supported Rajiv Chandrasekhar, indicating a closer alliance with the BJP.\n\nPathanamthitta encompasses seven assembly constituencies, including Kanjirappally and Poonjar from the neighbouring Kottayam district. The region is also known for its traditional festivals, such as the snake boat races in Aranmula and the unique craft of metal mirrors known as Aranmula Kannadi.\n\nThe political landscape in Pathanamthitta has been primarily dominated by Congress, as evidenced by consistent victories in previous Lok Sabha elections. However, as the 2024 elections approach, the BJP is intensifying its efforts to challenge this dominance while LDF is hoping to dislodge UDF. A keen three-way battle is on the cards on April 26.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christians", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christians"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anto_Antony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anto Antony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Antony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

Firefighters and veterinarians climbed onto the partially submerged roof, sedated and immobilized the horse and then lay it on an inflatable raft - all 770lbs of it. The operation involved four inflatable boats and four support vessels, with firefighters, soldiers and other volunteers.\n\n\"We found the animal in a debilitated state,\" Capt Tiago Franco, a firefighter from Sao Paulo deployed to lead the rescue, was quoted as saying in a statement from that state's security secretariat. \"We tried to approach in a calm way.\"\n\nThe floods have destroyed infrastructure and bridges, blocking access to Porto Alegre, where supermarket shelves are empty and looting has been reported at night.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite said initial calculations indicate that Rio Grande do Sul will need at least 19bn reais ($3.68bn) to rebuild from the damage, which has extended into farm areas around the capital.\n\n\"The effect of the floods and the extent of the tragedy are devastating,\" he said on social media.\n\nThe stranded horse is just one of many animals rescue workers have been striving to save in recent days. Rio Grande do Sul state agents have rescued about 10,000 animals since last week, while those in municipalities and volunteers have saved thousands more, according to the state's housing secretariat.\n\nAnimal protection groups and volunteers have been sharing images of difficult rescues and heartwarming scenes of pets reuniting with their owners on social media.

Firefighters and veterinarians climbed onto the partially submerged roof, sedated and immobilized the horse and then lay it on an inflatable raft - all 770lbs of it. The operation involved four inflatable boats and four support vessels, with firefighters, soldiers and other volunteers.\n\n\"We found the animal in a debilitated state,\" Capt Tiago Franco, a firefighter from Sao Paulo deployed to lead the rescue, was quoted as saying in a statement from that state's security secretariat. \"We tried to approach in a calm way.\"\n\nThe floods have destroyed infrastructure and bridges, blocking access to Porto Alegre, where supermarket shelves are empty and looting has been reported at night.\n\nGovernor Eduardo Leite said initial calculations indicate that Rio Grande do Sul will need at least 19bn reais ($3.68bn) to rebuild from the damage, which has extended into farm areas around the capital.\n\n\"The effect of the floods and the extent of the tragedy are devastating,\" he said on social media.\n\nThe stranded horse is just one of many animals rescue workers have been striving to save in recent days.

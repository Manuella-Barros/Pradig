It's unclear at this point if Gray will require Tommy John surgery, an internal brace, or some combination thereof.\n\nGray, 26, will end his season having made just two appearances at the big-league level earlier this year. He was out on a rehab assignment as recently as late June, but suffered a setback that revealed itself as this injury. Our Mike Axisa explained the internal brace procedure last year in relation to Shohei Ohtani:\n\nA relatively new procedure -- an internal brace -- is an alternative to Tommy John surgery when the tear is located close to the bone. The internal brace procedure is much less invasive than Tommy John surgery and comes with a shorter rehab, though it still fairly lengthy. To be clear, it is unknown whether Ohtani will have the internal brace or a different procedure.\n\nOriginally acquired as part of the Max Scherzer trade at the 2021 deadline, Gray has matured into a quality starter for the Nationals. Last season, he posted a 3.91 ERA (109 ERA+) and a 1.79 strikeout-to-walk ratio while making his first All-Star Game appearance. For Gray's career, he's sporting a 4.84 ERA (85 ERA+) in nearly 400 innings.\n\nThe Nationals entered Friday with a 44-53 record on the season, putting them 18 1/2 games back in the National League East and six games back in the wild-card race. The Nationals had encountered some turbulence heading into the break, running a 5-9 start to July that included losses in six of their final eight games.\n\nThe Nationals will resume their season on Friday against the Cincinnati Reds.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_j_anderson@cbssports.com", "name": "R.J.

Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports / Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWashington Nationals right-handed pitcher Josiah Gray, once a top prospect in the Los Angeles Dodgers' organization, has a partially torn UCL and will have season-ending surgery next week, he told reporters on Friday. Gray said he doesn't know if he'll need a full Tommy John surgery or internal brace, but he will miss the rest of this season and some of next season.\n\nGray, 26, was only able to make two starts this season, and he struggled, allowing 13 earned runs across 8.1 innings of work. He then was placed on the injured list in early April with a flexor strain, and was transferred to the 60-day IL in early July.\n\nNow, Gray's season is officially over, and he faces a long rehab and recovery before he's able to return to a mound.\n\nGray was drafted by the Cincinnati Reds in the second round of the 2018 MLB Draft. He was then traded to the Dodgers along with Jeter Downs and Homer Bailey in a massive salary dump trade that sent Matt Kemp, Yasiel Puig, Alex Wood, and Kyle Farmer out.\n\nGray debuted with the Dodgers in 2021, and made two appearances with L.A. before being one of the headliners in a blockbuster trade that brought Max Scherzer and Trea Turner to Los Angeles at the trade deadline. Gray, the Dodgers' No. 2 prospect at the time, was traded along with Keibert Ruiz (the No. 1 prospect), Donovan Casey, and Gerardo Carrilo.\n\nAfter struggling in 2022, Gray had his best season in 2023, sporting a 3.91 ERA across 159 innings of work. He even made the All-Star team after a first half in which he had a 3.41 ERA across 100.1 innings.\n\nGray will now be on the shelf for the next year or so, which is a big blow for him and the Nationals.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Gray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josiah Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeter_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeter Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keibert_Ruiz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keibert Ruiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Farmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Farmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wood_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Wood (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kemp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Kemp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homer Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Scherzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasiel_Puig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yasiel Puig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trea_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trea Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3720,h_2092,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_dodgers/01j366erzcpdjk8pnbsv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9748092", "eventUri": "eng-9748092", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

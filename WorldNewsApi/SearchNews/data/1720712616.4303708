Gomo II has described the Kebbi State Governor, Dr. Nasir Idris,Kauran Gwandu as.a person who has passion to work and a person who is sympathetic to the plight of people. The monarch made the assertion during a visit to his Palace in Zuru by the Commissioner of Information and Culture Kebbi State, Alhaji Yakubu Ahmed Birnin Kebbi recently. The Emir, throughout his remarks was very kind in his summation of the achievements of Dr. Nasir Idris\u2019s administration in just one year in office. He said even though the state was governed by different Governors who came and left with their styles of leadership in addressing developmental challenges , no governor had confronted those challenges head on than the incumbent governor, Dr. Nasir Idris. \u201d We are lucky to have a person with passion to work, a person who is sympathetic to the plight of people. \u201dKebbi State had different leaders who came and left scatching just the problems of our state. But Kauran Gwandu does not belief so. \u2018 He believes in confronting the challenges head on, and look at what he has achieved in one year, which many could not achieve in 8 years, \u201d he emphasised. Gomo further described Idris as a focused planner who analyses his plans to achieve optimum results. \u201d He sits down ,analyse, plan and work to achieve results, which is good for a leader and is what a leader supposed to do . \u201d Look at what he has done in the state capital, a lot of construction, look at the ultra-modern Secretariat for the workers and many others,\u201d he said. The Emir reiterated the unflinching support of the State traditional institution,the civil service, the army and para military agencies to the governor, saying \u2018 we are proud of him and we will continue to pray for him to succeed.\u201d He called on the governor not to be distracted by detractors or naysayers as he was on course to take Kebbi State to the promise land. On security, the royal father described as unfortunate how his Emirate found itself in the middle of the insecurity saga between Zamfara and Niger state which claimed many lives and the loss of lives and the destruction of the property of his people. \u201c\u2018 This is an unfortunate development in my emirate ,we are in the middle enveloped between the two trouble spots, Zamfara and Niger States. \u2018 Spill over of criminals try to find safe haven , they ran to Zuru Emirate for safety. That is the genesis of our security problem.\u201d He commended the governor for his prompt action in tackling the security situation in his Emirate, which according to him restored peace and calm making the farmers to return to their farmlands who had hitherto ran away as a result of the activities of bandits. \u2018 The governor did not waste time, when he came ,few months in office, he immediately went into action. Farmers are back to their farms and many markets business have picked up. \u201d I can say that the governor is working like a Field General when it comes to security, he maps out strategies and they are working,\u201dhe commended.", "summary": "<div style=\"margin-bottom:20px;\"><img width=\"1003\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0055.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0055.jpg 1003w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0055-300x215.jpg 300w, https://independent.ng/wp-content/uploads/IMG-20240609-WA0055-768x551.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1003px) 100vw, 1003px\" /></div>BIRNIN- KEBBI &#8211; The Emir of Zuru, General (Rtd) Mohammed Sani Sami.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service. Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@eagletribune.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "will_weissert@eagletribune.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@eagletribune.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette_Square,_Washington,_D.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci, Pool)\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered a solemn call to voters to defend the country's democracy as he laid out in an Oval Office address his decision to drop his bid for reelection and throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nInsisting that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden used his first public address since his announcement Sunday that he was stepping aside to deliver an implicit repudiation of former President Donald Trump. He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service. Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played,", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do.

Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy che\n\nmical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's sp\n\neech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib h\n\nolds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ah\n\nead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not play\n\ning around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily members\n\nof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000\n\nprotestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke to\n\na roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "wxow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXOW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wxow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

AP-Yonhap\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered a solemn call to voters to defend the country's democracy as he laid out in an Oval Office address his decision to drop his bid for reelection and throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nInsisting that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden used his first public address since his announcement Sunday that he was stepping aside to deliver an implicit repudiation of former President Donald Trump. He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, left, stands next to U.S. First Lady Jill Biden as he thanks the camera crew after addressing the nation about his decision to not seek reelection, in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C., July 24. AFP-Yonhap\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nU.S. Vice President and Democratic Presidential candidate Kamala Harris waves as she boards Air Force Two at Indianapolis International Airport in Indianapolis, Ind., July 24. AFP-Yonhap\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren.

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nBiden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy che\n\nmical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's sp\n\neech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib h\n\nolds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ah\n\nead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not play\n\ning around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily members\n\nof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000\n\nprotestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke to\n\na roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "pantagraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pantagraph.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pantagraph.com", "name": "Associated

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.", "source": {"uri": "wxow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXOW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wxow.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@wxow.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@wxow.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do.

But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy che\n\nmical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's sp\n\neech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib h\n\nolds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ah\n\nead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not play\n\ning around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily members\n\nof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000\n\nprotestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke to\n\na roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"\n\nFOX28 Spokane\u00a9", "source": {"uri": "fox28spokane.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 28 Spokane"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

And that includes personal ambition.\" Biden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign. Biden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\" Biden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\" Biden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it. Biden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down. Biden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played. Biden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later. Trump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border. Biden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president. Families of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed. Trump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota. Trump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum. Police remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate. Access to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance. Tempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray. Sen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Hostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon. Protesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse. ... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\" 'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station. All 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised. Police deploy che mical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes. 'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause. Netanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\" 'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough. A tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates. People wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself. Arrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear. Netanyahu's sp eech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values. RNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans. US Rep. Tlaib h olds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians. Netanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\" Police deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said. Netanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. More than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war. Protesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ah ead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. US Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war. Netanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol. 'We are not play ing around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday. Family members of Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said. Vance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\" Senate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said. 2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced. Mother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7. Cease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week. More than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address. Protestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol. More than 1,000 protestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\n___\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu. Netanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\" Protestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones. The scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones. Senators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday. Marianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year. Biden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address Protests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit GOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\" Trump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. Harris spoke to a roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign Harris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition. Harris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid. Democrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination. Families of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service. Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played,\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nBiden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy chemical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's speech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib holds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not playing around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily membersof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000 protestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke toa roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Biden is returning to the White House from his Rehoboth Beach home recovering from COVID-19 and after ending his 2024 campaign. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered a solemn call to voters to defend the country's democracy as he laid out in an Oval Office address his decision to drop his bid for reelection and throw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris. Insisting that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title,\"\u009d Biden used his first public address since his announcement Sunday that he was stepping aside to deliver an implicit repudiation of former President Donald Trump. He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\u009d It was a moment for the history books - a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War. \"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\u009d Trump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\u009d Biden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job. Biden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\"\u009d Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\u009d He added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\u009d It was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders - and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside. Biden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things. The president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office. \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\"\u009d Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\u009d Biden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration. His advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\"\u009d and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself. Harris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do.

She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a sombre coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a US president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.\n\nHis refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats.\n\nLawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the scepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfilment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on January 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris' advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticised for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures.

It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job. Biden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters. On Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\u009d Biden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. The president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name. \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do.

His advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself. Harris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nLowes Foods to shutter a Moncks Corner grocery store Cafe Strudel owners are opening a new restaurant and market on Lake Murray Decades-old furniture store in Columbia's Vista set to close its doors Georgetown County wants to turn conservation land into homes.

But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

Now is the time to make way for those newer, younger voices, he said, like that of Harris, whom he has endorsed for the nomination.\n\nThough he did not mention Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump by name, Biden has referred to Trump as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" the president said. \"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nBiden hinted that he had arrived at the decision to drop out in part because of doubts over whether he could defeat Trump.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" the president said. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\nBiden took a moment to reflect and marvel at where his life had begun, long before his 51-year-long political journey.\n\n\"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton and Claymont one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" he said. \"But here I am. That's what's so special about America.\"\n\nThe president expressed his gratitude to the American people, and praised the country as a nation of possibilities.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,\" he said, adding, \"I have given my heart and my soul to so many nation, like so many others. I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am, to all of you.\"\n\nFor the remaining six months of his term, Biden said he plans to focus on the job of the presidency. He plans to continue to try to lower costs for families, defend personal freedoms, protect the right to vote, and fight against cancer. He said he also plans to continue to speak out against gun violence, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nAbroad, the president said he would continue to make NATO stronger, support Ukraine's fight for freedom, and work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nMr. Biden, who ran on the idea that democracy itself was at stake in 2020 and is again in 2024 with Trump as the Republican nominee, reminded Americans that they are the ones who will determine America's destiny: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nThe president also listed what he believes are his greatest achievements, including lowering the racial wealth gap, passing bipartisan infrastructure funding, achieving wins against big Pharma, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, compensating veterans exposed to toxic materials and putting the first African American woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nWhite House staffers gathered across the White House to watch the president's remarks.\n\nDemocrats have fallen in line behind Harris, after Biden endorsed her for the nomination soon after announcing he would end his campaign. Biden cannot appoint a successor for the Democratic nomination, but since his announcement on Sunday, Harris has secured the endorsements of a majority of Democratic delegates.\n\nThe president has said little since his decision while he recovered from COVID-19 symptoms at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The White House said Tuesday that he had tested negative, and Biden told reporters upon his return from Delaware that he's feeling \"well.\"\n\nOval Office addresses are rare for a president, including for Biden. Before last week, Biden had only delivered two Oval Office addresses in his three-and-a-half years as president. Last week, he delivered his third Oval Office address, following the assassination attempt against former President Trump.\n\nAlthough Biden plans to participate in the campaign, stepping down from the Democratic ticket allows him to focus on the task of the presidency itself, away from the physically taxing campaign trail.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the president told his campaign staff -- who are now Harris' campaign staff -- Monday. \"I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as -- and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, is among the most critical of not just Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.", "source": {"uri": "etonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Tonight"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2024-07/biden.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

It will also give Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\n\"The defence of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden will say, according to excerpts released by the White House. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people.

I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as -- and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, is among the most critical of not just Mr. Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/25/f2bbc71c-7991-4226-b918-f90f93ec2456/thumbnail/1200x630g2/fbf35d52cf4a018168334bb40a57e497/gettyimages-2162706300.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Later in the day, a 15-year-old was arrested for assaulting a police officer in front of Union Station.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags, lit one ablaze and hoisted Palestinian flags in their place to massive cheers in the crowd.\n\nThree men were also arrested for assaulting a police officer and crossing a police line in Columbus Circle, outside Union Station, police said.\n\nDefending his tenure, Biden said his \"record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term.\" But, he said, \"I needed to unite my party.\"\n\nContrasting himself with Trump, he added, \"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\n___\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "hosted.ap.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Associated Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden ended his campaign for a second term on Sunday after weeks of pressure from nervous Democrats and major donors, who feared he would lose to former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's withdrawal threw the presidential race into unchartered territory just four months before the election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris quickly announced that she would run for president, and Biden offered her his endorsement. Harris has since raised more than $126 million for her nascent campaign and has already secured more than enough delegates to win the party's nomination.\n\nFull-blown crisis: An inside look at Biden campaign's pitfalls.\n\nIn a letter announcing his decision to pull out of the race, Biden said while it had always been his intention to run for a second term, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nThe pressure on Biden to drop out started to build after a disastrous debate with Trump last month raised questions about his physical and mental acuity and his ability to serve another four-year term. But the White House insisted Monday, just a few hours before Biden's speech, that concerns about his health had nothing to do with his decision to exit the race.\n\n'A brave act': Americans react to President Biden's historic decision\n\nIn his remarks, Biden made it clear he plans to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\nBiden said he plans to spend the next six months doing his job as president - working to lower costs for families, growing the economy and defending personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\nHe said he would continue rallying a coalition of allies to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine and would keep working to end the war in Gaza and bring peace to the Middle East.\n\nBiden said he would also continue to pursue Supreme Court reform and his \"Moonshot\" program to end cancer.\n\nA natural successor: As President Joe Biden steps aside, is America ready for President Kamala Harris?\n\nThe United States remains a nation of \"promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers,\" he said.\n\nWhile Biden spoke, first lady Jill Biden, son Hunter Biden and other members of his family watched from chairs along the Oval Office's curved walls.\n\nIn a veiled reference to the upcoming election, Biden gave a shoutout to Harris, saying she had been an incredible partner and a leader for the country.\n\n\"She's experienced,\" he said. \"She's tough.

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nBiden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy chemical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's speech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib holds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not playing around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily membersof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000protestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke toa roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Now is the time to make way for those newer, younger voices, he said, like that of Harris, whom he has endorsed for the nomination.\n\nThough he did not mention Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump by name, Mr. Biden has referred to Trump as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" the president said. \"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nMr. Biden hinted that he had arrived at the decision to drop out in part because of doubts over whether he could defeat Trump.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" the president said. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\nThe president expressed his gratitude to the American people, and praised the country as a nation of possibilities.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,\" he said, adding, \"I have given my heart and my soul to so many nation, like so many others. I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am, to all of you.\"\n\nFor the remaining six months of his term, Mr. Biden said he plans to focus on the job of the presidency. He plans to continue to try to lower costs for families, defend personal freedoms, protect the right to vote, and fight against cancer. He said he also plans to continue to speak out against gun violence, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nAbroad, the president said he would continue to make NATO stronger, support Ukraine's fight for freedom, and work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden, who ran on the idea that democracy itself was at stake in 2020 and is again in 2024 with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, reminded Americans that they are the ones who will determine America's destiny: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nThe president also listed what he believes are his greatest achievements, including lowering the racial wealth gap, passing bipartisan infrastructure funding, achieving wins against big pharma, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, compensating veterans exposed to toxic materials and putting the first African American woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nDemocrats have fallen in line behind Harris, after Mr. Biden endorsed her for the nomination soon after announcing he would end his campaign. Mr. Biden cannot appoint a successor for the Democratic nomination, but since his announcement on Sunday, Harris has secured the endorsements of a majority of Democratic delegates.\n\nThe president has said little since his decision while he recovers from COVID-19 symptoms at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The White House said Tuesday that he tested negative, although it's not clear when he took the test. Mr. Biden told reporters Tuesday upon his return from Delaware that he's feeling \"well.\"\n\nOval Office addresses are rare for a president, including for Mr. Biden. Before last week, Mr. Biden had only delivered two Oval Office addresses in his three-and-a-half years as president. Last week, he delivered his third Oval Office address, following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough Mr. Biden plans to participate in the campaign, stepping down from the Democratic ticket allows him to focus on the task of the presidency itself, away from the physically taxing campaign trail.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the president told his campaign staff -- who are now Harris's campaign staff -- Monday. \"I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as -- and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, is among the most critical of not just Mr. Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.\n\n\"In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future,\" the president said from the Oval Office. \"I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me, and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "African Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_inequality_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racial inequality in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bipartisanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/25/f2bbc71c-7991-4226-b918-f90f93ec2456/thumbnail/1200x630g2/fbf35d52cf4a018168334bb40a57e497/gettyimages-2162706300.jpg?v=5501038cbc281520ff9fdc308faab7dc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thestar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service. Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nRead more: Elections Harris steps into the limelight.

Now is the time to make way for those newer, younger voices, he said, like that of Harris, whom he has endorsed for the nomination.\n\nThough he did not mention Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump by name, Mr. Biden has referred to Trump as a threat to democracy.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term,\" the president said. \"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nMr. Biden hinted that he had arrived at the decision to drop out in part because of doubts over whether he could defeat Trump.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" the president said. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\nMr. Biden took a moment to reflect and marvel at where his life had begun, long before his 51-year-long political journey.\n\n\"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton and Claymont one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" he said. \"But here I am. That's what's so special about America.\"\n\nThe president expressed his gratitude to the American people, and praised the country as a nation of possibilities.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,\" he said, adding, \"I have given my heart and my soul to so many nation, like so many others. I'm blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am, to all of you.\"\n\nFor the remaining six months of his term, Mr. Biden said he plans to focus on the job of the presidency. He plans to continue to try to lower costs for families, defend personal freedoms, protect the right to vote, and fight against cancer. He said he also plans to continue to speak out against gun violence, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nAbroad, the president said he would continue to make NATO stronger, support Ukraine's fight for freedom, and work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nAnd Mr. Biden, who ran on the idea that democracy itself was at stake in 2020 and is again in 2024 with Donald Trump as the Republican nominee, reminded Americans that they are the ones who will determine America's destiny: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nThe president also listed what he believes are his greatest achievements, including lowering the racial wealth gap, passing bipartisan infrastructure funding, achieving wins against big Pharma, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, compensating veterans exposed to toxic materials and putting the first African American woman on the Supreme Court.\n\nHundreds of White House staffers remained to watch Mr. Biden's address, and he emerged afterward from the Oval Office to greet them, to huge cheers.\n\nA Trump campaign official confirmed that the GOP nominee also watched the president's speech from his plane after a rally in Charlotte; New York Times photographer Doug Mills snapped a picture.\n\nDemocrats have fallen in line behind Harris, after Mr. Biden endorsed her for the nomination soon after announcing he would end his campaign. Mr. Biden cannot appoint a successor for the Democratic nomination, but since his announcement on Sunday, Harris has secured the endorsements of a majority of Democratic delegates.\n\nThe president has said little since his decision while he recovered from COVID-19 symptoms at his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. The White House said Tuesday that he had tested negative, and Mr. Biden told reporters upon his return from Delaware that he's feeling \"well.\"\n\nOval Office addresses are rare for a president, including for Mr. Biden. Before last week, Mr. Biden had only delivered two Oval Office addresses in his three-and-a-half years as president. Last week, he delivered his third Oval Office address, following the assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlthough Mr. Biden plans to participate in the campaign, stepping down from the Democratic ticket allows him to focus on the task of the presidency itself, away from the physically taxing campaign trail.\n\n\"I'm not going anywhere,\" the president told his campaign staff -- who are now Harris's campaign staff -- Monday. \"I'm going to be out there on the campaign with her, with Kamala. I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as -- and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, is among the most critical of not just Mr. Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.\n\n\"In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future,\" the president said from the Oval Office. \"I made my choice. I've made my views known. I would like to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me, and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The president addressed reasons for abruptly ending his run for a second term after initially rejecting calls from some top Democrats to do so, and outlined what he hopes to accomplish in his remaining months in office. (Photo by Evan Vucci-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden explained his decision not to seek reelection during a prime-time address from the Oval Office on Wednesday, saying now is the time to turn over power to the next generation.\n\n\"I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point -- one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come,\" Biden said. \"America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\"\n\nThe 11-minute speech was the first time Biden spoke at length on camera since releasing a letter Sunday withdrawing as the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee. He will continue to serve out his term.\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has received support from enough delegates to clinch the party's official nomination during a virtual roll call vote slated for early August.\n\nBiden called into a campaign rally earlier this week, but had only given off-camera or brief remarks since announcing his decision to step aside while sidelined with COVID-19.\n\nCalls for Biden to bow out began after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27 raised significant concerns among Democrats and others about his age and cognitive abilities.\n\nSpeaking directly to Americans in his address, Biden said he believed his record, leadership and vision for the country's future \"all merited a second term.\"\n\n\"But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy and that includes personal ambition,\" Biden said. \"So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden said that while there is \"a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" there is also a time for \"younger voices.\"\n\n\"And that time and place is now,\" Biden said.\n\nDuring his remaining six months in office, Biden said he planned to continue pressing for gun control, reproductive rights, voting rights and an end to all forms of violence, including political.\n\nBiden said he wanted to secure an end to the war in Gaza and bring home the hostages that Hamas took when it attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nHe said he planned to press for changes to the Supreme Court, calling it essential for democracy.\n\nBiden also recounted the numerous laws enacted since he became president as well as his efforts to hold the NATO alliance together following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHe said he hoped Americans understood how \"grateful\" he was for his decades as an elected official.\n\n\"I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and I still do, that the soul of America was at stake, the very nature of who we are was at stake,\" Biden said.\n\nHarris, he said, has the experience, strength and capability to lead the country following the November elections.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule -- the people do,\" Biden said. \"History is in your hands, the power is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep the faith and remember who we are.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/rhode_island_current_articles_444/951eb519c59941c0a794839c3d4c4cde", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1611, "textEnd": 1618}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 2625, "textEnd": 2631}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

It will also give Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden will say according to excerpts released by the White House. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden was set to say Wednesday. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address is being carried by the major television news networks. He is set to pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.\n\nMore from this section\n\n2024 Election Latest: Biden ends reelection bid, endorses VP Harris for Democratic nomination\n\niMyFone VoxBox TTS Voice AI Launches Video Dubbing Feature\n\nFederal funds fuel quarterly growth in U.S. down payment assistance programs, which now number 2,415", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "will_weissert@kulr8.com", "name": "Will Weissert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@kulr8.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "seung_min_kim@kulr8.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Union (American Civil War)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kulr8.com/content/tncms/custom/image/ebec0578-57d0-11ee-978f-b7da313020af.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 2221, "textEnd": 2228}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

And that includes personal ambition.\n\nMr Biden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his debate against Mr Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks.\n\nIt sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Mr Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nMr Biden tried to outlast the scepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with Covid-19, Mr Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed by an endorsement of Ms Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Mr Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices\".\n\nHe added: \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden pledged to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on January 20 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Mr Biden and Ms Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Mr Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Mr Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nMr Biden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.\n\nThe way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Ms Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Ms Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nMs Harris's advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nMr Biden, aides say, knows that if Ms Harris loses, he will be criticised for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Mr Trump.\n\nIf she wins, she will ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he will be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washingtonian_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washingtonian (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDdcXFwvMjUwMTM5MjJcXFwvY2U3OWUxZDAyMDY2NDUyYWI2ZWJjZTc2M2FhZWY2MjYuanBnXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEyMDAsXCJoZWlnaHRcIjo2MjcsXCJkZWZhdWx0XCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiIwMDExODc1NTY1OGM1Y2Q4YThhZjQ5MDBkN2UwZGNlMjViMDQyNTYyIn0=/biden-uses-oval-office-address-to-explain-his-decision-to-quit-2024-race.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 1949, "textEnd": 1959}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

He will continue to serve out his term.\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who has received support from enough delegates to clinch the party's official nomination during a virtual roll call vote slated for early August.\n\nBiden called into a campaign rally earlier this week, but had only given off-camera or brief remarks since announcing his decision to step aside while sidelined with COVID-19.\n\nCalls for Biden to bow out began after his performance during the first presidential debate on June 27 raised significant concerns among Democrats and others about his age and cognitive abilities.\n\nSpeaking directly to Americans in his address, Biden said he believed his record, leadership and vision for the country's future \"all merited a second term.\"\n\n\"But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy and that includes personal ambition,\" Biden said. \"So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.

It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in a short yet emotional speech delivered from the Oval Office on Wednesday.\n\n\"It's about 'We the People,'\" he said. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address to the nation marks the first time he's publicly talked about his decision to bow out of the presidential election since he first announced the plan in a letter made public on Sunday - a decision set in motion after his disastrous performance in the first presidential debate last month. Though he tried to jettison the growing calls to step aside and assuage panicked Democrats that he was still fit for the job, he ultimately couldn't overcome the pressure campaign, which by the end also included some of his oldest friends and most trusted advisers and allies.\n\nBiden announced his decision over the weekend from his beach home in Delaware, where he'd been out of the public eye and recovering from COVID-19 for four days. \"I draw strength, and I find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures.\"\n\nFor Biden, who promised Americans time and time again, \"I will tell you the truth,\" as he ascended the White House while the country was still paralyzed by the pandemic, his remarks on Wednesday brought his presidency full circle - albeit not in the way he likely expected or hoped.\n\n\"When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you and tell you the truth, and the truth is that the sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us,\" he said. \"In recent weeks it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term. But nothing - nothing - can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\n\"There's a time and place for long years of experience in public life, but there's also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices - yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nBiden's speech also sought to provide a roadmap for what lies ahead and how he'll govern for the remaining months of his term - or as he put it, how he'll \"finish the job for the American people.\"\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nHe said that he will keep speaking out against gun violence, calling for Supreme Court reform, protecting NATO, preventing Russian President Vladimir Putin from overtaking Ukraine, and ending the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden spoke only briefly about Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he endorsed as the Democratic nominee not long after he announced his exit from the race.\n\n\"She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable,\" Biden said of Harris. \"She's been an incredible partner to me.\"\n\nHarris has worked quickly since then to secure enough Democratic National Committee delegates to become the presumptive Democratic nominee and bring together the party's establishment behind her bid. In doing so, she's also managed to raise $126 million in the 72 hours since Biden stepped aside and endorsed her. In the same timespan, more than 40,000 new voters have registered - the vast majority of of whom are under the age of 34.\n\nIn her first campaign speech on Wednesday, Harris offered voters a vision for the future, focusing on the need for affordable health care, child care and paid family leave, while also stressing issues she's long championed, including gun safety and reproductive rights.\n\nBiden did not address calls from dozens of Republicans to resign or for his Cabinet officials to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Those calls have been echoed by House Speaker Mike Johnson and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, former President Donald Trump's newly anointed running mate.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said, making a not-so-veiled reference to Trump's vow that he will only be dictator for one day if reelected. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nThough he never mentioned Trump by name in his speech, he impressed upon viewers the choice they have on Election Day between preserving democracy or plunging the country into chaos.\n\n\"America is at an inflection point - one of those rare moments in history where the decisions we make now determine our fate, the fate of the nation and the world for decades to come,\" he said. \"America is going to have to choose between moving forward or moving backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parental leave"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproductive_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reproductive rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Creve Coeur-based nursing home operator files for bankruptcy Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient BenFred: Smart contract stance lets Cardinals be nimble as Goldschmidt tries to salvage season Ankle injury interrupts Tommy Edman's rehab games, delays his return: Cardinals Extra BenFred: So, you're looking to trade with the Cardinals. Who are you (realistically) targeting? MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: 0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He became a lifelong Democrat when he won his Senate seat two years later.\n\nWASHINGTON - President Joe Biden said in a primetime address to the nation on Wednesday that he ended his campaign for a second term because, even though he reveres the office of the presidency, \"I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he said from the Oval Office. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIn his first public remarks since dropping out of the presidential race on Sunday, Biden pledged during a somber 10-minute address to spend his last six months in office working to make sure the United States remains strong, secure and the leader of the free world.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" he said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden ended his campaign for a second term on Sunday after weeks of pressure from nervous Democrats and major donors, who feared he would lose to former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's withdrawal threw the presidential race into unchartered territory just four months before the election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris quickly announced that she would run for president, and Biden offered her his endorsement. Harris has since raised more than $126 million for her nascent campaign and has already secured more than enough delegates to win the party's nomination.\n\nFull-blown crisis: An inside look at Biden campaign's pitfalls.\n\nIn the letter announcing his decision to pull out of the race, Biden said while it had always been his intention to run for a second term, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nThe pressure on Biden to drop out started to build after a disastrous debate with Trump last month raised questions about his physical and mental acuity and his ability to serve another four-year term. But the White House insisted Monday, just a few hours before Biden's speech, that concerns about his health had nothing to do with his decision to exit the race.\n\n'A brave act': Americans react to President Biden's historic decision\n\nIn his remarks, Biden made it clear he plans to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\nBiden said he plans to spend the next six months doing his job as president - working to lower costs for families, growing the economy and defending personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\nHe said he would continue rallying a coalition of allies to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine and would keep working to end the war in Gaza and bring peace to the Middle East.\n\nBiden said he would also continue to pursue Supreme Court reform and his \"Moonshot\" program to end cancer.\n\nA natural successor: As President Joe Biden steps aside, is America ready for President Kamala Harris?\n\nThe United States remains a nation of \"promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers,\" he said.\n\nIn a reference to the upcoming election, Biden gave a shoutout to Harris, saying she had been an incredible partner and a leader for the country.\n\n\"She's experienced,\" he said. \"She's tough. She's capable.\"\n\nNow, he said, the future direction of the country is up to the American people.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" he said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\nCardinals' TV ratings on record-low pace amid continuing distribution problems: Media Views Tammie Holland, longtime St. Louis radio personality, dies at 53 Third bear sighting reported in southern Illinois, sheriff says New St. Louis Public Schools communications chief also lives in Texas St. Louis Public Schools halts hiring over questions on new administrator from Texas Former St. Louis Rams lineman ordered to pay $500,000 to injured worker Woman from Valley Park drowns in Big River trying to help another canoeist Kohn's Kosher Deli facing lawsuit of nearly $150,000 O'Fallon, Mo., woman charged with making politically motivated false child sex abuse claim Creve Coeur-based nursing home operator files for bankruptcy Messenger: A disturbing twist in the case of security guards who tackled BJC patient BenFred: Smart contract stance lets Cardinals be nimble as Goldschmidt tries to salvage season Ankle injury interrupts Tommy Edman's rehab games, delays his return: Cardinals Extra BenFred: So, you're looking to trade with the Cardinals. Who are you (realistically) targeting? MSD's recently retired CEO was paid more than $100,000 for unused vacation, sick time\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service. Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nRead more: 0 Comments", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seung_min_kim@stltoday.com", "name": "Seung Min Kim", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zeke_miller@stltoday.com", "name": "Zeke Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Edman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Edman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing home care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_St._Louis_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "History of the St. Louis Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Public_Schools", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Public Schools"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smart contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_rehabilitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drug rehabilitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Fallon,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "O'Fallon, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "O'Fallon, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nIt is rare for an American president to relinquish power voluntarily, without the force of rejection by the electorate or the limits of the Constitution. Biden, who acceded to heavy pressure from within his own party to step aside as a candidate, cast his choice as one made in the interest of the nation and called on Americans to join him to \"preserve our democracy.\"\n\nHe and other Democrats consistently argue that former President Donald Trump, whose refusal to concede after he lost the 2020 election to Biden culminated in a mob attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in an effort to stop the certification, is a threat to democracy.\n\nFollow live updates on Biden's speech here\n\n\"America's going to have to choose between moving forward or backward,\" Biden said, without directly mentioning Trump. \"Between hope and hate. Between unity and division.\"\n\nHe added, \"Our republic is now in your hands.\"\n\nThe speech, which came three days after he dropped his bid, is the beginning of Biden's efforts to shape his legacy following a disastrous debate performance in late June that left members of his own party calling for him to step off the campaign trail and allow another candidate to run against Trump. Many Democrats believed Biden's bumbling debate performance and halting push to clean it up made his path to re-election impossible.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said in remarks delivered in a low tone and, at times, in a halting fashion. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nAt a campaign rally in North Carolina on Wednesday night, Trump went after his former opponent. \"Three days ago, we officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country, crooked Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\nBiden abandoned his re-election campaign early Sunday afternoon, announcing the decision in a post on X that he followed about half an hour later with an endorsement of his vice president, Kamala Harris, for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nShe quickly consolidated support from within their party and is expected to win a virtual roll call of Democratic delegates -- perhaps without opposition -- as early as Aug. 1 and no later than Aug. 7.\n\nBiden offered praise for Harris Wednesday night.\"She's experienced, she's tough , she's capable,\" Biden said. \"She's been an incredible partner to me and leader for our country.\"\n\nIn leaving the nomination to her, Biden became the first eligible incumbent to cede his party's presidential nod since Lyndon Johnson in 1968. That was two years before Biden first ran for office in Delaware, a New Castle County Council seat that he won.\n\nTwo years later, at age 29, he defeated Republican Sen. Caleb Boggs in a tightly contested campaign. Biden would win six more terms in the Senate -- where he was chairman of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees at different times -- with the last victory coming the same year, 2008, he was elected vice president. Along with President Barack Obama, Biden won re-election as vice president in 2012. He came out of retirement to defeat a crowded field of rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and ultimately beat Trump that November.\n\nHis decision to retire rather than remain on the 2024 ballot means he will finish his career undefeated in general elections -- though he ran and lost in presidential primaries in 1988 and 2008. It also brings to an end a career focused on the presidency. Biden first contemplated running for the Oval Office in the first election in which he was old enough -- 1980 -- and at least considered bids in most of the years when no Democratic incumbent was on the ballot.\n\nOnce regarded as a centrist within his party, Biden won support from progressives in Congress early on in his administration. He and his Democratic allies credit him with enacting the most sweeping domestic agenda since the Johnson administration -- a claim that is hard to measure and with which critics take issue.\n\nNo matter the metric, Biden signed into law major measures with profound effects on the country, including a nearly $2 trillion Covid-relief measure, a trillion-dollar infrastructure package and a bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act that included significant provisions aimed at controlling climate change.\n\nIn addition to putting Harris -- the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American person to be vice president -- on his ticket, he appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nBiden said Wednesday night that his record \"merited a second term.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden pledged to pursue his agenda until a new president is sworn in Jan. 20.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights -- from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nHe also nodded to what he sees as the danger of a second Trump presidency in an implicit call for Americans to reject his longtime rival.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" he said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Later in the day, a 15-year-old was arrested for assaulting a police officer in front of Union Station.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags, lit one ablaze and hoisted Palestinian flags in their place to massive cheers in the crowd.\n\nThree men were also arrested for assaulting a police officer and crossing a police line in Columbus Circle, outside Union Station, police said.\n\nBiden says he put party unity over a 'merited' second term\n\nDefending his tenure, Biden said his \"record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term.\" But, he said, \"I needed to unite my party.\"\n\nContrasting himself with Trump, he added, \"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families.

Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy che\n\nmical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's sp\n\neech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib h\n\nolds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ah\n\nead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not play\n\ning around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily members\n\nof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000\n\nprotestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke to\n\na roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com",

And that includes personal ambition.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nMr Biden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his debate against Mr Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks.\n\nIt sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Mr Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nMr Biden tried to outlast the scepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with Covid-19, Mr Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed by an endorsement of Ms Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Mr Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices\".\n\nHe added: \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden pledged to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on January 20 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Mr Biden and Ms Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Mr Trump by name.\n\nMr Biden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.\n\nThe way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Ms Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Ms Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nMs Harris's advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nMr Biden, aides say, knows that if Ms Harris loses, he will be criticised for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Mr Trump.\n\nIf she wins, she will ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he will be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

His tone was wistful, and his speech was an early farewell.\n\n\"It's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,\" he said\n\nSitting behind the Resolute Desk and surrounded by photos of his family, Biden ticked through the accomplishments of his term, ranging from the choice of the first Black woman to be a Supreme Court justice to pulling the country out of a paralyzing pandemic. He expressed gratitude to the American people for allowing a \"kid with a stutter\" from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to reach the pinnacle of American politics.\n\nJust beyond the camera, dozens of aides and several members of his family, including Jill Biden, the first lady, watched as Joe Biden said he would walk away from the office they had worked to help him reach for decades.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" he said, \"but I love my country more.\"\n\nUltimately, Biden said, he concluded that \"the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\" The president praised Vice President Kamala Harris -- \"she's experienced; she's tough; she's capable\" -- but warned, as he has for years, that Americans faced a choice between preserving democracy and allowing it to backslide.\n\n\"History is in your hands,\" Biden said. \"The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep faith, keep the faith, and remember who we are.\"\n\nBiden, who spent the first part of the week recovering from COVID at his beach house in Delaware, spoke with a rasp and slight slur in his voice, speaking sometimes haltingly as he promised that he would defend his legacy and do what he could to help Harris win the election against former President Donald Trump. He stared straight ahead into the camera and seldom blinked.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" Biden said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hardworking families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nThis speech was the fourth Oval Office address of Biden's presidency and the second just this month. Ten days ago, Biden urged Americans to lower the political temperature after a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, wounding the former president and killing one of his supporters.\n\nOther than saying it was time to pass the torch to someone young, Biden offered no other reason for his decision to step down. He did not mention the three-week pressure campaign from his own party to get him out of the race after his faltering and at times incoherent debate performance with Trump on June 27.\n\nBiden and his advisers, aides said, still believed that he had a path to victory but that he had been unable to flip the focus from his debate showing back onto the policies espoused by Trump. His decision to turn the race over to Harris ultimately overrode some of his private concerns about her ability to be able to win in a general election.\n\nThe drafting of his Wednesday address began Sunday after Biden made the decision to drop out. Mike Donilon, one of the president's senior aides, helped Biden fashion the remarks. Jon Meacham, the presidential historian, contributed to the speech, as well as Vinay Reddy, a White House speechwriter.\n\nBiden now has six months to bolster a legacy that he is proud of but that gained little traction among Democratic voters, who had long registered their concerns in polls about his age and ability to do the job. Over the last 3 1/2 years, Biden worked to repair frayed relations with American allies in the West, passed a raft of landmark legislation and helped lead the country out of a crippling pandemic.\n\nBut Biden, a former senator who spent 36 years priding himself in his ability to find compromise on legislation, now has little hope to deliver on unfulfilled promises he has made on issues ranging from women's rights to voting protections.\n\nIn recent days, Harris has blazed onto the campaign trail, surfing a wave of hope and enthusiasm from Democratic voters that was absent during much of Biden's presidency. Though Biden has promised to campaign vigorously for the vice president, his schedule for next week remains relatively clear, beyond a trip to Austin, Texas, on Monday to speak at the presidential library of President Lyndon Johnson -- the last Democratic president who decided not to seek re-election.\n\nBiden is also facing heightened pressure from Republicans -- including Trump's new running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio -- who argue that he must resign if he does not think he would be able to serve a second term.\n\nIn a press briefing Wednesday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said that Biden would not resign and, in fact, still believes that he would be able to fulfill his duties four years into a second term.\n\nHe did not say any of that in the Oval Office. Instead, he said repeatedly that he had put the good of the country before his political aspirations.\n\n\"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nAfter Biden delivered his remarks, he stepped into the Rose Garden, where dozens of cheering White House officials awaited.", "source": {"uri": "spokesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spokesman Review"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden was set to say Wednesday. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address is being carried by the major television news networks.

He has endorsed Kamala Harris, his vice-president, for the Democratic nomination ahead of this year's presidential election.\n\nMr Biden said: \"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term.\n\n\"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\n\"So I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation as the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden had faced weeks of criticism from senior members of his own party, who argued his age and health would prevent him from beating Donald Trump for a second time in November.\n\nHe was resistant to calls from some of his closest allies, including Nancy Pelosi, for him to step down, before he posted a letter on X, formerly Twitter, announcing he was suspending his campaign. He then endorsed Ms Harris to replace him.\n\n\"The defence of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people,\" he said on Wednesday night.\n\n\"But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nSurrounded by his family in the Oval Office, Mr Biden quoted both the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence during his short address. He did not take any questions.\n\nHe also laid out a series of his achievements in office, including his flagship \"Bidenomics\" policies, crime reduction and his appointment of the first Black woman as a justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Biden did not refer specifically to Trump, who eroded his lead in swing states before his decision to stand down, but stressed that he had decided to quit the race because of threats to American democracy. He has previously referred to Trump as a \"dictator\".\n\n\"We're all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,\" he said.\n\n\"We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either.\n\n\"And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now. In just a few months, the American people choose the course of America's future.\"\n\nMr Biden ended his remarks by thanking the public for giving \"a kid with a stutter\" the opportunity to serve as president.\n\nHe said: \"Here I am. That's what's so special about America. We're a nation of promise and possibilities of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.\"\n\nFollowing his address, his family members shed tears as Mr Biden embraced them.\n\nMr Biden's address came after Ms Harris's second speech since she became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party earlier on Wednesday.\n\nShe has received the support of enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention to be awarded the nomination. The vast majority of delegates were previously allocated to Mr Biden after the party's primary race earlier this year.\n\nMr Biden promised to continue his work as president until January, when he will be replaced by the winner of this year's election. Some Republicans have called for him to stand down immediately.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. \"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hardworking families, [to] grow our economy.\n\n\"I'll keep defending our personal freedoms in our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\n\"I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, [and] make it clear there is no place in America for political violence, or any violence, ever.\"\n\nThanks for following the Telegraph's live blog. We'll be back on Thursday with the latest updates on the US election.\n\nMr Biden said: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nAfterwards, Mr Biden embraced his teary-eyed family members, who watched the address from the Oval Office in a show of support.\n\nMr Biden praised Kamala Harris for being \"experienced, tough and capable,\" and said that when voters cast their ballots in November they should remember the words of Benjamin Franklin that America is a \"Republic, if you can keep it\".\n\nHe added: \"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this country for 50 years of my life.\"\n\nMr Biden said: \"I ran for president four years ago because I believe the soul of America is at stake ... and that's still the case.\"\n\nMr Biden said: \"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as President. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote - to the right to choose.\"\n\nHe also said he would focus on ending gun violence, developments in cancer research, and ending US involvement in wars around the globe.\n\nMr Biden said that \"nothing, nothing\" could stand in the way of \"saving our democracy, adding: \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden said America was at a crossroads and \"has to choose\" between \"hope and hate\".\n\nJoe Biden has begun his address to the American people from the Oval Office.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the US president said: \"The defence of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nThe acting director of the US Secret Service will testify before three Senate committees on Thursday in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the committees announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation will also testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is holding a hearing in partnership with the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the US Secret Service on Tuesday after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination. Ronald L Rowe Jr. replaced her as acting director.\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic Party bosses were behind Mr Biden's decision to step down and accused Ms Harris of covering up the US president's \"mental unfitness.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the White House denied it had covered up any possible decline in Biden's health prior to his decision to drop out of the election race.\n\nTrump called Ms Harris \"the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.\"\n\nHe claimed that she wanted \"abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy\" as well as \"right up until birth and even after birth, the execution of a baby.\"\n\nDonald Trump claimed Kamala Harris was in favor of the \"execution\" of babies due to her stance on abortions, adding: \"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country.\"\n\n\"We're not going to let that happen,\" he told the crowd in North Carolina.\n\nDonald Trump unleashed a series of attacks on Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since Joe Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nAppearing in Charlotte, North Carolina, a battleground state that carries 16 electoral college votes, Mr Trump dubbed the Vice President \"Lyin' Kamala\", a description he first levelled at Republican Senator Ted Cruz during the 2016 GOP primary.\n\nReports suggest the Trump campaign has been scrambling on how to respond since Mr Biden announced at the weekend he was dropping out of the race. Polls suggest the 59-year-old Ms Harris could be more competitive in several states than Mr Biden, not because she is 20 year younger than Trump.\n\n\"Lyin' Kamala is most left wing politician in the country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"She's absolutely terrible. She's, as you know, more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Can you believe it? She's rated far more liberal than Bernie. She's now trying to get rid of her record, but you can't.\"\n\nMs Harris has previously hit back at Trump, referencing her time at Attorney General of California and suggesting she had dealt with people like the former president, who earlier this year became the US president convicted of a crime.\n\nThe former president's trip to North Carolina suggested he is still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nThe last Democrat to win North Carolina was Barack Obama in 2008. But Ms Harris's supporters believe the state could be in play, especially if she picks Governor Roy Cooper as her running mate.\n\nDonald Trump said \"lyin' Kamala\" is the most left wing politician in America, more so than Bernie Sanders.\n\nDonald Trump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nDonald Trump accused Kamala Harris of being a \"radical left lunatic\" Wednesday, in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee in the White House race.\n\n\"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\" the former president and Republican nominee claimed, calling her \"the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.\"\n\nJoe Biden said on X he would discuss \"what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people\" in his televised speech Wednesday night.\n\nThe US president returned to the White House on Tuesday after spending nearly a week with Covid at his Delaware beach home, a period of isolation in which he took the decision to step back from the presidential race.\n\nRepublicans have called for Mr Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.\n\nA White House spokesman dismissed that as \"ridiculous\" and maintained that Mr Biden is no \"lame duck.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden stunned the world when he announced Sunday that he would not seek reelection, bowing to weeks of pressure after a disastrous, stumbling debate performance against Trump last month.\n\nThe veteran Democrat will tonight deliver his first speech since bowing out of the presidential race, using the powerfully symbolic setting of the Oval Office to try to restore some dignity as the clock ticks on his presidency and a half-century in public service.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, told reporters Wednesday that Mr Biden's decision has \"nothing to do with his health.\"\n\nShe denied that the White House had covered up any possible decline in Biden's condition. \"It is not a cover up. I know that is the narrative that you all want. It is not,\" she said.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu told US lawmakers on Wednesday that Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza and that after the war with Hamas the enclave should be led by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy his country.\n\nSpeaking to a joint meeting of Congress, the Israeli prime minister said that for the foreseeable future, however, Israel would need overriding security control of Gaza.\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the Donald Trump speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nJamie Raskin, a Democrat representative from Maryland, said Benjamin Netanyahu's speech was made for Donald Trump's GOP.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral ceasefire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\n\nHamas has responded to Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in the US congress calling for a new alliance in the Middle East by labelling Muslims who join it \"treasonous\".\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, told Reuters on Wednesday that an alliance with Mr Netanyahu from any party is a \"treason to the blood of martyrs\".\n\nIn his speech addressing the US Congress earlier on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said the US and Israel can forge a security alliance in the Middle East to counter an Iranian \"threat\", saying that all countries which will make peace with Israel should join such an alliance.\n\nAt Union Station, protesters have removed American flags from the building and set them alight, while burning an effigy of Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSome protesters climbed a flag pole and chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged a person away.\n\nAt least two people were seen being treated for the effect of chemical agents to the eyes.\n\nThousands of people protesting Israel's war in Gaza are marching in Washington chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as they filled blocks of city streets.\n\nPolice used pepper spray on demonstrators while Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress.\n\nDemonstrators calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians marched toward the Capitol but were blocked by police from getting closer to the building.\n\nDemonstrators rallied near the Capitol before marching toward the building ahead of Mr Netanyahu's address to the joint session of Congress.\n\nAfter blocking a nearby intersection, protesters chanted, \"Shut it down!\" as they marched behind a banner that said \"globalize the student intifada.\"\n\n\"Bibi, Bibi, We're not done! The intifada has just begun!\" they shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Other protesters chanted, \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide.\"\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu told Congress he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Mr Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister called Wednesday for a demilitarized and deradicalized post-war Gaza, laying out his vision for the narrow coastal territory devastated by nine months of war.\n\n\"Following our victory, with the help of regional partners, the demilitarization and deradicalization of Gaza can also lead to a future of security, prosperity and peace. That's my vision for Gaza,\" Mr Netanyahu told US lawmakers.\n\nMr Netanyahu called on the US to fast-track military aid to his country to help end the war in Gaza, after previously accusing Washington of holding up assistance.\n\n\"I deeply appreciate America's support, including in this current war. But this is an exceptional moment. Fast-tracking US military aid could dramatically expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader war in the Middle East,\" Mr Netanyahu told the US Congress.\n\nThe Israeli leader said accusations that Israel was causing a famine in Gaza were akin to an anti-Semitic \"blood libel\".\n\n\"Don't be fooled when the blood libels against the Jewish state come from people who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu cited the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court accusing Israel of deliberately starving Gazans as a \"case in point\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said this was a \"complete fabrication\" and that Israel had \"enabled\" 40,000 aid trucks, or half a million tonnes of food, to enter into Gaza since the war began.\n\n\"That's more than 3,000 calories for every man, woman and child in Gaza. If there are Palestinians in Gaza who are not getting enough food, it's not because Israel are blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said: \"The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimise Israel, to demonise the Jewish state and to demonise Jews everywhere.\n\n\"And no wonder we've witnessed an appalling rise in anti-Semitism in America and around the world. My friends, whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti-Semitism we must unequivocally condemn it and resolutely fight it, without exceptions.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu added: \"We (Jews) were accused of everything from poisoning wells, spreading plagues, to using the blood of children to bake Passover matzahs (bread). These preposterous anti-Semitic lies led to persecution, mass murder and ultimately, to history's worst genocide: the Holocaust.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu took aim at the equivocations of university leaders in the face of antisemitism on American college campuses.\n\nHe said: \"80 years after the Holocaust, the presidents of Harvard, Penn and I'm ashamed to say, my alma mater, MIT, couldn't bring themselves to condemn the calls for the genocide of Jews...they said it depends on the context.\n\n\"Well let me give these befuddled academics some context: Antisemitism is the world's oldest hatred. For centuries the massacre of Jews was always preceded by wild accusations.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu added: \"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza. They might as well hold up signs saying chickens for KFC.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said US anti-Israel protestors were \"Iran's useful idiots\".\n\nHe said: \"For all we know Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests outside this building...Well I have a message for these protestors: when the tyrants of Tehran who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nThe Israeli prime minister said: \"These protestors burn American flags even on the fourth of July. I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina who protected the American flag against these anti-Israel protestors.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said: \"They (protestors) refuse to make the simple distinction between those who target terrorists and those who target civilians; between the democratic state of Israel and the terrorist thugs of Hamas.\n\n\"We recently learned from the US director of national intelligence that Iran is funding and promoting anti-Israel protests in America. They (Iran) want to disrupt America.\"\n\nHe said anti-Israel \"protestors should be ashamed of themselves\" for \"standing with\" Hamas. Many US lawmakers in the gallery stood up and cheered his remarks.\n\nMr Netanyahu said the lessons of the Holocaust must be heeded and that for Israel, \"never again must never be an empty promise\".\n\nMr Netanyahu heaped praise on the bravery of the Israeli army, calling them the \"lions of Judah\".\n\n\"These, ladies and gentlemen, are the soldiers of Israel: unbowed, undaunted, unafraid...they have risen like lions\", he said.\n\n\"The lions of Judah, the lions of Israel...the men and women of the IDF come from every corner of Israeli society, every colour, every creed...all are imbued with the spirit of the Maccabees (ancient Jewish warriors).\"\n\nHe added: \"Because of them, the Jewish people are no longer helpless in the face of our enemies.\"\n\nIsrael, the United States and the Arab world are under threat from Iran's \"axis of terror,\" Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers in a landmark speech before the US Congress on Wednesday.\n\n\"Our world is in upheaval. In the Middle East, Iran's axis of terror confronts America, Israel and our Arab friends. This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization,\" Mr Netanyahu said.\n\nMr Netanyahu highlighted the bravery of one of the first responders on October 7 who was in attendance at his speech.\n\n\"He ran eight miles to the front lines of Gaza to defend his people,\" Mr Netanyahu said. \"He ran eight miles, came to the front lines, killed many terrorists, and saved many, many lives...we all honour his remarkable heroism.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said President Biden had told him he was a \"proud Irish American Zionist\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said further efforts were underway to free more hostages and thanked President Joe Biden for his efforts to help to secure their release.\n\nHe also lauded Mr Biden for calling Hamas \"sheer evil\" in the wake of the October 7 attack.\n\nThe Israeli leader said \"many hostage families\" had accompanied him to the Congress on Wednesday.\n\nDiscussing one family, he said \"two beautiful red haired children were taken hostage, what monsters\".\n\nHe added: \"The pain these families have endured is beyond words.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said that, as a proportion of the population sizes of the US and Israel, the October 7 Hamas massacre in Israel was comparable to \"20 9/11s in one day\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said America and Israel \"must stand together\", adding: \"I want to assure you today that we will win.\"\n\nAddressing the packed-out stands, Mr Netanyahu said: \"I want to thank you for giving me the profound honour of addressing this great citadel of democracy for the fourth time. We meet today at a crossroads of history.\"\n\nHe said the war in Israel was not a \"clash of civillisations\" but a clash \"between barbarism and civilisation\".\n\nThe Israeli leader waved at congressmen and thanked his hosts for inviting him to speak, with his opening remarks delayed by claps and cheers.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has entered the US congress to cheers and rounds of applause, with some US lawmakers reaching out to shake his hand.\n\nDemonstrators rallied near the Capitol before marching toward the building ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the joint session of Congress.\n\nAfter blocking a nearby intersection, protesters chanted, \"Shut it down!\" as they marched behind a banner that said \"globalize the student intifada.\"\n\n\"Bibi, Bibi, We're not done! The intifada has just begun!\" they shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Other protesters chanted, \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide.\"\n\nAmong the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns. They said the sculpture took months to construct and is meant to represent Joe Biden's unwillingness to stand up to Israel.\n\nPolice are dousing protesters outside the US Capitol building with pepper spray, after pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrators clashed ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's speech.\n\nHundreds of activists, the majority of whom oppose Mr Netanyahu, have launched a protest against the Israeli prime minister's speech.\n\nMr Netanyahu is due to speak shortly from the Senate chamber. Dozens of congressmen have boycotted the speech in protest of Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\nElon Musk has said he will attend Benjamin Netanyahu's address in the US Capitol on Wednesday as a guest of the Israeli prime minister, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing a spokesperson for Mike Johnson, the House speaker.\n\nSince at least her time as attorney general of California, Kamala Harris has been pro-abortion and has championed women's rights to access reproductive health care.\n\nIn her first stops on the campaign trail since Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Ms Harris pushed for legislation that would safeguard abortion rights.\n\n\"We will fight for reproductive freedom knowing if Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single state,\" she told supporters and staff in Delaware this week.\n\nOn the other hand, Donald Trump has taken credit for his three US Supreme Court appointments that preceded the court's June 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nBut on the campaign trail, he has appeared wary of the political blowback his party has taken on the issue over the last two years.\n\nPolls show that a large majority of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMs Harris said: \"When Donald Trump was president he handpicked three members of the Supreme Court because he intended for them to overturn Roe v Wade...and as intended they did.\n\n\"Well let me tell you something, when I am president of the United States, and when congress passes a law to restore those freedoms, I will sign it into law.\"\n\nAfter enumerating the legislation she plans to pass while in office on America's most fraught political issues, including voting rights, gun control and abortion, Ms Harris concluded: \"We are not playing around\".\n\nMs Harris vowed to expand voting rights and enact stricter gun control laws.\n\nShe said: \"In the face of these attacks we must continue to stand together in defence of freedom. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will make sure that every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted.\n\n\"We who believe that every person in our nation should be free from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban.\"\n\nMs Harris said: \"Ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom.\"\n\n\"Across our nation we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live without freedom from biggotry and hate...the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history and the freedom for a women to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.\"\n\nMs Harris added: \"Let's be clear, this represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future. These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back. We are not going back.\"\n\nMs Harris said: \"You may have seen (Trump's) agenda: project 2025. Can you believe they put that in writing? It is a plan to return America to a dark past.\n\n\"They intend to cut Medicare. To repeal our 35 dollar cap on insulin. To eliminate the department of education. To end programmes like Head Start, which would take away free school for hundreds of thousands of children in our communities.\"\n\nWarming to her theme, Ms Harris said she believes in a future of social justice for working class Americans.\n\n\"In this moment, I believe we face a choice of two diff visions for our nation,\" Ms Harris said. \"One focused on the future, one focused on the past.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am fighting for this nation's future... we here believe in a future where everyone has affordable healthcare...We believe in a future where the economy works for working people, that's why we forgave student debt for five million Americans...And we are finally making it so that medical debt can no longer be used against a credit score.\"\n\nMs Harris added: \"I deeply believe in the promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity and justice. Not for some but for all.\"\n\nKamala Harris told a crowd in Indianapolis that she envisions a future for America where \"everybody has opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead\".\n\n\"A future of social justice, health justice, economic justice,\" she added.\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against launching personal attacks against Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, Richard Hudson, National Republican Congressional committee chairman, urged lawmakers to stick to criticising Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" Mike Johnson, the House speaker, told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX, is attending this afternoon's speech by Benjamin Netanyahu to both houses of Congress.\n\nVoters in Indiana have not backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Kamala Harris visited the solidly Republican state on Wednesday and will speak to a constituency she hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers in November: \"women of color\".\n\nJust three days after launching her bid for the White House following President Joe Biden's departure from the race, Ms Harris will address the biennial gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Ms Harris, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nIn a memo released on Wednesday, Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris campaign chair, pointed to support among female, nonwhite and younger voters as critical to success.\n\nDonald Trump's would-be assassin flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage, the FBI Director told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nChristopher Wray revealed that at \"around 4pm\", sniper Thomas Matthew Crooks \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the packed campaign rally in Butler, Pennslyvania, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Mr Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone.\n\nIt has been reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nHours before Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the US Congress, a former member of his war cabinet has accused him of delaying progress on a Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal.\n\nBenny Gantz, leader of the National Unity party, told Mr Netanyahu to \"put your money where your mouth is\" on a hostage deal, accusing the prime minister of delaying an announcement for political reasons.\n\n\"The outline for the return of the hostages that we drew up has already been accepted -- the fact that they are waiting for the Knesset break to promote it is proof that political considerations have penetrated the holy of holies of Israel's security,\" Mr Gantz said.\n\nThat outline, first drawn up in May, \"should be implemented in a short period of time,\" he said.\n\n\"The hostages do not have another day, and there is not another minute. Since the previous outline, we have lost a quarter of the hostages alive,\" he added.\n\nMr Gantz resigned from the war cabinet in June, in a sign of spiraling divisions over Mr Netanyahu's post-conflict plans for Gaza.\n\nRepublican leadership has told its members to stop making comments about the race of Kamala Harris and instead focus on her record.\n\nThe chair of the House Republican campaign arm, Richard Hudson, issued the warning during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday after several lawmakers branded the vice-president a \"DEI\" pick, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nRepresentative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told CNN on Monday that President Biden selected Ms Harris as his running mate solely because she is black.\n\n\"One hundred percent she is a DEI hire,\" he said. \"Her record is abysmal at best.\"\n\nGlenn Grothman, Representative for Wisconsin, similarly questioned if Democrats are only backing her \"because of her ethnic background.\"\n\nTheir comments, among others, are said to have angered their colleagues.\n\n\"This should not be about personalities. It should be about policy. And we have a record to compare,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting on Tuesday.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will boycott Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress on Wednesday\n\nMs Pelosi's spokesperson, Ian Krager, said she will instead join a \"members' meeting with Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7th Hamas terror attack and kidnappings.\"\n\nThe snub is the latest in a growing tide of prominent Democrats, including vice-president Kamala Harris, and two Republicans who will skip the speech amid Israel's ruthless military campaign in the Gaza Strip.\n\nRoughly 200 people were arrested on Tuesday during a pro-Palestinian protest in a congressional building the day before Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress.\n\nThe demonstration, which took place in the Cannon House Office Building, was organized by Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nCapitol police said they warned protesters, who were chanting pro-Palestinian slogans, that their inside demonstration was \"unlawful\".\n\nJoe Biden will meet with Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday at the Oval Office before they gather with the families of Americans held hostage by Hamas, the president's office said.\n\nIsrael's prime minister will meet separately with Kamala Harris, it added.\n\nKamala Harris will head to the solidly Republican state of Indiana on Wednesday as Donald Trump holds his first public campaign rally since Biden's exit from the 2024 race.\n\nThe vice-president will address the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis and deliver one of her first addresses as the presumptive Democratic nomination to women who represent the base she sees as critical to her success.\n\nMeanwhile, her Republican opponent will divide attention as he visits Charlotte, North Carolina to deliver a speech that will set the tone of his new campaign against Ms Harris.\n\nGraphic new bodycam footage shows the lifeless body of Donald Trump's would-be assassin moments after he was shot by secret agents.\n\nThe video shows local law enforcement and a Secret Service agent surrounding the corpse of the sniper, moments after he fired a volley of shots at former President Trump at a packed campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDonald Trump has featured on professional golfer's Bryson DeChambeau's Break 50 YouTube for a \"special\" charity episode.\n\nThe American, who won his second US Open at Pinehurst last month, said that the video was made to raise funds for the veterans charity, the Wounded Warrior Project.\n\nMr DeChambeau played down speculation that this was a political stunt to aid Trump's presidential campaign, adding: \"To be clear, this is about golf and giving back to our nation's veterans, not politics.\"\n\nHe added that the show was filmed during the first week of July before the attempt on Trump's life at a rally on July 13.\n\nDonald Trump has said he is committed to debating Kamala Harris and would be \"willing\" to square up with her more than once.\n\nThe next debate is scheduled for September 10 and is set to be hosted by ABC News. Trump has been arguing in recent days for a more conservative broadcaster like Fox News to hold it, calling ABC a \"joke\".\n\nDuring a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said he \"would be willing to do more than one debate actually\".\n\nHillary Clinton has boosted her support for Kamala Harris as she penned an op-ed that said the vice-president's campaign is likely to become an \"unstoppable wave\" that wipes out Donald Trump as a rival.\n\nThe former first lady and secretary of state also spoke of the \"ugly prejudice\" Ms Harris will - and already is - facing as a woman running for president in the New York Times column.\n\nThe Harris campaign has released a four-page memo outlining how she will win the presidential election in 100 days.\n\nThe document said she could make greater voter gains than Joe Biden achieved in 2020, particularly among undecided minority and young voters, and talked up her edge over the issue of reproductive rights.\n\n\"This campaign will be close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength - and she's going to win,\" wrote Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden-Harris campaign chair.\n\nThe memo said Ms Harris will be focused on the \"blue wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as the Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, where support for Mr Biden was waning.\n\n\"We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,\" Ms O'Malley Dillon added.\n\nDonald Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call last week: \"We've got to get this war over. ... You're facing a war machine.\"\n\nIt was the first time the pair, who have a complicated history, have spoken since the former president left the White House. Trump called it a \"very good phone call\".\n\nThe Republican candidate revealed his comments to the Ukrainian leader in a Fox News interview that aired on Tuesday night, without answering whether he would curb funding to Kyiv.\n\nOlaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, said he believed it was \"very possible\" Kamala Harris would win the US election later this year, but stopped short of endorsing the vice-president over Donald Trump.\n\nMr Scholz had been unusually direct in his endorsement of President Joe Biden before the latter dropped his re-election bid last weekend and endorsed Ms Harris.\n\n\"The election campaign in the USA will certainly be exciting, now with a slightly new line-up and a new constellation,\" Mr Scholz told an annual summer news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it is very possible that Kamala Harris will win the election, but the American voters will decide.\"\n\nDon Beyer, a representative for Virginia, has trolled the Republican party following the news that their leadership told members to stop their 'diversity hire' criticism aimed at Kamala Harris.\n\nIn response to the Politico headline: 'House GOP leaders urge members: Stop making race comments about Harris', the congressman wrote: \"Good luck with that\".\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing for a cease-fire deal and return of hostages.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, will make an address to Congress later today in the hopes of bolstering waning US support for continuing Israel's fight against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Mr Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges.\n\nA permit application estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\nElizabeth Warren, senator for Massachusetts, has been fiercely defending Kamala Harris in her campaign for president, accusing the Republicans of throwing \"everything they can\" at her.\n\nWhen asked about the 'diversity hire' criticism Ms Harris has recieved, Ms Warren said: \"Here's the scariest part to the Republicans, she can win on November 5. They're gonna say everything they can, but the reality is that's what the American people are going to see.\"\n\nDonald Trump's campaign has filed a challenge to block Kamala Harris from transferring $91 million (\u00a370 million) of campaign funds from what used to be the joint Biden-Harris war chest.\n\nIn a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission, Trump's legal team accused the vice-president of \"committing the largest campaign finance violation in American history\" by fraudulently grabbing another candidate's funds to launch her own presidential campaign.\n\nAfter President Biden abandoned his re-election bid on Sunday and endorsed Ms Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket, he began the process of transferring millions of dollars to her.\n\nThe Trump campaign argued that Ms Harris is \"seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden's leftover campaign cash\" and branded it a \"brazen money grab\".\n\nMs Harris' representatives called the legal challenge \"baseless\", arguing that the campaign had Biden-Harris on it from the beginning so the funds could be used by either name on the ticket.\n\nKamala Harris' campaign has announced that since Tuesday evening it has raised $126 million (\u00a398 million) since Joe Biden bowed out of the race and officially endorsed her.\n\nThe $126 million includes $81 million donated in just the first 24 hours - largest one-day fundraising haul for any candidate ever, according to the campaign.\n\nThe contributions have come from 1.4 million donors, 64 per cent of which were making their first donations of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nKamala Harris positioned herself as the champion of middle class America and accused Donald Trump of wanting to take the country backwards in her first campaign rally on Tuesday night in Wisconsin.\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead, a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every worker has the freedom to join a union,\" she said in front of cheering crowds.\n\nShe added: \"But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. Him and his extreme 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. We know we got to take that seriously...\n\n\"Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It's 900 pages.\"\n\nKamala Harris has reportedly narrowed down her choice of running mate to two candidates, Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nBoth men have become frontrunners as the vice-president begins the vetting process to prepare for her probable nomination, according to ABC News, citing sources.\n\nMs Harris is said to have phoned Mr Shapiro on Sunday after she launched her presidential campaign. \"We spoke only about beating Donald Trump,\" the governor said on Monday.\n\nA Republican state senator has called for \"civil war\" if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November.\n\nGeorge Lang, an Ohio politician, made the comment as he introduced JD Vance at his first solo campaign event since becoming Trump's running mate on Monday night.\n\nAfter taking to the stage fist-raised and shouting Trump's post-shooting battle cry \"Fight! Fight!\", Mr Lang warned of an existential threat facing Americans. He declared in front of a large, heated crowd in Ohio: \"We are in the fight for the soul of our nation... for our kids, for our grandkids, it is a fight we can never imagine.\n\n\"I believe wholeheartedly, Donald Trump and Butler County's JD Vance are the last chance to save our country. Politically, I'm afraid if we lose this one, it's going to take a civil war to save the country.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will give what could be his final Oval Office speech at 8pm ET (1am BST) to explain why he dropped out of November's election and deny that he will spend six months as a lame duck.\n\nWith the world's eyes already on a looming clash between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Mr Biden will insist in his address to the nation that he still has work to do despite his historic decision to bow out.\n\nThe 81-year-old Democrat said on X he would discuss \"what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people\" in the primetime televised event.\n\nThe speech, expected to last eight to ten minutes, will be Mr Biden's first since stepping aside from the race on Sunday after weeks of pressure following a disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nIt comes just over a week since his last Oval Office address following an assassination attempt against Trump on July 13, but is only the fourth of his presidency overall - and could well be his last.\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" the presumptive Democratic nominee said. \"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.\"\n\nMs Harris accused Trump of trying to \"take the country backward\", and asked: \"Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?\"\n\nMs Harris enumerated Trump's former scandals, involving fraud and sexual assault, saying she would \"proudly\" put her record in public office against Trump's any day of the week. \"I know Trump's type.\"\n\nThe vice-president arrived in Milwaukee for her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with President Biden's endorsement and shored up support from Democrat heavyweights and $100 million in new donations.\n\nBy stopping in Wisconsin, Harris was putting down a marker in one of the \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that Democrats see as essential for securing a presidential victory.\n\nThe Secret Service has encouraged Donald Trump to stop organising large outdoor rallies and other outdoor events after the attempted assassination on the former president at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, agency officials urged Trump's campaign to move the events inside, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post.\n\nThe Republican candidate's team is said to be scouting new venues, including basketball arenas, and has no current plans to stage a large outdoor event, a Trump aide said.\n\nDonald Trump has said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, will visit him at his Florida estate on Friday.\n\nTrump made the announcement in a post on his social media network on Tuesday, saying: \"My PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH Agenda will demonstrate to the World that these horrible, deadly Wars, and violent Conflicts must end. Millions are dying, and Kamala Harris is in no way capable of stopping it.\"\n\nTrump originally posted that Mr Netanyahu would visit earlier in the week, but added an update saying that the Israeli leader had requested to change the meeting day from Thursday to Friday.\n\nCould there be a more pejorative, more misogynistic label to give a woman than \"childless cat lady\"?

If we didn't already know JD Vance, Donald Trump's pick for Republican vice president was a wrong 'un, here's the incontrovertible proof.\n\nA video, from back in 2021, has emerged showing Vance (a father of three, if anyone cares) referring to Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting and mother-of-none Kamala Harris as \"one of the \"childless cat ladies\" who are \"miserable at their own lives\" and have \"no stake in the nation's future\".\n\nRead the full comment piece here.\n\nKamala Harris is more popular than Donald Trump, according to the first national poll carried out since Joe Biden stood down.\n\nResearch by Ipsos and Reuters published on Tuesday shows Ms Harris leads Trump by two points nationally, by 44 per cent of the vote to 42 per cent.\n\nA previous poll by the same firm previously found that Trump led Mr Biden by two points.\n\nThe survey suggests the Ms Harris, the now presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, has a fighting chance of overturning Trump's lead in the swing states ahead of the presidential election on November 5.\n\nWe're bringing you the latest updates from the US election.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNorthwoods Falls closes in St. John, owners hope temporarily Davich: Frankly, this is the best hot dog joint in the Region Ex-Crown Point real estate agents indicted on charges of $5 million in COVID relief fraud after allegedly spending money on Porsche and country club UPDATE: Valpo man identified as motorcyclist killed when SUV reportedly made sudden U-turn Valparaiso tornado confirmed as county calls state in for help Mascot Hall of Fame to close in September, 'going out with confetti' UPDATE: Cedar Lake woman killed in Monday's storm remembered as 'rock of the family' Crown Point man led chase, soiled police vehicle, report says Report: Man stopped from jumping to I-94 says officer was first to care for him in long time Former Lake County councilman could avoid jail time yet again in 3rd domestic battery case Valpo jewelry store burglarized; holes cut in wall, cops say Portage officers injured during high-speed chase with bikers armed with AK-47, report says Sunday night house fire draws out several departments NWI Business Ins and Outs: Royale with Cheese, Top of the Morning, Casa Blanca, Estella's Cantina, El Jimador, Jet's Pizza, Wingstop and Wing Snob opening Portage man upset over paying all the bills repeatedly fired gun in his backyard, cops say\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

In his remarks, though, he made clear he is not leaving the White House until his first term is done.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" Biden said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nBiden went on to condemn political violence and called for changes to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"I'm the first president of this century to report that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world,\" Biden said. During Biden's administration, however, two major international wars have broken out: Russia invaded Ukraine and Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, prompting the Jewish nation to respond. Both wars are ongoing.\n\nBiden has endorsed Harris, who has already gathered Democratic donors, delegates and key endorsements. She is the presumed Democratic nominee and likely will face former President Donald Trump in November. Democrats will officially nominate their candidate at their convention in Chicago next month, but could do so beforehand in a virtual vote.\n\nBiden experienced a medical incident in recent days that the White House said was COVID-19. Biden was not seen over the weekend, raising concerns and questions, especially since Sunday's major announcement that he would drop out of the race was made via letter, not video or public remarks.\n\nIn the Sunday letter, though, Biden promised to give more details later in the week. Mostly, though, Biden spent Wednesday's address reminding Americans of his record and wins while in office.\n\nHe went on to praise Harris, calling her a great leader and warning Americans against voting for Trump, though never using his name.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,\" Biden said.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden continued. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's handoff to Harris came after several brutal weeks for his campaign. Biden, who already faced ongoing questions about his mental fitness, had a disastrous debate with Trump at the end of June.\n\nAfter that debate, donors and elected Democrats began calling on Biden to leave the race, saying he could not beat Trump.\n\nA near-fatal assassination attempt against Trump further rallied support for the Republican presidential nominee, who was already leading Biden in national and most swing state polling.\n\nBiden refused for weeks to step aside as more and more Democrats called for him to leave the race, but over the weekend, he relented.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have continued to press Biden, arguing that if he is not fit to run for reelection, he is not fit to remain president.\n\n\"Does Lyin' Kamala Harris think Joe Biden is fit to run the U.S.A. for the next six months?\" Trump said in a statement. \"She must answer the question. Now it appears Joe is delegating his Presidential Authority to unelected Washington Bureaucrats! He doesn't even trust his Vice President. WHO IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY?\"\n\nTrump's Vice Presidential pick, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called on Biden to resign over the weekend.\n\n\"If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?\" Vance wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday. \"Not running for reelection would be a clear admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough to serve as Commander-in-Chief. There is no middle ground.\"", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@ktbs.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "casey_harper@ktbs.com", "name": "Casey Harper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said, in a somber coda to his 50 years spent in public office. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nEditorials Editorial: America never wanted a Biden-Trump rematch. A half change is a good start. BY THE EDITORIAL STAFF\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden, who said he believed his record was deserving of another term in office, tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to end his campaign only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out a weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, address climate change and push for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\nToday's Top Headlines\n\nStory continues below\n\nLowes Foods to shutter a Moncks Corner grocery store Georgetown County wants to turn conservation land into homes.

Palmetto Politics SC's Jim Clyburn urged Biden to back Kamala Harris in conversation before his exit By Caitlin Byrd cbyrd@postandcourier.com\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nNational and World News Trump picks Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, a once-fierce critic turned loyal ally, as his GOP running mate By JILL COLVIN, JULIE CARR SMYTH, STEVE PEOPLES and ZEKE MILLER Associated Press\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nSouth Carolina Dawn Staley is going to Olympics with First Lady Jill Biden By David Cloninger dcloninger@postandcourier.com\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.

I believe our record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term, but nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.\"\n\nBiden's 11-minute of remarks was a valedictory of his accomplishments during his term. He reminded that when he took office, the country was still in the midst of \"the worst pandemic in a century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression\" and \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\n\"We came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger and more prosperous and more secure,\" he said.\n\nThe president also talked of his political career, including more than 50 years in the Senate, as vice president and as president.\n\n\"No where else on earth could a kid with a stutter -- from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware -- one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of United States,\" Biden said. \"But here I am.\"\n\nBut Biden said that \"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" as he framed the upcoming election as one that will \"choose the course of America's future.\" He reiterated his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, while not mentioning the name of Donald Trump.\n\nInstead, as he outlined the stakes of the race, he quoted from Benjamin Franklin, asked if the founders had given the country a monarch or a republican. \"Franklin's response was, 'A republic -- if you can keep it.\"\n\nWith a whip round domestic and international situations, Biden laid out a fairly ambitious last few months of his administration at home and abroad. That includes what he called Supreme Court reform, with reports that he will propose setting term limits for justices rather than lifetime appointments.\n\nIn his speech, Biden did not talk of any health issues or concerns that he had slipped in recent months, culminating in a dismal debate performance on June 27. But in talking of his desire to unite the party, the president was referring to the three weeks of discord since then, as donors and lawmakers called for him to step aside given the stakes of the election.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: President Joe Biden plans to tell viewers Wednesday night that \"the defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" as he delivers an Oval Office address following his decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race.\n\n\"I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people,\" Biden plans to say, according to excerpts released today by the White House. \"But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures.\"\n\nBiden also plans to say that he \"decided that the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden returned to the White House on Tuesday, two days after he released a letter on X/Twitter announcing that he was standing down in the presidential campaign. Shortly after that, he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take his place atop the Democratic ticket.\n\nBroadcast networks plan special reports on Biden's remarks, set to start at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT, with coverage also across cable news and streaming channels.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden also plans to say that he will be \"focused on my job as president\" in the remaining six months of his term.\n\n\"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote - to the right to choose,\" Biden plans to say.\n\n\"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote - to the right to choose,\" the president will say.\n\nEarlier today, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters that the suggestion that Biden should resign now was \"ridiculous.\" She said that the president's decision to drop out of the race was \"not about his health,\" and that he believed that he could serve another four years. She said that the decision to drop out was made on Saturday evening, when he met with a small group of advisers, and the decision was finalized the next day. The letter was posted to social media at 1:46 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee's Rules Committee this afternoon approved plans for a virtual roll call of delegates to select the next nominee as soon as August 1. Those plans were in the works before Biden dropped out because of concerns that the Democratic National Convention, to be held August 19-22 in Chicago, would be too close to state ballot deadlines.\n\nHarris already has amassed enough pledged delegates to secure the nomination, with no major opposition challenging her so far.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whip (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymont,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claymont, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Claymont, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People'.\"\n\nBiden ended his campaign for a second term on Sunday after weeks of pressure from nervous Democrats and major donors, who feared he would lose to former President Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. Biden's withdrawal threw the presidential race into unchartered territory just four months before the election, USA Today reported.\n\nVice-President Kamala Harris quickly announced that she would run for President, and Biden offered her his endorsement.\n\nHarris has since raised more than $126 million for her nascent campaign and has already secured more than enough delegates to win the Democratic Party's nomination.\n\nIn the letter announcing his decision to pull out of the race, Biden said while it had always been his intention to run for a second term, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nThe pressure on Biden to drop out started to build after a disastrous debate with Trump last month raised questions about his physical and mental acuity and his ability to serve another four-year term. But the White House insisted on Monday, just a few hours before Biden's speech, that concerns about his health had nothing to do with his decision to exit the race.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden made it clear he plans to serve out the remainder of his term, USA Today reported.\n\nHe said he plans to spend the next six months doing his job as President - working to lower costs for families, growing the economy and defending personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\nHe added that he would continue rallying a coalition of allies to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine and would keep working to end the war in Gaza and bring peace to the Middle East.\n\nBiden said he would also continue to pursue Supreme Court reform and his \"Moonshot\" program to end cancer.\n\nThe US remains a nation of \"promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers,\" he added.\n\nWhile Biden spoke, First Lady Jill Biden, son Hunter Biden and other members of his family stood along the Oval Office's curved walls.\n\nIn a reference to the upcoming election, Biden gave a shoutout to Harris, saying she had been an incredible partner and a leader for the country.\n\nNow, he said, the future direction of the country is up to the American people.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" he said.\n\n\"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

He did not directly call out Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to democracy. The 10-minute address also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history will remember his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNorthwoods Falls closes in St. John, owners hope temporarily Davich: Frankly, this is the best hot dog joint in the Region Ex-Crown Point real estate agents indicted on charges of $5 million in COVID relief fraud after allegedly spending money on Porsche and country club UPDATE: Valpo man identified as motorcyclist killed when SUV reportedly made sudden U-turn Valparaiso tornado confirmed as county calls state in for help Mascot Hall of Fame to close in September, 'going out with confetti' UPDATE: Cedar Lake woman killed in Monday's storm remembered as 'rock of the family' Crown Point man led chase, soiled police vehicle, report says Report: Man stopped from jumping to I-94 says officer was first to care for him in long time Former Lake County councilman could avoid jail time yet again in 3rd domestic battery case Valpo jewelry store burglarized; holes cut in wall, cops say Portage officers injured during high-speed chase with bikers armed with AK-47, report says Sunday night house fire draws out several departments NWI Business Ins and Outs: Royale with Cheese, Top of the Morning, Casa Blanca, Estella's Cantina, El Jimador, Jet's Pizza, Wingstop and Wing Snob opening Portage man upset over paying all the bills repeatedly fired gun in his backyard, cops say\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Biden said. \"And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nIt was a moment for the history books -- a U.S. president reflecting before the nation on why he was taking the rare step of voluntarily handing off power. It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nSaid Biden, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, saying he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer, and call for Supreme Court reform.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

There's also a time and a place for new voices fresh voices. Yes, younger voices.'\n\nBiden did not address questions over his own age, health and mental acuity, which have undermined his presidency from the start.\n\nDoubts about his ability to do the job intensified following a disastrous debate performance last month, which led senior Democrats to call for him to leave the 2024 presidential race.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, in an Oval Office address, revealed why he decided to step down as the Democratic nominee\n\nFrom right: Jill Biden, Ashley Biden and husband Howard Krein, and Hunter Biden and his daugther Finnegan listen to Joe Biden speak\n\nAs Biden spoke his wife Jill Biden, and children Hunter and Ashley, sat to his left along a wall watching his valedictory.\n\nAlso present were several of his grandchildren including Naomi Biden and Maisy Biden.\n\nThe family broke into applause when the president finished speaking. Jill Biden joined him at the Resolute Desk, and Hunter Biden hugged his father.\n\nBiden, who has just recovered from a bout of COVID fumbled briefly in his delivery, mumbling at times.\n\nHe used the address to outline his legacy and said he has more work to do in the six months he has left in office.\n\nHunter Biden gives his dad a hug\n\nHe said: 'I revere this office but I love my country more.\n\n'It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president but the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than a title.'\n\nBiden made it clear he is stepping down voluntarily, drawing a stark contrast with his predecessor.\n\nHe did not mention Donald Trump by name but talked about how the country is more important than ambition to stay in the Oval Office.\n\n'America is an idea - an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator,' Biden said.\n\nAs the president spoke, his staff were gathered one floor up, on the state floor of the White House, to watch his remarks with wine and pizza.\n\nBefore the speech began, staffers were spotted walking in from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is across the street of the West Wing, into the White House proper for the event.\n\nBiden's decision to step down sent shock waves throughout the world and ended his political career that has lasted more than 50 years.\n\nHe has already endorsed Harris and turned over his campaign infrastructure to her. The campaign has renamed itself 'Harris for President.'\n\nWithin 30 hours of Biden announcing on Sunday that he was stepping aside Harris had pledges from enough delegates to win the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday night, Biden did not explicitly endorse Harris but noted he had 'made my views known.'\n\nHe said: 'I made my choice. I've made my views known. I'd like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\n\n'Now the choice is up to you, the American people.'\n\nHunter Biden, his daughter Finnegan, Howard Krein, Ashley Biden and Jill Biden in the Oval\n\nJill Biden joined Joe Biden at the Resolute Desk when he finished his speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden returning to Delaware after being diagnosed with COVID\n\nDemocratic delegates will nominate their presidential ticket virtually in early August ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off August 19th in Chicago.\n\nThe president returned to the White House on Tuesday after spending six days isolating in his beach house in Delaware, where he was suffering from COVID.\n\nHe has canceled a West Coast fundraising swing scheduled for the end of the week.\n\nHe will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday.\n\nBiden spent weeks rebuffing pressure from senior figures in his party to step down as its nominee. But, on Sunday, he bowed to the inevitable.\n\nHe is the first incumbent president not to seek re-election since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, abruptly pulled out of the campaign on March 31.\n\nThe president also joins James K. Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford B. Hayes, Calvin Coolidge and Harry Truman as presidents who all decided not to stand for a second term.\n\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday denied there was a 'cover-up' of Biden's declining health and mental capabilities by staff and Biden family members.\n\nBiden's top spokesperson was grilled repeatedly about his apparent change of heart when it came to a second term and denied his health had anything to do with the decision.\n\nDuring her press briefing - the first since Biden's historic decision to step down as the Democratic nominee - Fox News' Peter Doocy asked her: 'It would seem that people in this White House knew that President Biden was slipping and it was hidden from the American people - so who ordered White House officials to coverup a declining president?'\n\n'There's been no coverup,' she replied.\n\nFor weeks Jean-Pierre and other aides had denied Biden was considering leaving the presidential race.\n\nThey had denied reports his health was on the decline.\n\nBut, in the June 26th presidential debate, Biden repeatedly fumbled for words and froze on camera, leading to questions from his own party about his ability to serve a second term in the White House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre denied there was a 'coverup' of President Joe Biden 's health and mental capabilities\n\nJean-Pierre said the president made his decision in 'very short period of time.'\n\nShe pushed back against reports that aides, lawmakers and Democratic officials had noticed for months that Biden was on the decline.\n\nShe also said his health was not a factor in his decision to exit the presidential race.\n\n'It has nothing to do with his health,' she said. 'I can say, no, that's not the reason.'\n\nShe also called calls for the president to resign from office 'ridiculous.'\n\nThere have been questions as to why, if Biden can't serve four more years, he can serve six more months.\n\nJean-Pierre argued that Biden was capable of serving out a full second term.\n\n'He didn't step down from from campaigning or from running because he didn't believe he can serve in a second term. That is not why,' she said.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Krein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard Krein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Executive_Office_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eisenhower Executive Office Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James K.

He was determined to show that he would not act like a lame-duck president, outlining an ambitious agenda that underscored his resolve to continue building on his legacy.\n\nBiden did not mention Trump, his former Republican opponent, in his 10-minute Oval Office address -- but he didn't have to. The remarks were imbued with a deep sense of urgency about what the outgoing president saw as the stakes of the election.\n\nThe early part of his address sketched the choices that faces voters in November -- a contrast Biden himself had hoped to make during a reelection campaign that he ultimately decided he could not continue.\n\n\"Americans are going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,\" Biden said. \"We have to decide -- do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nThat last item -- democracy -- and defending it is \"more important than any title,\" Biden said.\n\nThe president says he's going to keep working over his final six months in office. He's seeking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.\n\nHis to-do list was full of weighty issues. He said he'd work to end the war in Gaza, bring home the hostages and try \"to bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.\" Biden meets Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHe's going to continue to work to lower costs for families and defend personal freedoms, keep calling out \"hate and extremism\" and push to end gun violence.\n\nHe also said he would continue to work on his initiative to end cancer as we know it and push for Supreme Court reforms.\n\n\"I'm going to keep working,\" he said.\n\nBiden finally understood what Democrats had been telling him -- that it was time to hand off power to a younger generation -- and he embraced it, calling for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices\" in politics.\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" he said, even as he believed his presidency was deserving of a second term.\n\nFor months, Biden insisted that only he could go up against Trump and win. But that changed following his debate with Trump on June 27, when he spoke haltingly, lost his train of thought and failed to fact-check the former president's falsehoods. The performance raised a chorus of questions about his age and ability to do the job another four years and pushed Democrats to increasingly call for him to step aside. The standoff dragged for 24 days before Biden yielded, saying he needed to unify his party.\n\nBiden is not a stranger to the sober address, delivering remarks on weighty matters such as the fate of democracy and voting rights at historically significant landmarks across the country and around the globe.\n\nBut Biden has used the formal trappings of an Oval Office address -- a tool used by presidents in times of national crisis or to capture a key moment in history -- sparsely, with Wednesday's speech marking just the fourth time that he has sat behind the Resolute Desk to speak directly to the nation.\n\nHis tone was solemn, the delivery careful and deliberate. He was surrounded by family and close aides as he gave an address willingly relinquishing power -- one that no politician wants to make.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule -- that people do,\" Biden said as he closed his address. \"History is in your hands.

He was determined to show that he would not act like a lame-duck president, outlining an ambitious agenda that underscored his resolve to continue building on his legacy.\n\nHe warned about Trump - without naming him. Biden did not mention Trump, his former Republican opponent, in his 10-minute Oval Office address - but he didn't have to. The remarks were imbued with a deep sense of urgency about what the outgoing president saw as the stakes of the election.\n\nThe early part of his address sketched the choices that faces voters in November - a contrast Biden himself had hoped to make during a reelection campaign that he ultimately decided he could not continue.\n\n\"Americans are going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,\" Biden said. \"We have to decide - do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\" That last item - democracy - and defending it is \"more important than any title,\" Biden said.\n\nOutlines to-do list for remaining tenure\n\nBiden outlined a hefty to-do list for his final months. The president says he's going to keep working over his final six months in office. He's seeking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.\n\nHis to-do list was full of weighty issues. He said he'd work to end the war in Gaza, bring home the hostages and try \"to bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.\" Biden meets Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHe's going to continue to work to lower costs for families and defend personal freedoms, keep calling out \"hate and extremism\" and push to end gun violence.\n\nHe also said he would continue to work on his initiative to end cancer as we know it and push for Supreme Court reforms.\n\n\"I'm going to keep working,\" he said.\n\nTime to 'pass the torch' to the next generation: Biden\n\nHe is willingly handing off power to a new generation. Biden finally understood what Democrats had been telling him - that it was time to hand off power to a younger generation - and he embraced it, calling for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices\" in politics.\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" he said, even as he believed his presidency was deserving of a second term.\n\nFor months, Biden insisted that only he could go up against Trump and win. But that changed following his debate with Trump on June 27, when he spoke haltingly, lost his train of thought and failed to fact-check the former president's falsehoods. The performance raised a chorus of questions about his age and ability to do the job another four years and pushed Democrats to increasingly call for him to step aside. The standoff dragged for 24 days before Biden yielded, saying he needed to unify his party.\n\nThe tone and setting were solemn. Biden is not a stranger to the sober address, delivering remarks on weighty matters such as the fate of democracy and voting rights at historically significant landmarks across the country and around the globe.\n\nBut Biden has used the formal trappings of an Oval Office address - a tool used by presidents in times of national crisis or to capture a key moment in history - sparsely, with Wednesday's speech marking just the fourth time that he has sat behind the Resolute Desk to speak directly to the nation.\n\nHis tone was solemn, the delivery careful and deliberate. He was surrounded by family and close aides as he gave an address willingly relinquishing power - one that no politician wants to make.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule - that people do,\" Biden said as he closed his address. \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\" Biden made a subtle push for his vice president. In the official setting of the Oval Office, Biden steered clear of overt political talk. But he still praised Vice President Kamala Harris as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" and gave a not-so-subtle push to voters.\n\n\"She's been an incredible partner for her leadership, for our country,\" he said. \"Now the choice is up to you, the American people. \" First lady Jill Biden posted a hand-written note after the president's speech thanking \"those who never wavered, who refused to doubt.\"\n\nShe thanked supporters for putting their trust in the president. \"Now it's time to put that trust in Kamala.\"\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump.

He has endorsed Kamala Harris, his vice-president, for the Democratic nomination ahead of this year's presidential election.\n\nMr Biden said: \"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term.\n\n\"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\n\"So I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation as the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden had faced weeks of criticism from senior members of his own party, who argued his age and health would prevent him from beating Donald Trump for a second time in November.\n\nHe was resistant to calls from some of his closest allies, including Nancy Pelosi, for him to step down, before he posted a letter on X, formerly Twitter, announcing he was suspending his campaign. He then endorsed Ms Harris to replace him.\n\n\"The defence of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people,\" he said on Wednesday night.\n\n\"But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nSurrounded by photographs of his family in the Oval Office, Mr Biden quoted both the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence during his short address. He did not take any questions.\n\nHe also laid out a series of his achievements in office, including his flagship \"Bidenomics\" policies, crime reduction and his appointment of the first black woman as a justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Biden did not refer specifically to Trump, who eroded his lead in swing states before his decision to stand down, but stressed that he had decided to quit the race because of threats to American democracy. He has previously referred to Trump as a \"dictator\".\n\n\"We're all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,\" he said.\n\n\"We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either.\n\n\"And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now. In just a few months, the American people choose the course of America's future.\"\n\nMr Biden ended his remarks by thanking the public for giving \"a kid with a stutter\" the opportunity to serve as president.\n\nHe said: \"Here I am. That's what's so special about America. We're a nation of promise and possibilities of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.\"\n\nFollowing his address, his family members shed tears as Mr Biden embraced them.\n\nMr Biden's address came after Ms Harris's second speech since she became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party earlier on Wednesday.\n\nShe has received the support of enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention to be awarded the nomination. The vast majority of delegates were previously allocated to Mr Biden after the party's primary race earlier this year.\n\nMr Biden promised to continue his work as president until January, when he will be replaced by the winner of this year's election. Some Republicans have called for him to stand down immediately.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. \"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hardworking families, [to] grow our economy.\n\n\"I'll keep defending our personal freedoms in our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\n\"I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, [and] make it clear there is no place in America for political violence, or any violence, ever.\"\n\nThanks for following the Telegraph's live blog. We'll back tomorrow with the latest updates on the US election.\n\nMr Biden said: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nMr Biden praised Kamala Harris for being \"experienced, tough and capable,\" and said that when voters cast their ballots in November they should remember the words of Benjamin Franklin that America is a \"Republic, if you can keep it\".\n\nHe added: \"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this country for 50 years of my life.\"\n\nMr Biden said: \"I ran for preisdent four years ago because I believe the soul of America is at stake...and that's still the case.\"\n\nMr Biden said: \"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as President. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote - to the right to choose.\"\n\nHe also said he would focus on ending gun violence, developments in cancer research, and ending US involvement in wars around the globe.\n\nMr Biden said that \"nothing, nothing\" could stand in the way of \"saving our democracy, adding: \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden said America was at a crossroads and \"has to choose\" between \"hope and hate\".\n\nJoe Biden has begun his address to the American people from the Oval Office.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the US president said: \"The defense of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nThe acting director of the US Secret Service will testify before three Senate committees on Thursday in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of former President Donald Trump, the committees announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe deputy director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation will also testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is holding a hearing in partnership with the Senate Homeland Security Committee and the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nKimberly Cheatle resigned as director of the US Secret Service on Tuesday after bipartisan demands to quit over the failure to prevent the attempted assassination. Ronald L Rowe Jr. replaced her as acting director.\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic Party bosses were behind Mr Biden's decision to step down and accused Ms Harris of covering up the US president's \"mental unfitness.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the White House denied it had covered up any possible decline in Biden's health prior to his decision to drop out of the election race.\n\nTrump called Ms Harris \"the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.\"\n\nHe claimed that she wanted \"abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy\" as well as \"right up until birth and even after birth, the execution of a baby.\"\n\nDonald Trump claimed Kamala Harris was in favor of the \"execution\" of babies due to her stance on abortions, adding: \"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country.\"\n\n\"We're not going to let that happen,\" he told the crowd in North Carolina.\n\nDonald Trump unleashed a series of attacks on Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since Joe Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nAppearing in Charlotte, North Carolina, a battleground state that carries 16 electoral college votes, Mr Trump dubbed the Vice President \"Lyin' Kamala\", a description he first levelled at Republican Senator Ted Cruz during the 2016 GOP primary.\n\nReports suggest the Trump campaign has been scrambling on how to respond since Mr Biden announced at the weekend he was dropping out of the race. Polls suggest the 59-year-old Ms Harris could be more competitive in several states than Mr Biden, not because she is 20 year younger than Trump.\n\n\"Lyin' Kamala is most left wing politician in the country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"She's absolutely terrible. She's, as you know, more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Can you believe it? She's rated far more liberal than Bernie. She's now trying to get rid of her record, but you can't.\"\n\nMs Harris has previously hit back at Trump, referencing her time at Attorney General of California and suggesting she had dealt with people like the former president, who earlier this year became the US president convicted of a crime.\n\nThe former president's trip to North Carolina suggested he is still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nThe last Democrat to win North Carolina was Barack Obama in 2008. But Ms Harris's supporters believe the state could be in play, especially if she picks Governor Roy Cooper as her running mate.\n\nDonald Trump said \"lyin' Kamala\" is the most left wing politician in America, more so than Bernie Sanders.\n\nDonald Trump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nDonald Trump accused Kamala Harris of being a \"radical left lunatic\" Wednesday, in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee in the White House race.\n\n\"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\" the former president and Republican nominee claimed, calling her \"the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.\"\n\nJoe Biden said on X he would discuss \"what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people\" in his televised speech Wednesday night.\n\nThe US president returned to the White House on Tuesday after spending nearly a week with Covid at his Delaware beach home, a period of isolation in which he took the decision to step back from the presidential race.\n\nRepublicans have called for Mr Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.\n\nA White House spokesman dismissed that as \"ridiculous\" and maintained that Mr Biden is no \"lame duck.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden stunned the world when he announced Sunday that he would not seek reelection, bowing to weeks of pressure after a disastrous, stumbling debate performance against Trump last month.\n\nThe veteran Democrat will tonight deliver his first speech since bowing out of the presidential race, using the powerfully symbolic setting of the Oval Office to try to restore some dignity as the clock ticks on his presidency and a half-century in public service.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, told reporters Wednesday that Mr Biden's decision has \"nothing to do with his health.\"\n\nShe denied that the White House had covered up any possible decline in Biden's condition. \"It is not a cover up. I know that is the narrative that you all want. It is not,\" she said.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu told US lawmakers on Wednesday that Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza and that after the war with Hamas the enclave should be led by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy his country.\n\nSpeaking to a joint meeting of Congress, the Israeli prime minister said that for the foreseeable future, however, Israel would need overriding security control of Gaza.\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the Donald Trump speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nJamie Raskin, a Democrat representative from Maryland, said Benjamin Netanyahu's speech was made for Donald Trump's GOP.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral ceasefire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\n\nHamas has responded to Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in the US congress calling for a new alliance in the Middle East by labelling Muslims who join it \"treasonous\".\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, told Reuters on Wednesday that an alliance with Mr Netanyahu from any party is a \"treason to the blood of martyrs\".\n\nIn his speech addressing the US Congress earlier on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said the US and Israel can forge a security alliance in the Middle East to counter an Iranian \"threat\", saying that all countries which will make peace with Israel should join such an alliance.\n\nAt Union Station, protesters have removed American flags from the building and set them alight, while burning an effigy of Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSome protesters climbed a flag pole and chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged a person away.\n\nAt least two people were seen being treated for the effect of chemical agents to the eyes.\n\nThousands of people protesting Israel's war in Gaza are marching in Washington chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as they filled blocks of city streets.\n\nPolice used pepper spray on demonstrators while Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress.\n\nDemonstrators calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians marched toward the Capitol but were blocked by police from getting closer to the building.\n\nDemonstrators rallied near the Capitol before marching toward the building ahead of Mr Netanyahu's address to the joint session of Congress.\n\nAfter blocking a nearby intersection, protesters chanted, \"Shut it down!\" as they marched behind a banner that said \"globalize the student intifada.\"\n\n\"Bibi, Bibi, We're not done! The intifada has just begun!\" they shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Other protesters chanted, \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide.\"\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu told Congress he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Mr Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister called Wednesday for a demilitarized and deradicalized post-war Gaza, laying out his vision for the narrow coastal territory devastated by nine months of war.\n\n\"Following our victory, with the help of regional partners, the demilitarization and deradicalization of Gaza can also lead to a future of security, prosperity and peace. That's my vision for Gaza,\" Mr Netanyahu told US lawmakers.\n\nMr Netanyahu called on the US to fast-track military aid to his country to help end the war in Gaza, after previously accusing Washington of holding up assistance.\n\n\"I deeply appreciate America's support, including in this current war. But this is an exceptional moment. Fast-tracking US military aid could dramatically expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader war in the Middle East,\" Mr Netanyahu told the US Congress.\n\nThe Israeli leader said accusations that Israel was causing a famine in Gaza were akin to an anti-Semitic \"blood libel\".\n\n\"Don't be fooled when the blood libels against the Jewish state come from people who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu cited the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court accusing Israel of deliberately starving Gazans as a \"case in point\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said this was a \"complete fabrication\" and that Israel had \"enabled\" 40,000 aid trucks, or half a million tonnes of food, to enter into Gaza since the war began.\n\n\"That's more than 3,000 calories for every man, woman and child in Gaza. If there are Palestinians in Gaza who are not getting enough food, it's not because Israel are blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said: \"The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimise Israel, to demonise the Jewish state and to demonise Jews everywhere.\n\n\"And no wonder we've witnessed an appalling rise in anti-Semitism in America and around the world. My friends, whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti-Semitism we must unequivocally condemn it and resolutely fight it, without exceptions.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu added: \"We (Jews) were accused of everything from poisoning wells, spreading plagues, to using the blood of children to bake Passover matzahs (bread). These preposterous anti-Semitic lies led to persecution, mass murder and ultimately, to history's worst genocide: the Holocaust.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu took aim at the equivocations of university leaders in the face of antisemitism on American college campuses.\n\nHe said: \"80 years after the Holocaust, the presidents of Harvard, Penn and I'm ashamed to say, my alma mater, MIT, couldn't bring themselves to condemn the calls for the genocide of Jews...they said it depends on the context.\n\n\"Well let me give these befuddled academics some context: Antisemitism is the world's oldest hatred. For centuries the massacre of Jews was always preceded by wild accusations.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu added: \"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza. They might as well hold up signs saying chickens for KFC.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said US anti-Israel protestors were \"Iran's useful idiots\".\n\nHe said: \"For all we know Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests outside this building...Well I have a message for these protestors: when the tyrants of Tehran who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nThe Israeli prime minister said: \"These protestors burn American flags even on the fourth of July. I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina who protected the American flag against these anti-Israel protestors.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said: \"They (protestors) refuse to make the simple distinction between those who target terrorists and those who target civilians; between the democratic state of Israel and the terrorist thugs of Hamas.\n\n\"We recently learned from the US director of national intelligence that Iran is funding and promoting anti-Israel protests in America. They (Iran) want to disrupt America.\"\n\nHe said anti-Israel \"protestors should be ashamed of themselves\" for \"standing with\" Hamas. Many US lawmakers in the gallery stood up and cheered his remarks.\n\nMr Netanyahu said the lessons of the Holocaust must be heeded and that for Israel, \"never again must never be an empty promise\".\n\nMr Netanyahu heaped praise on the bravery of the Israeli army, calling them the \"lions of Judah\".\n\n\"These, ladies and gentlemen, are the soldiers of Israel: unbowed, undaunted, unafraid...they have risen like lions\", he said.\n\n\"The lions of Judah, the lions of Israel...the men and women of the IDF come from every corner of Israeli society, every colour, every creed...all are imbued with the spirit of the Maccabees (ancient Jewish warriors).\"\n\nHe added: \"Because of them, the Jewish people are no longer helpless in the face of our enemies.\"\n\nIsrael, the United States and the Arab world are under threat from Iran's \"axis of terror,\" Benjamin Netanyahu told lawmakers in a landmark speech before the US Congress on Wednesday.\n\n\"Our world is in upheaval. In the Middle East, Iran's axis of terror confronts America, Israel and our Arab friends. This is not a clash of civilizations. It's a clash between barbarism and civilization,\" Mr Netanyahu said.\n\nMr Netanyahu highlighted the bravery of one of the first responders on October 7 who was in attendance at his speech.\n\n\"He ran eight miles to the front lines of Gaza to defend his people,\" Mr Netanyahu said. \"He ran eight miles, came to the front lines, killed many terrorists, and saved many, many lives...we all honour his remarkable heroism.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said President Biden had told him he was a \"proud Irish American Zionist\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said further efforts were underway to free more hostages and thanked President Joe Biden for his efforts to help to secure their release.\n\nHe also lauded Mr Biden for calling Hamas \"sheer evil\" in the wake of the October 7 attack.\n\nThe Israeli leader said \"many hostage families\" had accompanied him to the Congress on Wednesday.\n\nDiscussing one family, he said \"two beautiful red haired children were taken hostage, what monsters\".\n\nHe added: \"The pain these families have endured is beyond words.\"\n\nMr Netanyahu said that, as a proportion of the population sizes of the US and Israel, the October 7 Hamas massacre in Israel was comparable to \"20 9/11s in one day\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said America and Israel \"must stand together\", adding: \"I want to assure you today that we will win.\"\n\nAddressing the packed-out stands, Mr Netanyahu said: \"I want to thank you for giving me the profound honour of addressing this great citadel of democracy for the fourth time. We meet today at a crossroads of history.\"\n\nHe said the war in Israel was not a \"clash of civillisations\" but a clash \"between barbarism and civilisation\".\n\nThe Israeli leader waved at congressmen and thanked his hosts for inviting him to speak, with his opening remarks delayed by claps and cheers.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu has entered the US congress to cheers and rounds of applause, with some US lawmakers reaching out to shake his hand.\n\nDemonstrators rallied near the Capitol before marching toward the building ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's address to the joint session of Congress.\n\nAfter blocking a nearby intersection, protesters chanted, \"Shut it down!\" as they marched behind a banner that said \"globalize the student intifada.\"\n\n\"Bibi, Bibi, We're not done! The intifada has just begun!\" they shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Other protesters chanted, \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide.\"\n\nAmong the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns. They said the sculpture took months to construct and is meant to represent Joe Biden's unwillingness to stand up to Israel.\n\nPolice are dousing protesters outside the US Capitol building with pepper spray, after pro-Palestine and pro-Israel demonstrators clashed ahead of Benjamin Netanyahu's speech.\n\nHundreds of activists, the majority of whom oppose Mr Netanyahu, have launched a protest against the Israeli prime minister's speech.\n\nMr Netanyahu is due to speak shortly from the Senate chamber. Dozens of congressmen have boycotted the speech in protest of Israeli military action in Gaza.\n\nElon Musk has said he will attend Benjamin Netanyahu's address in the US Capitol on Wednesday as a guest of the Israeli prime minister, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday citing a spokesperson for Mike Johnson, the House speaker.\n\nSince at least her time as attorney general of California, Kamala Harris has been pro-abortion and has championed women's rights to access reproductive health care.\n\nIn her first stops on the campaign trail since Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Ms Harris pushed for legislation that would safeguard abortion rights.\n\n\"We will fight for reproductive freedom knowing if Trump gets the chance, he will sign a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single state,\" she told supporters and staff in Delaware this week.\n\nOn the other hand, Donald Trump has taken credit for his three US Supreme Court appointments that preceded the court's June 2022 ruling that overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that recognized a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nBut on the campaign trail, he has appeared wary of the political blowback his party has taken on the issue over the last two years.\n\nPolls show that a large majority of Americans say abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMs Harris said: \"When Donald Trump was president he handpicked three members of the Supreme Court because he intended for them to overturn Roe v Wade...and as intended they did.\n\n\"Well let me tell you something, when I am president of the United States, and when congress passes a law to restore those freedoms, I will sign it into law.\"\n\nAfter enumerating the legislation she plans to pass while in office on America's most fraught political issues, including voting rights, gun control and abortion, Ms Harris concluded: \"We are not playing around\".\n\nMs Harris vowed to expand voting rights and enact stricter gun control laws.\n\nShe said: \"In the face of these attacks we must continue to stand together in defence of freedom. We who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will make sure that every American has the ability to cast their ballot and have it counted.\n\n\"We who believe that every person in our nation should be free from gun violence will finally pass universal background checks, red flag laws and an assault weapons ban.\"\n\nMs Harris said: \"Ours is a fight for the future. And ours is a fight for freedom.\"\n\n\"Across our nation we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights: the freedom to vote; the freedom to be safe from gun violence; the freedom to live without freedom from biggotry and hate...the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history and the freedom for a women to make decisions about her own body and not have her government telling her what to do.\"\n\nMs Harris added: \"Let's be clear, this represents an outright attack on our children, our families and our future. These extremists want to take us back, but we are not going back. We are not going back.\"\n\nMs Harris said: \"You may have seen (Trump's) agenda: project 2025. Can you believe they put that in writing? It is a plan to return America to a dark past.\n\n\"They intend to cut Medicare. To repeal our 35 dollar cap on insulin. To eliminate the department of education. To end programmes like Head Start, which would take away free school for hundreds of thousands of children in our communities.\"\n\nWarming to her theme, Ms Harris said she believes in a future of social justice for working class Americans.\n\n\"In this moment, I believe we face a choice of two diff visions for our nation,\" Ms Harris said. \"One focused on the future, one focused on the past.\"\n\nShe added: \"I am fighting for this nation's future... we here believe in a future where everyone has affordable healthcare...We believe in a future where the economy works for working people, that's why we forgave student debt for five million Americans...And we are finally making it so that medical debt can no longer be used against a credit score.\"\n\nMs Harris added: \"I deeply believe in the promise of America. A promise of freedom, opportunity and justice. Not for some but for all.\"\n\nKamala Harris told a crowd in Indianapolis that she envisions a future for America where \"everybody has opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead\".\n\n\"A future of social justice, health justice, economic justice,\" she added.\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against launching personal attacks against Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, Richard Hudson, National Republican Congressional committee chairman, urged lawmakers to stick to criticising Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" Mike Johnson, the House speaker, told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nElon Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and SpaceX, is attending this afternoon's speech by Benjamin Netanyahu to both houses of Congress.\n\nVoters in Indiana have not backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But Kamala Harris visited the solidly Republican state on Wednesday and will speak to a constituency she hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers in November: \"women of color\".\n\nJust three days after launching her bid for the White House following President Joe Biden's departure from the race, Ms Harris will address the biennial gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Ms Harris, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign hopes can expand its coalition.\n\nIn a memo released on Wednesday, Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris campaign chair, pointed to support among female, nonwhite and younger voters as critical to success.\n\nDonald Trump's would-be assassin flew a drone in the area near the rally just two hours before the former president took the stage, the FBI Director told the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nChristopher Wray revealed that at \"around 4pm\", sniper Thomas Matthew Crooks \"was flying the drone around the area\" of the packed campaign rally in Butler, Pennslyvania, approximately 200 yards from the stage.\n\nThe drone was in the air for approximately 11 minutes, and investigators believe Mr Crooks watched a live feed from the drone on his phone.\n\nIt has been reported that the drone was found in his car following the shooting.\n\nHours before Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu addresses the US Congress, a former member of his war cabinet has accused him of delaying progress on a Gaza ceasefire-hostage deal.\n\nBenny Gantz, leader of the National Unity party, told Mr Netanyahu to \"put your money where your mouth is\" on a hostage deal, accusing the prime minister of delaying an announcement for political reasons.\n\n\"The outline for the return of the hostages that we drew up has already been accepted -- the fact that they are waiting for the Knesset break to promote it is proof that political considerations have penetrated the holy of holies of Israel's security,\" Mr Gantz said.\n\nThat outline, first drawn up in May, \"should be implemented in a short period of time,\" he said.\n\n\"The hostages do not have another day, and there is not another minute. Since the previous outline, we have lost a quarter of the hostages alive,\" he added.\n\nMr Gantz resigned from the war cabinet in June, in a sign of spiraling divisions over Mr Netanyahu's post-conflict plans for Gaza.\n\nRepublican leadership has told its members to stop making comments about the race of Kamala Harris and instead focus on her record.\n\nThe chair of the House Republican campaign arm, Richard Hudson, issued the warning during a closed-door meeting on Tuesday after several lawmakers branded the vice-president a \"DEI\" pick, referring to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nRepresentative Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, told CNN on Monday that President Biden selected Ms Harris as his running mate solely because she is black.\n\n\"One hundred percent she is a DEI hire,\" he said. \"Her record is abysmal at best.\"\n\nGlenn Grothman, Representative for Wisconsin, similarly questioned if Democrats are only backing her \"because of her ethnic background.\"\n\nTheir comments, among others, are said to have angered their colleagues.\n\n\"This should not be about personalities. It should be about policy. And we have a record to compare,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said after the meeting on Tuesday.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will boycott Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress on Wednesday\n\nMs Pelosi's spokesperson, Ian Krager, said she will instead join a \"members' meeting with Israeli citizens whose families have suffered in the wake of the October 7th Hamas terror attack and kidnappings.\"\n\nThe snub is the latest in a growing tide of prominent Democrats, including vice-president Kamala Harris, and two Republicans who will skip the speech amid Israel's ruthless military campaign in the Gaza Strip.\n\nRoughly 200 people were arrested on Tuesday during a pro-Palestinian protest in a congressional building the day before Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress.\n\nThe demonstration, which took place in the Cannon House Office Building, was organized by Jewish Voice for Peace.\n\nCapitol police said they warned protesters, who were chanting pro-Palestinian slogans, that their inside demonstration was \"unlawful\".\n\nJoe Biden will meet with Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday at the Oval Office before they gather with the families of Americans held hostage by Hamas, the president's office said.\n\nIsrael's prime minister will meet separately with Kamala Harris, it added.\n\nKamala Harris will head to the solidly Republican state of Indiana on Wednesday as Donald Trump holds his first public campaign rally since Biden's exit from the 2024 race.\n\nThe vice-president will address the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis and deliver one of her first addresses as the presumptive Democratic nomination to women who represent the base she sees as critical to her success.\n\nMeanwhile, her Republican opponent will divide attention as he visits Charlotte, North Carolina to deliver a speech that will set the tone of his new campaign against Ms Harris.\n\nGraphic new bodycam footage shows the lifeless body of Donald Trump's would-be assassin moments after he was shot by secret agents.\n\nThe video shows local law enforcement and a Secret Service agent surrounding the corpse of the sniper, moments after he fired a volley of shots at former President Trump at a packed campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nRead more here.\n\nDonald Trump has featured on professional golfer's Bryson DeChambeau's Break 50 YouTube for a \"special\" charity episode.\n\nThe American, who won his second US Open at Pinehurst last month, said that the video was made to raise funds for the veterans charity, the Wounded Warrior Project.\n\nMr DeChambeau played down speculation that this was a political stunt to aid Trump's presidential campaign, adding: \"To be clear, this is about golf and giving back to our nation's veterans, not politics.\"\n\nHe added that the show was filmed during the first week of July before the attempt on Trump's life at a rally on July 13.\n\nDonald Trump has said he is committed to debating Kamala Harris and would be \"willing\" to square up with her more than once.\n\nThe next debate is scheduled for September 10 and is set to be hosted by ABC News. Trump has been arguing in recent days for a more conservative broadcaster like Fox News to hold it, calling ABC a \"joke\".\n\nDuring a conference call on Tuesday afternoon, Trump said he \"would be willing to do more than one debate actually\".\n\nHillary Clinton has boosted her support for Kamala Harris as she penned an op-ed that said the vice-president's campaign is likely to become an \"unstoppable wave\" that wipes out Donald Trump as a rival.\n\nThe former first lady and secretary of state also spoke of the \"ugly prejudice\" Ms Harris will - and already is - facing as a woman running for president in the New York Times column.\n\nThe Harris campaign has released a four-page memo outlining how she will win the presidential election in 100 days.\n\nThe document said she could make greater voter gains than Joe Biden achieved in 2020, particularly among undecided minority and young voters, and talked up her edge over the issue of reproductive rights.\n\n\"This campaign will be close, it will be hard fought, but Vice President Harris is in a position of strength - and she's going to win,\" wrote Jen O'Malley Dillon, the Biden-Harris campaign chair.\n\nThe memo said Ms Harris will be focused on the \"blue wall\" of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as well as the Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, where support for Mr Biden was waning.\n\n\"We intend to play offense in each of these states, and have the resources and campaign infrastructure to do so,\" Ms O'Malley Dillon added.\n\nDonald Trump told Volodymyr Zelensky in a phone call last week: \"We've got to get this war over. ... You're facing a war machine.\"\n\nIt was the first time the pair, who have a complicated history, have spoken since the former president left the White House. Trump called it a \"very good phone call\".\n\nThe Republican candidate revealed his comments to the Ukrainian leader in a Fox News interview that aired on Tuesday night, without answering whether he would curb funding to Kyiv.\n\nOlaf Scholz, Germany's chancellor, said he believed it was \"very possible\" Kamala Harris would win the US election later this year, but stopped short of endorsing the vice-president over Donald Trump.\n\nMr Scholz had been unusually direct in his endorsement of President Joe Biden before the latter dropped his re-election bid last weekend and endorsed Ms Harris.\n\n\"The election campaign in the USA will certainly be exciting, now with a slightly new line-up and a new constellation,\" Mr Scholz told an annual summer news conference on Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it is very possible that Kamala Harris will win the election, but the American voters will decide.\"\n\nDon Beyer, a representative for Virginia, has trolled the Republican party following the news that their leadership told members to stop their 'diversity hire' criticism aimed at Kamala Harris.\n\nIn response to the Politico headline: 'House GOP leaders urge members: Stop making race comments about Harris', the congressman wrote: \"Good luck with that\".\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing for a cease-fire deal and return of hostages.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, will make an address to Congress later today in the hopes of bolstering waning US support for continuing Israel's fight against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Mr Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges.\n\nA permit application estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\nElizabeth Warren, senator for Massachusetts, has been fiercely defending Kamala Harris in her campaign for president, accusing the Republicans of throwing \"everything they can\" at her.\n\nWhen asked about the 'diversity hire' criticism Ms Harris has recieved, Ms Warren said: \"Here's the scariest part to the Republicans, she can win on November 5. They're gonna say everything they can, but the reality is that's what the American people are going to see.\"\n\nDonald Trump's campaign has filed a challenge to block Kamala Harris from transferring $91 million (\u00a370 million) of campaign funds from what used to be the joint Biden-Harris war chest.\n\nIn a complaint filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission, Trump's legal team accused the vice-president of \"committing the largest campaign finance violation in American history\" by fraudulently grabbing another candidate's funds to launch her own presidential campaign.\n\nAfter President Biden abandoned his re-election bid on Sunday and endorsed Ms Harris to replace him at the top of the ticket, he began the process of transferring millions of dollars to her.\n\nThe Trump campaign argued that Ms Harris is \"seeking to perpetrate a $91.5 million dollar heist of Joe Biden's leftover campaign cash\" and branded it a \"brazen money grab\".\n\nMs Harris' representatives called the legal challenge \"baseless\", arguing that the campaign had Biden-Harris on it from the beginning so the funds could be used by either name on the ticket.\n\nKamala Harris' campaign has announced that since Tuesday evening it has raised $126 million (\u00a398 million) since Joe Biden bowed out of the race and officially endorsed her.\n\nThe $126 million includes $81 million donated in just the first 24 hours - largest one-day fundraising haul for any candidate ever, according to the campaign.\n\nThe contributions have come from 1.4 million donors, 64 per cent of which were making their first donations of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nKamala Harris positioned herself as the champion of middle class America and accused Donald Trump of wanting to take the country backwards in her first campaign rally on Tuesday night in Wisconsin.\n\n\"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead, a future where no child has to grow up in poverty, where every worker has the freedom to join a union,\" she said in front of cheering crowds.\n\nShe added: \"But Donald Trump wants to take our country backward. Him and his extreme 2025 agenda will weaken the middle class. We know we got to take that seriously...\n\n\"Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It's 900 pages.\"\n\nKamala Harris has reportedly narrowed down her choice of running mate to two candidates, Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania's governor, and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nBoth men have become frontrunners as the vice-president begins the vetting process to prepare for her probable nomination, according to ABC News, citing sources.\n\nMs Harris is said to have phoned Mr Shapiro on Sunday after she launched her presidential campaign. \"We spoke only about beating Donald Trump,\" the governor said on Monday.\n\nA Republican state senator has called for \"civil war\" if Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November.\n\nGeorge Lang, an Ohio politician, made the comment as he introduced JD Vance at his first solo campaign event since becoming Trump's running mate on Monday night.\n\nAfter taking to the stage fist-raised and shouting Trump's post-shooting battle cry \"Fight! Fight!\", Mr Lang warned of an existential threat facing Americans. He declared in front of a large, heated crowd in Ohio: \"We are in the fight for the soul of our nation... for our kids, for our grandkids, it is a fight we can never imagine.\n\n\"I believe wholeheartedly, Donald Trump and Butler County's JD Vance are the last chance to save our country. Politically, I'm afraid if we lose this one, it's going to take a civil war to save the country.\"\n\nRead more here.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will give what could be his final Oval Office speech at 8pm ET (1am BST) to explain why he dropped out of November's election and deny that he will spend six months as a lame duck.\n\nWith the world's eyes already on a looming clash between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Mr Biden will insist in his address to the nation that he still has work to do despite his historic decision to bow out.\n\nThe 81-year-old Democrat said on X he would discuss \"what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people\" in the primetime televised event.\n\nThe speech, expected to last eight to ten minutes, will be Mr Biden's first since stepping aside from the race on Sunday after weeks of pressure following a disastrous debate performance against Trump.\n\nIt comes just over a week since his last Oval Office address following an assassination attempt against Trump on July 13, but is only the fourth of his presidency overall - and could well be his last.\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\n\"In this campaign, I promise you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" the presumptive Democratic nominee said. \"We believe in a future where every person has the opportunity not just to get by, but to get ahead.\"\n\nMs Harris accused Trump of trying to \"take the country backward\", and asked: \"Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear and hate?\"\n\nMs Harris enumerated Trump's former scandals, involving fraud and sexual assault, saying she would \"proudly\" put her record in public office against Trump's any day of the week. \"I know Trump's type.\"\n\nThe vice-president arrived in Milwaukee for her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with President Biden's endorsement and shored up support from Democrat heavyweights and $100 million in new donations.\n\nBy stopping in Wisconsin, Harris was putting down a marker in one of the \"blue wall\" states along with Michigan and Pennsylvania that Democrats see as essential for securing a presidential victory.\n\nThe Secret Service has encouraged Donald Trump to stop organising large outdoor rallies and other outdoor events after the attempted assassination on the former president at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, agency officials urged Trump's campaign to move the events inside, people familiar with the matter told The Washington Post.\n\nThe Republican candidate's team is said to be scouting new venues, including basketball arenas, and has no current plans to stage a large outdoor event, a Trump aide said.\n\nDonald Trump has said Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, will visit him at his Florida estate on Friday.\n\nTrump made the announcement in a post on his social media network on Tuesday, saying: \"My PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH Agenda will demonstrate to the World that these horrible, deadly Wars, and violent Conflicts must end. Millions are dying, and Kamala Harris is in no way capable of stopping it.\"\n\nTrump originally posted that Mr Netanyahu would visit earlier in the week, but added an update saying that the Israeli leader had requested to change the meeting day from Thursday to Friday.\n\nCould there be a more pejorative, more misogynistic label to give a woman than \"childless cat lady\"? Those three little words convey volumes, not about the subject, but the person saying them.\n\nNo point pussy-footing about. If we didn't already know JD Vance, Donald Trump's pick for Republican vice president was a wrong 'un, here's the incontrovertible proof.\n\nA video, from back in 2021, has emerged showing Vance (a father of three, if anyone cares) referring to Democratic presidential nominee-in-waiting and mother-of-none Kamala Harris as \"one of the \"childless cat ladies\" who are \"miserable at their own lives\" and have \"no stake in the nation's future\".\n\nRead the full comment piece here.\n\nKamala Harris is more popular than Donald Trump, according to the first national poll carried out since Joe Biden stood down.\n\nResearch by Ipsos and Reuters published on Tuesday shows Ms Harris leads Trump by two points nationally, by 44 per cent of the vote to 42 per cent.\n\nA previous poll by the same firm previously found that Trump led Mr Biden by two points.\n\nThe survey suggests the Ms Harris, the now presumptive Democrat presidential nominee, has a fighting chance of overturning Trump's lead in the swing states ahead of the presidential election on November 5.\n\nWe're bringing you the latest updates from the US election.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Second Intifada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But Biden said while he draws strength in working for the American people, \"this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me.\"\n\n\"It's about you. Your families. Your futures,\" he said. \"It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden ended his campaign for a second term on Sunday after weeks of pressure from nervous Democrats and major donors, who feared he would lose to former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's withdrawal threw the presidential race into unchartered territory just four months before the election.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris quickly announced that she would run for president, and Biden offered her his endorsement. Harris has since raised more than $126 million for her nascent campaign and has already secured more than enough delegates to win the party's nomination.\n\nFull-blown crisis: An inside look at Biden campaign's pitfalls.\n\nIn the letter announcing his decision to pull out of the race, Biden said while it had always been his intention to run for a second term, \"I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nThe pressure on Biden to drop out started to build after a disastrous debate with Trump last month raised questions about his physical and mental acuity and his ability to serve another four-year term. But the White House insisted Monday, just a few hours before Biden's speech, that concerns about his health had nothing to do with his decision to exit the race.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden made it clear he plans to serve out the remainder of his term.\n\nBiden said he plans to spend the next six months doing his job as president - working to lower costs for families, growing the economy and defending personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\nHe said he would continue rallying a coalition of allies to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin from taking over Ukraine and would keep working to end the war in Gaza and bring peace to the Middle East.\n\n'A brave act': Americans react to President Biden's historic decision\n\nThe United States remains a nation of \"promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers.\"\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" he said. \"The people do.

He was determined to show that he would not act like a lame-duck president, outlining an ambitious agenda that underscored his resolve to continue building on his legacy.\n\nBiden did not mention Trump, his former Republican opponent, in his 10-minute Oval Office address -- but he didn't have to. The remarks were imbued with a deep sense of urgency about what the outgoing president saw as the stakes of the election.\n\nThe early part of his address sketched the choices that faces voters in November -- a contrast Biden himself had hoped to make during a reelection campaign that he ultimately decided he could not continue.\n\n\"Americans are going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,\" Biden said. \"We have to decide -- do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nThat last item -- democracy -- and defending it is \"more important than any title,\" Biden said.\n\nBiden outlined a hefty to-do list for his final months\n\nThe president says he's going to keep working over his final six months in office. He's seeking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad.\n\nHis to-do list was full of weighty issues. He said he'd work to end the war in Gaza, bring home the hostages and try \"to bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war.\" Biden meets Thursday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nHe's going to continue to work to lower costs for families and defend personal freedoms, keep calling out \"hate and extremism\" and push to end gun violence.\n\nHe also said he would continue to work on his initiative to end cancer as we know it and push for Supreme Court reforms.\n\n\"I'm going to keep working,\" he said.\n\nHe is willingly handing off power to a new generation\n\nBiden finally understood what Democrats had been telling him -- that it was time to hand off power to a younger generation -- and he embraced it, calling for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices\" in politics.\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" he said, even as he believed his presidency was deserving of a second term.\n\nFor months, Biden insisted that only he could go up against Trump and win. But that changed following his debate with Trump on June 27, when he spoke haltingly, lost his train of thought and failed to fact-check the former president's falsehoods. The performance raised a chorus of questions about his age and ability to do the job another four years and pushed Democrats to increasingly call for him to step aside. The standoff dragged for 24 days before Biden yielded, saying he needed to unify his party.\n\nThe tone and setting were solemn\n\nBiden is not a stranger to the sober address, delivering remarks on weighty matters such as the fate of democracy and voting rights at historically significant landmarks across the country and around the globe.\n\nBut Biden has used the formal trappings of an Oval Office address -- a tool used by presidents in times of national crisis or to capture a key moment in history -- sparsely, with Wednesday's speech marking just the fourth time that he has sat behind the Resolute Desk to speak directly to the nation.\n\nHis tone was solemn, the delivery careful and deliberate. He was surrounded by family and close aides as he gave an address willingly relinquishing power -- one that no politician wants to make.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule -- that people do,\" Biden said as he closed his address. \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden made a subtle push for his vice president\n\nIn the official setting of the Oval Office, Biden steered clear of overt political talk. But he still praised Vice President Kamala Harris as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" and gave a not-so-subtle push to voters.\n\n\"She's been an incredible partner for her leadership, for our country,\" he said. \"Now the choice is up to you, the American people. \"\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden posted a hand-written note after the president's speech thanking \"those who never wavered, who refused to doubt.\" She thanked supporters for putting their trust in the president. \"Now it's time to put that trust in Kamala.\"\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CRdrz2mT25jYDvcKMoxGNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/15acdc019df1c25d6373ed8f7da7d8b8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2835, "textEnd": 2842}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

I'm going to be working like hell, both as a sitting president, getting legislation passed, as well as -- and campaigning.\"\n\nThis Oval Office address, as well as any speech the president gives next month at the Democratic National Convention, will be among the most critical of not just Mr. Biden's presidency, but of his legacy, as he completes more than five decades in public service.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Based on a survey of DNC delegates conducted by The Associated Press, Harris has secured enough support to become the presumptive Democrat nominee.\n\nBiden's address marks the first time he's spoken to the nation since his decision. \"I revere this office but I love my country more,\" he said. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president but in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title.\"\n\n\"I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,\" he added. \"But this sacred task of perfecting our union, it's not about me.

I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term. But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden's comments about party unity refer to the fact that following his performance in last month's presidential debate with former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee for president, many in his own party began calling for him to drop out of the race because of concerns that the questions about his age and ability to serve as president, exacerbated by the debate performance, would cause him to lose the 2024 presidential election to Trump.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation, that's the best way to unite our nation,\" he said. \"There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices and that time and place is now.\"\n\nBiden vowed that \"over the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president.\" He specifically highlighted his intentions to \"lower costs for hardworking families, grow our economy,\" and \"defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights from the right to vote to the right to choose,\" referring to abortion.\n\n\"I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, making clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period,\" he promised. He also listed gun control, climate change, curing cancer and Supreme Court reform as top priorities of the remaining six months of his administration. He did not get into specifics on what he had in mind for Supreme Court reform, only characterizing the idea as \"critical to our democracy.\"\n\nBiden looked back on his time in office, expressing gratitude that \"we've come so far since my inauguration\" and \"we came together as Americans.\" He claimed that the U.S. became \"stronger, more prosperous and more secure\" under his leadership.\n\n\"I ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake, the very nature of who we are was at stake, and that's still the case,\" he proclaimed. \"America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant.\"\n\nBiden concluded his speech by praising Harris as an \"incredible partner to me\" and describing her as \"experienced,\" \"tough\" and \"capable.\"\n\nHe urged the American people to take the advice of Benjamin Franklin into consideration when voting in the 2024 presidential election, recalling how he emerged from the Constitutional Convention announcing that the newly formed nation would become \"a Republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\n\"Whether we keep our Republic is now in your hands,\" he declared. \"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States but here I am.\"\n\nBiden assured the American people he has \"given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" adding, \"I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you. ... The idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nWhile Biden did not explicitly mention Trump, his rhetoric reflected the line of attack that has become commonplace when discussing him either directly or indirectly. Although he praised Harris, he did not tell people directly to vote for her.\n\nBiden also did not directly address the more than 14 million Democrat primary voters who voted to make him the Democrat nominee. Concerns have emerged in the past few days that the push by party leaders and delegates to make Harris the nominee without letting Democrat voters weigh in amounts to effectively ignoring the will of the people as reflected in the primary results that demonstrated overwhelming support for Biden.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But I love my country more,\" the 81-year-old said in an elegiac prime-time address to the nation urging his divided country to embrace democracy and shun hatred.\n\n\"The defense of democracy, which is at stake, is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIn his first televised address since his stunning decision, Biden also hailed his Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, who is set to be the new Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"She experienced. She's tough. She's capable,\" Biden said in just the fourth address of his presidency from behind the Resolute Desk -- and likely his last.\n\nBiden bowed out of the race later than any other president in US history, giving in to weeks of pressure from Democrats after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump raised concerns about his age.\n\nSpeaking in a hushed voice after a Covid infection, Biden used the powerfully symbolic setting to insist on his achievements -- while admitting it was time to move on.\n\nHe said there was a \"time and a place for new voices, fresh voices -- yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nIn a sign of support for Biden after the toughest decision of his political life, most of his family sat watching him in the Oval Office as he spoke.\n\nThey included his wife Jill and daughter Ashley -- who held hands near the end of his remarks -- Biden's troubled son Hunter and a number of Biden's grandchildren.\n\nJill Biden later posted a letter on X thanking \"those who never wavered\" -- an apparent backhanded dig at the Democrats who called on Biden to quit -- and said it was \"time to put that trust in Kamala.\"\n\nBiden's withdrawal has upended Trump's campaign, which had previously focused on the president's age and mental acuity. Now it is Trump, 78, who is the oldest candidate in US history.\n\nTrump, who had initially called for unity after surviving an assassination attempt on July 13, was in no mood for magnanimity after Biden's speech.\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden's Oval Office speech was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\" Trump said on social media.\n\nRepublicans have called for Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.\n\nBiden however insisted that he was no lame duck and that he would continue to work on the economy and key foreign policy issues for the rest of his time in office.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said.\n\nOne key goal is a peace deal in the Middle East -- a legacy-defining dream that many US presidents before Biden have chased.\n\nBiden, who has been increasingly critical over Israel's war on Gaza, meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday.\n\nBut in a sign of how quickly things are changing, Netanyahu will sit down separately that day with Harris as well, as well as meeting Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe US election campaign meanwhile is moving ahead at full speed without Biden.\n\nIn his first rally since Harris secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee, Trump hit out at Harris as his \"new victim.\"\n\n\"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\" he said, accusing Harris of hiding Biden's \"mental unfitness.\"\n\nEarlier, the White House denied there was any \"cover up\" over Biden's condition.\n\nHarris was also on the campaign trail Wednesday, telling a Black college sorority in Indianapolis that \"I am fighting for our nation's future.\"",

Later in the day, a 15-year-old was arrested for assaulting a police officer in front of Union Station.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags, lit one ablaze and hoisted Palestinian flags in their place to massive cheers in the crowd.\n\nThree men were also arrested for assaulting a police officer and crossing a police line in Columbus Circle, outside Union Station, police said.\n\nBiden says he put party unity over a 'merited' second term\n\nDefending his tenure, Biden said his \"record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term.\" But, he said, \"I needed to unite my party.\"\n\nContrasting himself with Trump, he added, \"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nBiden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy chemical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's speech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib holds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not playing around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily membersof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000 protestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke toa roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But I love my country more,\" the 81-year-old said in an elegiac prime-time address to the nation urging his divided country to embrace democracy and shun hatred.\n\n\"The defense of democracy, which is at stake, is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIn his first televised address since his stunning decision, Biden also hailed his Vice President Kamala Harris, 59, who is set to be the new Democratic presidential nominee.\n\n\"She experienced it. She's tough. She's capable,\" Biden said in just the fourth address of his presidency from behind the Resolute Desk -- and likely his last.\n\nBiden bowed out of the race later than any other president in US history, giving in to weeks of pressure from Democrats after a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump raised concerns about his age.\n\nSpeaking in a hushed voice after a Covid infection, Biden used the powerfully symbolic setting to insist on his achievements -- while admitting it was time to move on.\n\nHe said there was a \"time and a place for new voices, fresh voices -- yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nIn a poignant sign of support for Biden after the toughest decision of his political life, most of his family sat watching him in the Oval Office as he spoke.\n\nThey included his wife Jill and daughter Ashley -- who held hands near the end of his remarks -- Biden's troubled son Hunter and a number of Biden's grandchildren.\n\nJill Biden later posted a letter on X thanking \"those who never wavered\" -- an apparent backhanded dig at the Democrats who called on Biden to quit -- and said it was \"time to put that trust in Kamala.\"\n\nBiden's withdrawal has upended Trump's campaign, which had previously focused on the president's age and mental acuity. Now it is Trump, 78, who is the oldest candidate in US history.\n\nTrump, who had initially called for unity after surviving an assassination attempt on July 13, was in no mood for magnanimity after Biden's speech.\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden's Oval Office speech was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\" Trump said on social media.\n\nRepublicans have called for Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.\n\nBiden however insisted that he was no lame duck and that he would continue to work on the economy and key foreign policy issues for the rest of his time in office.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said.\n\nOne key goal is a peace deal in the Middle East -- a legacy-defining dream that many US presidents before Biden have chased.\n\nBiden, who has been increasingly critical over Israel's military campaign in Gaza, meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday.\n\nBut in a sign of how quickly things are changing, Netanyahu will sit down separately that day with Harris as well, as well as meeting Trump in Florida on Friday.\n\nThe US election campaign meanwhile is moving ahead at full speed without Biden.\n\nIn his first rally since Harris secured enough delegates to become the de facto Democratic nominee, Trump hit out at Harris as his \"new victim.\"\n\n\"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\" he said, accusing Harris of hiding Biden's \"mental unfitness.\"\n\nEarlier, the White House denied there was any \"cover up\" over Biden's condition.\n\nHarris was also on the campaign trail Wednesday, telling a Black college sorority in Indianapolis that \"I am fighting for our nation's future.\"", "source": {"uri": "manilastandard.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Standard"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person",

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nMan who had himself banned from Iowa casinos wins jackpot at the Isle Chased out of Buchanan County, Balance music festival coming to Waterloo UPDATE: 69 John Deere Waterloo salaried employees let go Wednesday, 34 in Dubuque UPDATE: Man who died in lawnmower accident was Don Bosco teacher State: NewAldaya Lifescapes resident suffocated while trapped in bed rails Teen seriously injured in Dunkerton rollover crash Denver girls' track coach fired for unknown reason despite petition from community Name released in Hudson fatal shooting College Wrestling: UNI receives major gift toward new training facility Interstate traffic shut down for person on bridge Man arrested for knife threats at Waterloo apartment building John Deere will lay off an undetermined number of salaried workers beginning next week UPDATE: 15 year old injured in reported shooting 2024 Iowa Shrine Bowl: North squad downs South in offensive shootout Final work session for proposed merged high school covers athletics, traffic, boundaries\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nElections\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

In his remarks, though, he made clear he is not leaving the White House until his first term is done.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" Biden said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nBiden went on to condemn political violence and called for changes to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\n\"I'm the first president of this century to report that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world,\" Biden said. During Biden's administration, however, two major international wars have broken out: Russia invaded Ukraine and Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, prompting the Jewish nation to respond. Both wars are ongoing.\n\nBiden has endorsed Harris, who has already gathered Democratic donors, delegates and key endorsements. She is the presumed Democratic nominee and likely will face former President Donald Trump in November. Democrats will officially nominate their candidate at their convention in Chicago next month, but could do so beforehand in a virtual vote.\n\nBiden experienced a medical incident in recent days that the White House said was COVID-19. Biden was not seen over the weekend, raising concerns and questions, especially since Sunday's major announcement that he would drop out of the race was made via letter, not video or public remarks.\n\nIn the Sunday letter, though, Biden promised to give more details later in the week. Mostly, though, Biden spent Wednesday's address reminding Americans of his record and wins while in office.\n\nHe went on to praise Harris, calling her a great leader and warning Americans against voting for Trump, though never using his name.\n\nMore from this section Japan: Major Flooding After Severe Thunderstorm With Torrential Rain Hits Central Tokyo 2 Mexico: Heavy Rains Cause Chaos In Mexico City 5 New skyscraper resembles sassy leg pose\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,\" Biden said.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden continued. \"The people do.

Biden, who already faced ongoing questions about his mental fitness, had a disastrous debate with Trump at the end of June.\n\nAfter that debate, donors and elected Democrats began calling on Biden to leave the race, saying he could not beat Trump.\n\nA near-fatal assassination attempt against Trump further rallied support for the Republican presidential nominee, who was already leading Biden in national and most swing state polling.\n\nBiden refused for weeks to step aside as more and more Democrats called for him to leave the race, but over the weekend, he relented.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have continued to press Biden, arguing that if he is not fit to run for reelection, he is not fit to remain president.\n\n\"Does Lyin' Kamala Harris think Joe Biden is fit to run the U.S.A. for the next six months?\" Trump said in a statement. \"She must answer the question. Now it appears Joe is delegating his Presidential Authority to unelected Washington Bureaucrats! He doesn't even trust his Vice President. WHO IS RUNNING THE COUNTRY?\"\n\nTrump's Vice Presidential pick, U.S. Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, called on Biden to resign over the weekend.\n\n\"If Joe Biden ends his reelection campaign, how can he justify remaining President?\" Vance wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday. \"Not running for reelection would be a clear admission that President Trump was right all along about Biden not being mentally fit enough to serve as Commander-in-Chief. There is no middle ground.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@reformer.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "casey_harper@reformer.com", "name": "Casey Harper", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more: Politics Harris steps into the limelight.

It hasn't been done since 1968, when Lyndon Johnson announced he would not seek reelection in the heat of the Vietnam War.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" Biden said. \"But I love my country more.\"\n\nTrump, just an hour earlier at a campaign rally, revived his baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden. His refusal to concede inspired the Capitol insurrection of Jan. 6, 2021, which Biden called \"the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\"\n\nBiden skirted the political reality that brought him to that point: His abysmal performance in a debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks, sparked a crisis of confidence from Democrats. Lawmakers and ordinary voters questioned not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether, at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said, saying he wanted to make room for \"fresh voices, yes, younger voices.\"\n\nHe added, \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nIt was a belated fulfillment of his 2020 pledge to be a bridge to a new generation of leaders -- and a bow to the drumbeat of calls from within his party to step aside.\n\nBiden's address was carried live by the major broadcast and cable news networks. He spooled out an weighty to-do list for his last six months in office, pledging to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025. He said he would work to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, fight to boost government support to cure cancer and push for Supreme Court reform, among other things.\n\nThe president sought to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also making the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. But the way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, whom Biden praised as \"tough\" and \"capable,\" albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nBiden said he's grateful to have served as president -- nowhere else would a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation,\" he said. \"I've been blessed a million times in return.\"\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office before the election -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nTrump, who watched Biden's remarks from his private jet, posted on his social media platform that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nAs he spoke inside the Oval Office, Biden was joined off-camera by family members, including his wife, Jill, son Hunter, daughter Ashley and several grandchildren. Hundreds of administration aides held a watch party in the White House and gathered in the Rose Garden afterward to hear Biden thank them for their service. Outside the gates, supporters of Biden gathered holding signs that read \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nRead more: Government-politics Harris steps into the limelight.

There's also a time and a place for new voices fresh voices. Yes, younger voices,' he noted.\n\nOne thing he did not address was his own health. Biden, 81, just recovered from a bout of COVID but it was his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump, where he fumbled for words and stared blankly at times, that led mulitple Democrats to call for him to exit the presidential race.\n\nAs he spoke, his family was on the edge of the Oval Office: Jill Biden, Ashley Biden and husband Howard Krein, and Hunter Biden and his daughter Finnegan.\n\nAlso present were other Biden grandchildren including Naomi Biden Neal and her husband Peter Neal, young Hunter Biden (the late Beau Biden's son) and Maisy Biden.\n\nThe family broke into applause when the president was done speaking. Jill Biden joined him at the Resolute Desk. Hunter Biden gave his dad a hug.\n\nBiden fumbled a bit in his delivery, mumbling at times and speaking softly. But he used the address to outline his legacy, to explain his reasons for dropping out of the presidential race, and note he has more work to do in the six months he has left in office.\n\nHe said he revered the office but loves his country more.\n\n'I revere this office but I love my country more,' the president said.\n\n'It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president but the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than a title.'\n\nBiden made it clear he stepping down voluntarily, drawing a stark contrast between his predecessor. He didn't mention Donald Trump by name but his meaning was clear when he talked about how the country is more important than the Oval Office.\n\nTrump sought to overturn the 2020 election results and stay in power, later facing state and federal charges for his actions.\n\n'America is an idea - an idea stronger and any army, bigger than any ocean, more power than any dictator,' Biden said.\n\nAs the president spoke, his staff were gathered one floor up, on the state floor of the White House, to watch his remarks with wine and pizza.\n\nBefore the speech began, staffers were spotted walking in from the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, which is across the street of the West Wing, into the White House proper for the event.\n\nBiden's decision to step down sent shock waves through out the political world and closed out more than 50 years in politics.\n\nHe endorsed Harris to be his nominee and turned over his campaign infrastructure to her. The campaign renamed itself 'Harris for President.'\n\nWithin 30 hours Harris had pledges from enough delegates to win the presidential nomination.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday night, Biden didn't explicity endorse Harris but noted he's 'made my views known.\n\n'I made my choice. I've made my views known. I'd like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.'\n\n'Now the choice is up to you, the American people,' he said in reference to the upcoming election.\n\nDelegates will nominate their ticket virtually betewen August 1-7 ahead of the Democratic National Convention, which kicks off August 19th in Chicago.\n\nThe president returned to the White House on Tuesday after spending six days isolating in his Rehoboth Beach house, where he was suffering from COVID.\n\nHe has canceled a West Coast fundraising swing scheduled for the end of the week.\n\nHe will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Thursday.\n\nHe spent weeks rebuffing pressure from those in his party to step down as its nominee. On Sunday, he bowed to the inevitable.\n\nBiden is the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since 1968 when Lyndon Johnson, under fire for his handling of the Vietnam War, abruptly pulled out of the campaign on March 31.\n\nThe president also joins James K. Polk, James Buchanan, Rutherford B. Hayes, Calvin Coolidge and Harry Truman as presidents who all decided not to stand for a second elected term.\n\nMeanwhile, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday denied there was a 'coverup' of Biden's declining health and mental capabilities by the staff and Biden family members.\n\nBiden's top spokesperson was grilled repeatedly about Biden's apparent change of heart when it came to a second term and denied his health had anything to do with the decision.\n\nDuring her press briefing - the first since Biden's historic decision to step down as the Democratic nominee - Fox News' Peter Doocy asked her: 'It would seem that people in this White House knew that President Biden was slipping and it was hidden from the American people - so who ordered White House officials to coverup a declining president?'\n\n'There's been no coverup,' she replied.\n\nFor weeks Jean-Pierre and other aides denied Biden was considering leaving the presidential race. For months, they denied reports his health was on the decline. But, on the June 26th presidential debate, Biden repeatedly fumbled for words and froze on camera, leading to questions from his own party about his ability to serve a secod term in the White House. On Sunday, Biden announced he was stepping down as the party's nominee.\n\nShe said the president made his decision in 'very short period of time.'\n\nJean-Pierre pushed back against reports that aides, lawmakers and Democratic officials had noticed for months that Biden was on the decline.\n\nShe also said his health was not a factor in his decision to exit the presidential race.\n\n'It has nothing to do with his health,' she said. 'I can say, no, that's not the reason.'\n\nShe also called calls for the president to resign from office 'ridiculous.'\n\nThere have been questions as to why, if Biden can't serve four more years, he can serve six more months.\n\nJean-Pierre argued that Biden was capable of serving out a full second term.\n\n'He didn't step down from from campaigning or from running because he didn't believe he can serve in a second term. That is not why,' she said.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beau Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Krein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard Krein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Executive_Office_Building", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eisenhower Executive Office Building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_K._Polk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James K.

He has endorsed Kamala Harris, his vice-president, for the Democratic nomination ahead of this year's presidential election.\n\nMr Biden said: \"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term.\"\n\n\"But nothing, nothing, can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\n\n\"So I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation as the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nMr Biden had faced weeks of criticism from senior members of his own party, who argued his age and health would prevent him from beating Donald Trump for a second time in November.\n\nHe was resistant to calls from some of his closest allies, including Nancy Pelosi, for him to step down, before he posted a letter on X, formerly Twitter, announcing he was suspending his campaign. He then endorsed Ms Harris to replace him.\n\n\"The defence of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people,\" he said on Wednesday night.\n\n\"But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nSurrounded by photographs of his family in the Oval Office, Mr Biden quoted both the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence during his short address. He did not take any questions.\n\nHe also laid out a series of his achievements in office, including his flagship \"Bidenomics\" policies, crime reduction and his appointment of the first black woman as a justice of the Supreme Court.\n\nMr Biden did not refer specifically to Trump, who eroded his lead in swing states before his decision to stand down, but stressed that he had decided to quit the race because of threats to American democracy. He has previously referred to Trump as a \"dictator\".\n\n\"We're all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness,\" he said.\n\n\"We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either.\n\n\"And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now. In just a few months, the American people choose the course of America's future.\"\n\nMr Biden ended his remarks by thanking the public for giving \"a kid with a stutter\" the opportunity to serve as president.\n\nHe said: \"Here I am. That's what's so special about America. We're a nation of promise and possibilities of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.\"\n\nMr Biden's address came after Ms Harris's second speech since she became the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party earlier on Wednesday.\n\nShe has received the support of enough delegates to the Democratic National Convention to be awarded the nomination. The vast majority of delegates were previously allocated to Mr Biden after the party's primary race earlier this year.\n\nMr Biden promised to continue his work as president until January, when he will be replaced by the winner of this year's election. Some Republicans have called for him to stand down immediately.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. \"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hardworking families, [to] grow our economy.\n\n\"I'll keep defending our personal freedoms in our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\n\"I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, [and] make it clear there is no place in America for political violence, or any violence, ever.\"\n\n01:48 AM BST\n\nThat's all for today.\n\nThanks for following the Telegraph's live blog. We'll back tomorrow with the latest updates on the US election.\n\n01:14 AM BST\n\n'Dictators don't rule America'\n\nMr Biden said: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\n01:13 AM BST\n\nBiden: Harris 'tough and capable'\n\nMr Biden praised Kamala Harris for being \"experienced, tough and capable,\" and said that when voters cast their ballots in November they should remember the words of Benjamin Franklin that America is a \"Republic, if you can keep it\".\n\nHe added: \"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this country for 50 years of my life.\"\n\n01:10 AM BST\n\n'Soul of America at stake'\n\nMr Biden said: \"I ran for preisdent four years ago because I believe the soul of America is at stake...and that's still the case.\"\n\n01:08 AM BST\n\nBiden to focus on 'doing job'\n\nMr Biden said: \"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as President. That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote - to the right to choose.\"\n\nHe also said he would focus on ending gun violence, developments in cancer research, and ending US involvement in wars around the globe.\n\n01:05 AM BST\n\nBiden hands over to 'new generation'\n\nMr Biden said that \"nothing, nothing\" could stand in the way of \"saving our democracy, adding: \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\n01:05 AM BST\n\nBiden: choice between 'hope and hate'\n\nMr Biden said America was at a crossroads and \"has to choose\" between \"hope and hate\".\n\n01:03 AM BST\n\nBiden begins address to nation\n\nJoe Biden has begun his address to the American people from the Oval Office.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the US president said: \"The defense of democracy is more important than any title.

Ronald L Rowe Jr. replaced her as acting director.\n\n12:22 AM BST\n\nTrump: Harris 'covered up' Biden's 'mental unfitness'\n\nTrump claimed that Democratic Party bosses were behind Mr Biden's decision to step down and accused Ms Harris of covering up the US president's \"mental unfitness.\"\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the White House denied it had covered up any possible decline in Biden's health prior to his decision to drop out of the election race.\n\n12:20 AM BST\n\nHarris 'liberal driving force' behind Biden\n\nTrump called Ms Harris \"the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.\"\n\nHe claimed that she wanted \"abortions in the eighth and ninth month of pregnancy\" as well as \"right up until birth and even after birth, the execution of a baby.\"\n\n12:15 AM BST\n\nTrump: Harris wants to 'execute' babies\n\nDonald Trump claimed Kamala Harris was in favor of the \"execution\" of babies due to her stance on abortions, adding: \"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country.\"\n\n\"We're not going to let that happen,\" he told the crowd in North Carolina.\n\n12:04 AM BST\n\nTrump attacks Harris at rally\n\nDonald Trump unleashed a series of attacks on Kamala Harris in his first campaign rally since Joe Biden dropped out of the race.\n\nAppearing in Charlotte, North Carolina, a battleground state that carries 16 electoral college votes, Mr Trump dubbed the Vice President \"Lyin' Kamala\", a description he first levelled at Republican Senator Ted Cruz during the 2016 GOP primary.\n\nReports suggest the Trump campaign has been scrambling on how to respond since Mr Biden announced at the weekend he was dropping out of the race. Polls suggest the 59-year-old Ms Harris could be more competitive in several states than Mr Biden, not because she is 20 year younger than Trump.\n\n\"Lyin' Kamala is most left wing politician in the country,\" Trump said.\n\n\"She's absolutely terrible. She's, as you know, more liberal than Bernie Sanders. Can you believe it? She's rated far more liberal than Bernie. She's now trying to get rid of her record, but you can't.\"\n\nMs Harris has previously hit back at Trump, referencing her time at Attorney General of California and suggesting she had dealt with people like the former president, who earlier this year became the US president convicted of a crime.\n\nThe former president's trip to North Carolina suggested he is still concerned about keeping it in his column this November, even as his team reaches for wins in traditionally Democratic-leaning states like Minnesota, which Trump is set to visit on Saturday.\n\nThe last Democrat to win North Carolina was Barack Obama in 2008. But Ms Harris's supporters believe the state could be in play, especially if she picks Governor Roy Cooper as her running mate.\n\n11:51 PM BST\n\nTrump: Harris more Left than Sanders\n\nDonald Trump said \"lyin' Kamala\" is the most left wing politician in America, more so than Bernie Sanders.\n\n11:41 PM BST\n\nTrump: 'Lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nDonald Trump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\n11:31 PM BST\n\nTrump calls Harris 'radical left lunatic'\n\nDonald Trump accused Kamala Harris of being a \"radical left lunatic\" Wednesday, in his first rally since she became the de facto Democratic Party nominee in the White House race.\n\n\"She is a radical left lunatic who will destroy our country,\" the former president and Republican nominee claimed, calling her \"the ultra liberal driving force behind every single Biden catastrophe.\"\n\n11:13 PM BST\n\nWatch: Harris' full Indianapolis speech\n\n11:00 PM BST\n\nBiden to address 'what lies ahead'\n\nJoe Biden said on X he would discuss \"what lies ahead, and how I will finish the job for the American people\" in his televised speech Wednesday night.\n\nThe US president returned to the White House on Tuesday after spending nearly a week with Covid at his Delaware beach home, a period of isolation in which he took the decision to step back from the presidential race.\n\nRepublicans have called for Mr Biden to step down altogether, saying that if he is not fit to stand for reelection then he is not fit to serve as president.\n\nA White House spokesman dismissed that as \"ridiculous\" and maintained that Mr Biden is no \"lame duck.\"\n\n10:42 PM BST\n\nWhite House: Biden stepping down 'not a cover up'\n\nPresident Joe Biden stunned the world when he announced Sunday that he would not seek reelection, bowing to weeks of pressure after a disastrous, stumbling debate performance against Trump last month.\n\nThe veteran Democrat will tonight deliver his first speech since bowing out of the presidential race, using the powerfully symbolic setting of the Oval Office to try to restore some dignity as the clock ticks on his presidency and a half-century in public service.\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, White House press secretary, told reporters Wednesday that Mr Biden's decision has \"nothing to do with his health.\"\n\nShe denied that the White House had covered up any possible decline in Biden's condition. \"It is not a cover up. I know that is the narrative that you all want. It is not,\" she said.\n\n10:32 PM BST\n\nIsrael 'not seeking to resettle Gaza'\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu told US lawmakers on Wednesday that Israel does not seek to resettle Gaza and that after the war with Hamas the enclave should be led by Palestinians who do not seek to destroy his country.\n\nSpeaking to a joint meeting of Congress, the Israeli prime minister said that for the foreseeable future, however, Israel would need overriding security control of Gaza.\n\n10:23 PM BST\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the Donald Trump speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\n10:02 PM BST\n\nPictured: Gaza protest outside Congress\n\n09:44 PM BST\n\nNetanyahu's speech 'made for GOP'\n\nJamie Raskin, a Democrat representative from Maryland, said Benjamin Netanyahu's speech was made for Donald Trump's GOP.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral ceasefire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\n\n09:16 PM BST\n\nHamas responds to Netanyahu's speech\n\nHamas has responded to Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in the US congress calling for a new alliance in the Middle East by labelling Muslims who join it \"treasonous\".\n\nSami Abu Zuhri, a senior Hamas official, told Reuters on Wednesday that an alliance with Mr Netanyahu from any party is a \"treason to the blood of martyrs\".\n\nIn his speech addressing the US Congress earlier on Wednesday, Mr Netanyahu said the US and Israel can forge a security alliance in the Middle East to counter an Iranian \"threat\", saying that all countries which will make peace with Israel should join such an alliance.\n\n08:56 PM BST\n\nPictured: Pro-Palestinian protesters burn American flag and Netanyahu effigy\n\nAt Union Station, protesters have removed American flags from the building and set them alight, while burning an effigy of Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSome protesters climbed a flag pole and chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged a person away.\n\nAt least two people were seen being treated for the effect of chemical agents to the eyes.\n\n08:52 PM BST\n\nProtests break out in Washington\n\nThousands of people protesting Israel's war in Gaza are marching in Washington chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as they filled blocks of city streets.\n\nPolice used pepper spray on demonstrators while Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress.\n\nDemonstrators calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians marched toward the Capitol but were blocked by police from getting closer to the building.\n\nDemonstrators rallied near the Capitol before marching toward the building ahead of Mr Netanyahu's address to the joint session of Congress.\n\nAfter blocking a nearby intersection, protesters chanted, \"Shut it down!\" as they marched behind a banner that said \"globalize the student intifada.\"\n\n\"Bibi, Bibi, We're not done! The intifada has just begun!\" they shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. Other protesters chanted, \"Netanyahu, you can't hide.

And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Mr Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\n08:09 PM BST\n\nGaza needs to be 'deradicalised'\n\nThe Israeli prime minister called Wednesday for a demilitarized and deradicalized post-war Gaza, laying out his vision for the narrow coastal territory devastated by nine months of war.\n\n\"Following our victory, with the help of regional partners, the demilitarization and deradicalization of Gaza can also lead to a future of security, prosperity and peace. That's my vision for Gaza,\" Mr Netanyahu told US lawmakers.\n\n08:06 PM BST\n\nUS should 'fast-track' military aid\n\nMr Netanyahu called on the US to fast-track military aid to his country to help end the war in Gaza, after previously accusing Washington of holding up assistance.\n\n\"I deeply appreciate America's support, including in this current war. But this is an exceptional moment. Fast-tracking US military aid could dramatically expedite an end to the war in Gaza and help prevent a broader war in the Middle East,\" Mr Netanyahu told the US Congress.\n\n08:03 PM BST\n\nICC prosecutor pushing 'blood libel'\n\nThe Israeli leader said accusations that Israel was causing a famine in Gaza were akin to an anti-Semitic \"blood libel\".\n\n\"Don't be fooled when the blood libels against the Jewish state come from people who wear fancy silk robes and speak in lofty tones about law and justice,\" he said.\n\nMr Netanyahu cited the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court accusing Israel of deliberately starving Gazans as a \"case in point\".\n\nMr Netanyahu said this was a \"complete fabrication\" and that Israel had \"enabled\" 40,000 aid trucks, or half a million tonnes of food, to enter into Gaza since the war began.\n\n\"That's more than 3,000 calories for every man, woman and child in Gaza. If there are Palestinians in Gaza who are not getting enough food, it's not because Israel are blocking it, it's because Hamas is stealing it.\"\n\n07:55 PM BST\n\nSlander intended to 'demonise' Jews\n\nMr Netanyahu said: \"The outrageous slanders that paint Israel as racist and genocidal are meant to delegitimise Israel, to demonise the Jewish state and to demonise Jews everywhere.\n\n\"And no wonder we've witnessed an appalling rise in anti-Semitism in America and around the world. My friends, whenever and wherever we see the scourge of anti-Semitism we must unequivocally condemn it and resolutely fight it, without exceptions.\"\n\n07:49 PM BST\n\nNetanyahu: Jews slandered for centuries\n\nMr Netanyahu added: \"We (Jews) were accused of everything from poisoning wells, spreading plagues, to using the blood of children to bake Passover matzahs (bread).

For centuries the massacre of Jews was always preceded by wild accusations.\"\n\n07:41 PM BST\n\n'Gays for Gaza is chickens for KFC'\n\nMr Netanyahu added: \"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza. They might as well hold up signs saying chickens for KFC.\"\n\n07:40 PM BST\n\nProtestors Iran's 'useful idiots'\n\nMr Netanyahu said US anti-Israel protestors were \"Iran's useful idiots\".\n\nHe said: \"For all we know Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests outside this building...Well I have a message for these protestors: when the tyrants of Tehran who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\n07:37 PM BST\n\nProtestors 'burn flags even on 4th July'\n\nThe Israeli prime minister said: \"These protestors burn American flags even on the fourth of July.

They (Iran) want to disrupt America.\"\n\n07:33 PM BST\n\nPotestors should be 'ashamed'\n\nHe said anti-Israel \"protestors should be ashamed of themselves\" for \"standing with\" Hamas.

That includes personal ambition,\" Biden said in the Oval Office.\n\n\"So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices - yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nRelated: 'Capable' Harris and Biden's legacy: key takeaways from the president's address\n\nThe speech came three days after Biden stunned the country with the announcement he would abandon his presidential campaign less than four months before election day. As he contemplated the legacy of his five decades in public life, Biden pledged to keep working to better Americans' lives as he concludes his first - and now only - term as president. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested Biden should resign rather than finish out his term, but the president firmly rejected those calls on Wednesday.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said. \"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard-working families [and] grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nBiden specifically vowed to \"keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East\". Hours before Biden's speech, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, delivered a divisive address to a rare joint session of Congress in which he called for \"total victory\" in the war.\n\nBiden cited his own leadership on foreign policy, including his staunch support for Ukraine amid its war against Russia, as one of his proudest accomplishments. He reminded voters about the legislation he has signed to tackle the climate crisis, reduce gun violence and expand healthcare access. Harkening back to the day of his inauguration in 2021, weeks after the January 6 attack on the Capitol and less than a year into the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Biden marveled at how far the country had come in such a short time.\n\n\"We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the civil war,\" Biden said. \"We came together as Americans. We got through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous and more secure.\"\n\nAfter withdrawing from the race on Sunday, Biden endorsed his vice-president Kamala Harris, who has already consolidated the support of enough delegates to capture the Democratic nomination next month. In his speech, Biden reiterated his praise of Harris and underscored the immense choice facing voters this November.\n\n\"I'd like to thank our great vice-president, Kamala Harris,\" Biden said. \"She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\"\n\nBefore Biden's announcement on Sunday, more than 30 Democratic members of Congress had called on the president to drop out of the race following his disastrous debate performance last month. In the days leading up to the announcement, polls showed an increasing number of Democrats believed Biden should step aside as Donald Trump's narrow lead in the race began to grow.\n\nEarly surveys taken since Sunday suggest a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris, but the vice-president already appears to be in a slightly stronger position than Biden was. Even as polls indicate a tight race, Biden expressed confidence that Americans would choose to preserve democracy this November. Quoting the Declaration of Independence and founding father Benjamin Franklin, Biden made the time-honored argument for American exceptionalism.\n\n\"America is an idea, an idea stronger than any army, bigger than any ocean, more powerful than any dictator or tyrant. It's the most powerful idea in the history of the world,\" Biden said. \"That idea is that we hold these truths to be self-evident. We're all created equal, endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights: life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. We've never fully lived up to it, to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either, and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\"\n\nIt was a message that echoed Biden's campaign slogan in 2020, which framed the election against Trump as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". That battle remains ongoing, Biden said, and it will now be up to the American people to decide how it will end.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do,\" Biden said. \"History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith - keep the faith - and remember who we are.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_session_of_the_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joint session of the United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices and that time and place is now.\"\n\nHowever, Biden strangely offered no explanation as to why he dropped out of the race suddenly, even though the few weeks prior, the president consistently declared that he had no intention of dropping out.\n\nBiden went on reiterate his endorsement for Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign. Harris recently acquired enough delegate support to become the presumptive Democrat nominee for president.\n\n\"Now, in just a few months, the American people choose the course of America's future,\" the president said.\n\n\"I made my choice,\" Biden continued. \"I made my views known.

During an Oval Office address, he mentioned that the decision was driven by internal polling and his love for the country. Biden will focus on his job for the remaining six months.\n\nPresident Joe Biden announced on Wednesday that he is \"passing the torch to a new generation\" by stepping out of the 2024 presidential race. The announcement came during an Oval Office address, marking the first time Biden spoke to Americans about his sudden decision to leave the race.\n\nBiden, 81, faced weeks of pressure from Democrats to step aside after a poor debate performance on June 27. Only \"the Lord Almighty\" could convince him to go, Biden had said, but he ultimately decided that passing the torch was the best way to unite the nation.\n\nAfter days of soul-searching and reviewing internal polling that indicated he could lose to Republican Donald Trump, Biden revealed his decision. He emphasized that in America, the people rule, not kings or dictators, and the idea of America lies in the people's hands. This marks Biden's first major public address since he announced his decision not to seek reelection via social media on Sunday.\n\nBiden, the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon Johnson in 1968, joins the ranks of presidents who chose not to stand for a second elected term. Despite calls for him to step down due to mental acuity concerns, Democrats have rallied around Biden, honoring his character and record as president.\n\nAlthough the White House has denied any cognitive issues, Biden will focus on his duties for the remaining six months of his term. He plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday to discuss a Gaza ceasefire. Biden's political career began in 1972 when he became one of the youngest U.S. senators at age 29 and will end with him as the oldest American president at age 82 on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nBiden reaffirmed his commitment to democracy, stating that the task of perfecting the Union is about the people, not individual titles or positions. \"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures.

But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks.

The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLake Powell reaches highest level in more than 3 years Furniture and electronics store closing Tucson locations 46-year-old man shot to death at east side Tucson gas station Buyers of Ram diesel pickups were defrauded, Arizona attorney general says Storm damage seeds debate about Tucson's tree choices Court rejects requiring citizenship proof for some AZ voters in presidential race Two Democrats vie in primary for Pima County treasurer nomination Tucson Sen.

But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

The move has upended the already unprecedented race and thrust Vice President Kamala Harris into the spotlight as the Democratic party's heir apparent to take on Trump in November.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Biden's 11-minute speech:\n\nBiden did not mention Trump during his address, but the themes that have dominated his campaign against the former president were dominant in his speech.\n\n\"The defence of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and I find joy in working for the American people, but this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you, your families, your futures,\" he said.\n\nHe added the US was at an \"inflection point\" and that the upcoming months will \"determine the fate of our nation and the world\".\n\n\"We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy? In this moment, we can see those we disagree with, not as enemies, but as fellow Americans. Can we do that?\"\n\nBiden made only glancing reference to the concerns over his age that crescendoed ahead of his withdrawal from the presidential race. He said he was departing from the race to help heal the wounds in the Democratic Party and unite Democrats in the goal of winning.\n\n\"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,\" he said. \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nHe added that \"there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life\" but that \"there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now\".\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,\" he said.\n\nBiden took a moment to thank Harris, who he has endorsed to be the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"I've made my choice,\" he said. \"She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable,\" he said of Harris. \"She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\"\n\nHe said it would be up to Americans to make the choice come November.\n\nIn an apparent rebut of Republican calls to resign, Biden said he will spend the rest of his term \"focused on doing my job as President\".\n\nHe spent a considerable portion of the speech listing off policy initiatives of his administration, including efforts to boost the economy, build infrastructure, protect civil rights, restore ties with international allies, and to counter gun violence.\n\nHe called his time as president \"privilege of my life\".\n\n\"Nowhere on earth could a kid with a stutter from the modest beginnings of Scranton, Pennsylvania, Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the resolute desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States,\" he said.\n\nBiden's speech was met with praise from his allies, but not everyone in his party may find the address satisfying.\n\nThe president offered little in the way of greater clarity of what ultimately inspired him to leave the race so late into the election season, after previously saying only the \"Lord almighty\" could convince him to step aside.\n\nHe also did not address segments of the party who have criticised the late decision for largely preventing other possible Democratic candidates from mounting meaningful bids for the party's ticket.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claymont,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claymont, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Claymont, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24207037728641-1721869906.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden and other Democrats consistently argue that former President Donald Trump, who refused to concede after he lost the 2020 election to Biden, is a threat to democracy.\n\nFollow live updates on Biden's speech here\n\nThe speech, which comes three days after he dropped his bid, is the beginning of Biden's efforts to shape his legacy following a disastrous debate performance in late June that left members of his own party calling for him to step off the campaign trail and allow another candidate to run against Trump. Many Democrats believed Biden's bumbling debate performance and halting push to clean it up made his path to re-election impossible.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,\" Biden plans to say in remarks scheduled to begin shortly after 8 p.m. ET. Though he will not seek a second term, he will remain in office.\n\nAt a campaign rally in North Carolina on Wednesday night, Trump went after his former opponent. \"Three days ago, we officially defeated the worst president in the history of our country, crooked Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\nBiden abandoned his re-election campaign early Sunday afternoon, announcing the decision in a post on X that he followed about half an hour later with an endorsement of his vice president, Kamala Harris, for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nShe quickly consolidated support from within their party and is expected to win a virtual roll call of Democratic delegates -- perhaps without opposition -- as early as Aug. 1 and no later than Aug. 7.\n\nIn leaving the nomination to Harris, Biden became the first eligible incumbent to cede his party's presidential nod since Lyndon Johnson in 1968. That was two years before Biden first ran for office in Delaware, a New Castle County Council seat that he won.\n\nTwo years later, at age 29, he defeated Republican Sen. Caleb Boggs in a tightly contested campaign. Biden would win six more terms in the Senate -- where he was chairman of the Judiciary and Foreign Relations committees at different times -- with the last victory coming the same year, 2008, he was elected vice president. Along with President Barack Obama, Biden won re-election as vice president in 2012. He came out of retirement to defeat a crowded field of rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 and ultimately beat Trump that November.\n\nHis decision to retire rather than remain on the 2024 ballot means he will finish his career undefeated in general elections -- though he ran and lost in presidential primaries in 1988 and 2008. It also brings to an end a career focused on the presidency. Biden first contemplated running for the Oval Office in the first election in which he was old enough -- 1980 -- and at least considered bids in most of the years when no Democratic incumbent was on the ballot.\n\nOnce regarded as a centrist within his party, Biden won support from progressives in Congress early on in his administration. He and his Democratic allies credit him with enacting the most sweeping domestic agenda since the Johnson administration -- a claim that is hard to measure and with which critics take issue.\n\nNo matter the metric, Biden signed into law major measures with profound effects on the country, including a nearly $2 trillion Covid-relief measure, a trillion-dollar infrastructure package and a bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act that included significant provisions aimed at controlling climate change.\n\nIn addition to putting Harris -- the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American person to be vice president -- on his ticket, he appointed Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman confirmed to the Supreme Court.\n\nBiden plans to say Wednesday night that he will pursue a similar path until a new president is sworn in Jan. 20.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as President,\" he plans to say. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights -- from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nHe is also expected to nod to what he sees as the danger of a second Trump presidency in an implicit call for Americans to reject his longtime rival.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" he plans to say. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

But perhaps none were as somber and reflective as the one President Joe Biden delivered on Wednesday night, just days after announcing his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.\n\nSitting at the Resolute Desk, where many Presidents before him had addressed the nation in times of crisis and decision, Biden attempted to cement his legacy as a leader who prioritized the defense of democracy over personal ambition. \"I revere this office but I love my country more,\" the President said of his decision to drop out of the race, as his wife Jill Biden and several family members watched from inside the room. \"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your President. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\n\"I believe my record as President, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term,\" he continued. \"But nothing -- nothing -- can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition. The best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nRead More: Why Joe Biden Dropped Out\n\nThe primetime speech marked Biden's first public comments since passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is expected to be the Democratic Party's nominee for President. Biden's withdrawal came on the heels of a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump last month, where he appeared frail and struggled to articulate his positions effectively. The debate, widely seen as a turning point, exposed vulnerabilities and concerns about his age that had been simmering since his initial run against Trump in 2020.\n\nBiden, 81, explained his decision to suddenly abandon his reelection bid after insisting that he would remain in the race, declaring that it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. \"There's a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" he said. \"There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nHe praised Harris and urged voters to pick her over Trump in the November election, describing his 59-year-old Vice President as \"experienced,\" \"tough,\" and \"capable\" and declaring that democracy is at risk in this election.\n\nRead More: How Harris Is Pivoting From Biden's Campaign Message\n\n\"The idea of America lies in your hands,\" Biden said as he alluded to the weight of the office and asserted that the character of a President still matters. \"In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American Presidents,\" he said in the beginning of his speech. \"Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us Presidents are not kings.\"\n\n\"I ran for President four years ago because I believed and still do that the soul of America was at stake,\" Biden added, never mentioning former President Trump by name. \"The very nature of who we are was at stake. That is still the case.\"\n\nIn response to Biden's address, Trump took to social media to criticize his delivery, calling the President \"barely understandable\" and \"sooo bad.\" Biden stumbled over a few words, but the speech did not feature significant errors.\n\nBiden reflected on his decadeslong public service career and lauded the American system of government that allowed him to rise to the pinnacle of power, starting with his election to the Senate in 1973. Despite challenges and setbacks, including criticisms of his debate performance, Biden used his speech to list his accomplishments as President, including efforts to combat climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. He also laid out his priorities for the final months of his presidency, focusing mostly on foreign policy. Biden vowed to strengthen NATO in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and said he would \"keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all hostages, and bring peace and security to the Middle East.\"\n\nHe also said he hopes to make more progress on the Cancer Moonshot, an initiative he launched in 2016 to cure the disease that killed his son Beau and millions of Americans, and pledged to push for Supreme Court ethics reforms during his final months in office.\n\n\"It's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation over 50 years,\" Biden said. \"Nowhere else on earth could a kid with a stutter -- from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware -- one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTwo dead following Sunday night two-vehicle accident in Sioux City's westside Woodbury County Court Report for July 22, 2024 Specialty dog boutique store, Urban Mutts, opens in Sioux City BNSF Railway wants to remove collapsed Big Sioux River train bridge One dead after early Saturday morning collision in Sioux City Jason's Frozen Treats open second dine-in ice cream parlor Sioux City substitute teachers to receive extra pay for outside of normal day work UPDATED: Okoboji lakes fall below target for lifting boat speeding limits High school baseball: Bleeker's walk-off lifts Crusaders over Warriors in substate final Overnight fire closes Spirit Lake Walmart Iowa nursing home resident suffocated while trapped in bed rails, state says State seeks to use Dakota Dunes homicide suspect's confession at trial Marriage licenses for Woodbury County for July 23, 2024 River-Cade crowns 2024 Queen of the River and princesses in Sioux City ceremony There's no place like the stage, The New Stage Players presents the Wizard of Oz\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

This was the first speech Biden has made since he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday.\n\nMost notably, the 81-year-old president, who was recovering from Covid-19 this week, highlighted the importance of passing the torch to a new generation, referring to his endorsement for Kamala Harris as the new contender for November's elections.\n\nIn a roughly 10-minute speech, Biden pointed to the threat that he says Donald Trump poses to democracy in the US.\n\n\"When Ben Franklin was asked,\" Biden said, \"as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a Republic, Franklin's response was: a republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\n\"Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands,\" Biden said.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nBiden delivered a short, poignant speech focused on the weight of the office\n\nBiden started his speech on Wednesday by noting that he was sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. He then referenced former presidents who have held the office.\n\n\"In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents,\" he said in the beginning of his speech. \"Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings.\"\n\nBiden questioned, notably, if the character of a president still matters, and without naming Donald Trump, asked voters to question whether the Republican nominee would uphold the sanctity of the presidency or US democracy.\n\nHe passed the torch to Kamala Harris and expressed his support\n\nIn the much-awaited address, Biden explained his decision to withdraw his re-election campaign. \"This sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it's about you,\" Biden said, and then turned the focus to his vice-president, who is now the most likely Democratic nominee.\n\nBiden commended Harris for her work, calling her an \"experienced\", \"tough\" and \"capable\" candidate. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,\" he said. Biden had endorsed Harris soon after his announcement on Sunday.\n\nBiden reminded people of his legacy and his plans to call for supreme court reform\n\nBiden said that over the next six months, he will focus on \"lowering costs\", growing the economy, and fighting against gun violence and the climate crisis. He also said that he will call for a supreme court reform, calling it \"critical to our democracy\".\n\n\"I'll keep fighting for my cancer moonshot,\" he said, referring to his efforts to find a cure for cancer that began years before his presidency.\n\nHe ended on a personal message to his voters. \"I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am,\" Biden said. \"History is in your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Speech_Synthesis", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Speech Synthesis", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Tool_Kits", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Tool Kits", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Research", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_the_guardian_uk_429/eac8fbe6f5082191a9df2766d9744f6b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The president on Sunday announced that he would no longer be seeking the Democratic nomination, endorsing the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris a short time later on the same day.\n\nDuring his address on Wednesday night, Biden said that he dropped out of the race to \"pass the torch to a new generation,\" regardless of his own \"personal ambition\" to win and serve out a second term. The president said that the likely election between Harris and Trump would be a choice \"between moving forward or backward.\"\n\n\"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union -- it's not about me, it's about you, your futures ... Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, that includes personal ambition.\"\n\n\"I've decided that the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" he continued. That's the best way to unite our nation ... There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nThe president then outlined plans for the final months of his term as president, indicating that he has no intention of stepping down.\n\n\"Over the next six months I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" Biden said. \"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hardworking families and grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\n\n\"I'll keep calling out hate and extremism,\" he continued. \"Making clear that there is no place, no place in America for political violence. Or any violence, ever. Period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, or planet from climate crisis.\"\n\nBiden went on to say that he would \"keep fighting for my cancer moonshot\" to \"end cancer as we know it\" and to call for \"critical\" Supreme Court reform during his final months. He also said that he would be working on several foreign policy goals, including bringing \"peace and security\" to the Middle East and ending Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"I'll keep working to make sure America remains strong, secure and the leader of the free world,\" he added. \"We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and make it more powerful and more united than any time in our history.\"\n\nRepublican critics of Biden have been calling for the president to resign from office in the days since he announced he would no longer be facing Trump, claiming without any clear evidence that he had resigned due to failing health and that Harris and his staff had been involved in efforts to conceal his condition.\n\nIn a statement posted to social media on Sunday, Biden said that it was \"the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President\" but exiting the race was \"in the best interest\" of the Democratic Party and the country.

It feels like a lifetime of news has happened since then.\n\nAt that event, the media grilled Biden about his horrible performance at the June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the end of the press conference, Biden was asked this question: \"If your team came back and showed you data that she [Vice President Kamala Harris] would fare better against former President Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race?\n\nAnd Biden answered in his weird whisper: \"No, unless they came back and said, 'There's no way you can win.' Me. No one is saying that. No poll says that.\"\n\nHow quickly times change.\n\nSince then, Trump faced an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania; the Republican National Convention officially nominating Trump took place in Milwaukee; and Biden got COVID.\n\nOh, and on Sunday, Biden dropped out of the presidential race via a letter on social media.\n\nDemocrats were warned: Conservatives told the truth about Biden. Democrats failed to listen.\n\nThe American people deserved a better explanation, much sooner\n\nBiden told the country that it has been the \"honor of my life to serve as your president,\" but he said he has also realized that it's time to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nNo incumbent president since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 has decided not to seek re-election, and Biden waited much longer to make his choice. We're less than a month from the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nHow did Biden go from being so adamant that he'd soldier on with his campaign to believing \"it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" as he wrote in his letter Sunday?\n\nBiden didn't offer a good explanation in his Wednesday address.\n\nHis illness, along with his sudden decision to abandon the presidential race, spurred all kinds of unfounded rumors, with people wondering if Biden had been hospitalized or worse. Biden wasn't seen publicly for nearly a week until he left his home Tuesday in Delaware.\n\nAnd Americans' uncertainty about the condition of their president is on Biden for not making a formal announcement much sooner.\n\nAmericans needed to hear from him directly right away.\n\nBiden's health raises questions: What did Kamala Harris know about Biden's deteriorating health? And when did she know it?\n\nIs this what preserving democracy looks like?\n\nBiden spent much of his brief Oval Office remarks defending his record and what he's done, and how he plans to spend his remaining months in office.\n\nAs he usually does, Biden reiterated how this election is all about preserving and defending our democracy.\n\nYet, Biden did not give an adequate rationale as to why he waited so long to make his decision. By doing so now, so late in the game, he denied Democrats a true primary in which they could have picked from a robust crop of candidates.\n\nInstead, they appear stuck with Harris, whom no one voted for in the primaries. She has quickly become a media darling and star fundraiser now that the party has rallied around her. At 59, she is decades younger than Biden, 81 - and Trump, 78 - but she doesn't bring much else to the table.\n\nBiden also refused to level with the American people about his health, even as he struggled to read at times from the teleprompter.\n\nThere are tumultuous times ahead in the coming months, and Biden did not offer any confidence that he's the one to lead us through them.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

Photograph: Evan Vucci/Pool via Reuters\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation. There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now,\" Biden said in his Oval Office address to the nation.\n\nThe much anticipated address to the nation came three days after he announced that he was withdrawing from the presidential race and endorsing his deputy Kamala Harris as the nominee for the Democratic Party.\n\nHarris, who is of Indian and African origin, has now emerged as the presumptive presidential nominee.\n\n\"I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine our fate of our nation and the world for decades to come,\" he said from the Oval Office.\n\nHe was surrounded by the First Lady, Dr Jill Biden, son Hunter Biden and several members of his family. Toward the end of remarks, Ashley Biden reached for the hand of her mother, Jill Biden, who was seated next to her.\n\nAfter the president concluded his remarks, Jill Biden walked to the Resolute Desk and stood next to her husband. \"This has been the honour of a lifetime,\" Biden said, followed by other words of gratitude.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris watched Biden's Address to the Nation from Houston, where she is spending the night after visiting the city's Emergency Operations Center to receive a briefing on the ongoing recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBiden in his remarks said that America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\n\n\"We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy. In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans,\" he said.\n\nOver the next six months, Biden said, he will be focused on doing his job as the president.\n\n\"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard working families, grow our economy, and I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights from the right to vote to the right to choose. I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis, is the existential threat,\" he said.\n\nBiden said he is the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world.\n\n\"We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I'll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific. You know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore. I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,\" said the president.\n\nBiden said in just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future.\n\n\"I made my choice.

But I love my country more,\" Biden said in a rare speech that marked the beginning of the closing chapter of his presidency and half-century in public service.\n\n\"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake - and is more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,\" he said.\n\nWhile Biden did not mention Donald Trump by name, he tried to draw a clear contrast with the former president, whose ambition led him to claim victory in an election he did not win four years ago.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden is no longer the presumptive Democratic nominee trying to convince the nation that he still has the stamina and faculties to take on Trump in an election in which he warned nothing less than democracy itself is in the balance. Instead, he's now a lame-duck, having thrown his political weight behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, after being convinced by fellow Democrats that he is politically incapable of seeking a second term in office.\n\nHis speech marked his first extensive remarks since his announcement Sunday that he was not running and served as the first time many Americans have seen him since he tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nDuring his speech, which lasted about 11 minutes, Biden worked to shape the first draft of his own legacy, heralding his first-term accomplishments while looking ahead to goals he hopes to achieve in his remaining months in power, including Supreme Court reform, ending the war in Gaza, upholding American alliances and working toward his cancer-ending moonshot.\n\nHe also championed his vice president, who's now taking his place on the ticket.\n\nHarris, Biden said, is \"experienced. She's tough. She's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me, and a leader for our country.\"\n\n\"Now the choice is up to you, the American people,\" he added.\n\nOval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements. It will be only the fourth time Biden has addressed the nation from the setting as president. And it's the second time in just 10 days, following Biden's remarks to the country earlier this month following the assassination attempt against Trump. He's also used the setting to speak about Hamas' attack on Israel last year and to laud the passage of a bipartisan budget agreement.\n\nBiden, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for Covid-19, began drafting his highly anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN.\n\nThe president and his longtime communications aide, Mike Donilon, began early work on the speech shortly after Biden went public with his decision to exit the race, after three weeks of mounting intraparty pressure. (Donilon, a former pollster, played an instrumental role in presenting the data that informed Biden's decision to step aside.)\n\nHarris, who quickly secured the backing of enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination, hit the campaign trail Tuesday in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, where she sought to draw a contrast with Trump. The former president held his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out in North Carolina on Wednesday. A CNN poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in the race between Harris and Trump, but it showed a closer contest than earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.\n\nThe new CNN poll finds voters widely supportive of both Biden's decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden's policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color.\n\nBiden himself is expected to turn his attention in the coming days and weeks to the legacy of his one-term presidency. But, as one source told CNN, with the decision to drop out of the 2024 race only days old, such discussions have not begun in earnest.\n\nBut on Wednesday, he took the opportunity to marvel at his own, uniquely American, life story.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as president of the United States.\"\n\n\"Here I am,\" he added. \"That's what's so special about America.\"\n\nCNN's Sam Fossum contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Donilon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Donilon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

His speech at 8 p.m. ET will be his first extensive remarks since his announcement Sunday that he was not running and will serve as the first time many Americans see him since he tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nThe president intends to use the prime-time remarks to reveal to the American people how he arrived at the painful decision, sources told CNN, which he said in his letter Sunday he believed was \"in the best interest of my party and the country.\"\n\nBiden will say his decision to drop out of the race and \"pass the torch\" to a younger generation was one he reached because he believes it will be \"the best way to unite our nation,\" according to excerpts of his remarks.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People,'\" Biden is expected to say.\n\nHe will add later: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nOval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements.

Like all of Biden's public speeches throughout his presidency, officials expect this address will be a work in progress up until delivery.\n\nHow much Biden focuses on what he views as his core achievements of his three-and-a-half years in the office he sought for several decades -- versus how much he details his to-do list for the six months before he leaves the White House -- was still being decided Monday night, officials said.\n\nThe president and his longtime communications aide, Mike Donilon, began early work on the speech shortly after Biden went public with his decision to exit the race, after three weeks of mounting intraparty pressure. (Donilon, a former pollster, played an instrumental role in presenting the data that informed Biden's decision to step aside.)\n\nHarris, who quickly secured the backing of enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination, hit the campaign trail Tuesday in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, where she sought to draw a contrast with Trump.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nNew business coming to Davenport's former Bed Bath & Beyond Deere held employee meeting Wednesday, no word yet on potential layoffs for Quad-Cities Two injured in shooting at NorthPark Mall in Davenport Monday Witnesses describe gunfire at NorthPark Mall that injured 2 Quad-Cities business openings: New furniture store coming to Davenport, other happenings Davenport code enforcement officer quits after argument with boss over Wold-owned duplex Teen arrested in relation to shooting at NorthPark Mall in Davenport Deere rolls back diversity, equity, inclusion initiatives after conservative backlash Several Davenport teens accused of gang crimes; police report group violence down overall Timeless Tickets: East Moline-raised rapper Torrian Ball remembers opening for Lil Durk in 2021 Second person dies after Friday house fire in Riverdale One injured in Scott County motorcycle crash Davenport developer pulls 16-unit central city development at Sixth and Sylvan Iowa nursing home resident suffocated while trapped in bed rails, state says One person found dead during Riverdale house fire early Friday morning\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

This was the first speech Biden has made since he announced his withdrawal from the race on Sunday.\n\nMost notably, the 81-year-old president, who was recovering from Covid-19 this week, highlighted the importance of passing the torch to a new generation, referring to his endorsement for Kamala Harris as the new contender for November's elections.\n\nIn a roughly 10-minute speech, Biden pointed to the threat that he says Donald Trump poses to democracy in the US.\n\n\"When Ben Franklin was asked,\" Biden said, \"as he emerged from the convention going on, whether the founders have given America a monarchy or a Republic, Franklin's response was: a republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\n\"Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands,\" Biden said.\n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\nBiden started his speech on Wednesday by noting that he was sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. He then referenced former presidents who have held the office.\n\n\"In this sacred space, I'm surrounded by portraits of extraordinary American presidents,\" he said in the beginning of his speech. \"Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings.\"\n\nBiden questioned, notably, if the character of a president still matters, and without naming Donald Trump, asked voters to question whether the Republican nominee would uphold the sanctity of the presidency or US democracy.\n\nIn the much-awaited address, Biden explained his decision to withdraw his re-election campaign. \"This sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me, it's about you,\" Biden said, and then turned the focus to his vice-president, who is now the most likely Democratic nominee.\n\nBiden commended Harris for her work, calling her an \"experienced\", \"tough\" and \"capable\" candidate. \"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,\" he said. Biden had endorsed Harris soon after his announcement on Sunday.\n\nBiden said that over the next six months, he will focus on \"lowering costs\", growing the economy, and fighting against gun violence and the climate crisis. He also said that he will call for a supreme court reform, calling it \"critical to our democracy\".\n\n\"I'll keep fighting for my cancer moonshot,\" he said, referring to his efforts to find a cure for cancer that began years before his presidency.\n\nHe ended on a personal message to his voters. \"I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am,\" Biden said. \"History is in your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/eac8fbe6f5082191a9df2766d9744f6b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nMan kills grizzly, hospitalized after encounter in Flathead National Forest UPDATED: Evacuations ordered for new Butler Creek wildfire; Red Flag Warning The Stables: New restaurant in downtown Missoula next to Cranky Sam Fire, reported explosions prompt Missoula officials to close Lions Park Forest Service aware of interested buyer for Holland Lake Lodge Missoula police urge caution after reported downtown sexual assaults Missoula looks to build sidewalks in Westside neighborhood to avoid gentrification USPS to suspend air service delivery in Montana in favor of ground transportation Fire restrictions for county, forests, reservation, as fires start and Miller Peak grows Miller Peak fire near Missoula barely grows ahead of Friday public meeting Fire danger extreme, restrictions ordered as Miller Peak blaze grows Man shot and killed by Mineral County officers was from Missoula NorthWestern monitoring Thursday's weather for possible rare power shutoff 1 dead after officer-involved shooting in Mineral County 3 Montana inmates die in Cascade County Detention Center in 2 weeks\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend.

He called his decision to drop out of the presidential race \"the \"right thing to do,\" CNN reported.\n\nBiden made the remarks during a phone call he made into his former campaign's headquarters to thank the staff and praise Kamala Harris, who visited the Wilmington office on Monday (local time) to visit with staff.\n\nDuring the phone call, Biden directly addressed Harris and the team, saying, \"embrace her, she's the best.\"\n\nOn his announcement to drop out of the presidential race, he called it \"suprising news\" and emphasised that it's his belief it was the \"right thing to do,\" CNN reported.\n\n\"I know it's hard because you poured your heart and soul into me,\" Biden told the campaign staffers and added, \"You're an amazing team.\"\n\nThe US President expressed gratitude to the staffers for uprooting their lives for him and his now ended campaign. He said that they have built the \"best\" campaign organisation in history. He said, \"I've been honoured and humbled.\"\n\nBiden said, \"I'm going to be on the road and I'm not going anywhere.\" He stated, \"I won't be on the ticket but I am still going to be fully, fully engaged. I've got six months left in my presidency. I'm determined to get as much done as I possibly can both foreign policy and domestic policy,\" according to CNN report.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Biden announced his decision to not seek re-election in the \"best interest\" of the Democratic Party and the country. He has endorsed US Vice President Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee for the Democratic Party and called on Democrats to \"come together and beat\" Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.\n\nIn a letter posted on X, Biden stated, \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.

It also gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nLincoln restaurant calls it quits after 15 years 'Ready to learn from this': John Cook updates Harper Murray's status for 2024 season 'Exhausting, heartbreaking, devastating': Racism at Wayne school pushes family out of Nebraska Former Nebraska Sen.

But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nBiden's candidacy faced a crisis of confidence from Democrats after his abysmal debate against Trump nearly a month ago, where he spoke haltingly, appeared ashen and failed to rebut his predecessor's attacks. It sparked a mutiny within his party over not just whether he was capable of beating Trump in November, but also whether at 81, he was still fit for the high-pressure job.\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said. \"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden's address was being carried by the major television news networks. He pledge to remain focused on being president until his term expires at noon on Jan. 20, 2025.\n\nThe president was hoping to use the address to outline the stakes in the election, which both Biden and Harris have framed as a choice between freedom and chaos, but was expected to try to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office or even mentioning Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden was also looking to make the case for his legacy of sweeping domestic legislation and the renewal of alliances abroad. The way history will remember his time in office and his historic decision to step aside is intertwined with Harris' electoral result in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nHis advisers say he intends to hold campaign events and fundraisers benefiting Harris, albeit at a far slower pace than if he had remained on the ballot himself.\n\nHarris advisers will ultimately have to decide how to deploy the president, whose popularity sagged as voters in both parties questioned his fitness for office.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nBiden, aides say, knows that if Harris loses, he'll be criticized for staying in the race too long and not giving her or another Democrat time to effectively mount a campaign against Trump. If she wins, she'll ensure his policy victories are secured and expanded, and he'll be remembered for a Washingtonian decision to step aside for the next generation of leadership.\n\nPress secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Wednesday that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\"\n\nJean-Pierre said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.\n\nRead more:\n\nGovernment-politics\n\nHarris steps into the limelight.

His tone was wistful and his speech was an early farewell.\n\n\"It's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,'' he said\n\nSitting behind the Resolute Desk and surrounded by photos of his family, Mr. Biden ticked through the accomplishments of his term, ranging from the choice of the first Black woman to be a Supreme Court justice to pulling the country out of a paralyzing pandemic. He expressed gratitude to the American people for allowing a \"kid with a stutter\" from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pa., to reach the pinnacle of American politics.\n\nJust beyond the camera, dozens of aides and several members of his family, including Jill Biden, the first lady, watched as Mr. Biden said he would walk away from the office they had worked to help him reach for decades.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" he said, \"but I love my country more.\"\n\nUltimately, Mr. Biden said, he concluded that \"the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\" The president praised Vice President Kamala Harris -- \"she's experienced, she's tough, she's capable\" -- but warned, as he has for years, that Americans faced a choice between preserving democracy and allowing it to backslide.\n\n\"History is in your hands,\" Mr. Biden said. \"The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. We just have to keep faith, keep the faith, and remember who we are.\"\n\nMr. Biden, who spent the first part of the week recovering from Covid at his beach house in Delaware, spoke with a rasp and slight slur in his voice, speaking sometimes haltingly as he promised that he would defend his legacy and do what he could to help Ms. Harris win the election against former President Donald J. Trump. He stared straight ahead into the camera and seldom blinked.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" Mr. Biden said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families, grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nThis speech was the fourth Oval Office address of Mr. Biden's presidency and the second just this month. Ten days ago, Mr. Biden urged Americans to lower the political temperature after a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania, wounding the former president and killing one of his supporters.\n\nOther than saying it was time to pass the torch to someone young, Mr. Biden offered no other reason for his decision to step down. He did not mention the three-week pressure campaign from his own party to get him out of the race after his faltering and at times incoherent debate performance with Mr. Trump in June 27.\n\nMr. Biden and his advisers, aides said, still believed that he had a path to victory, but that he had been unable to flip the focus from his debate showing back onto the policies espoused by Mr. Trump. His decision to turn the race over to Ms. Harris ultimately overrode some of his private concerns about her ability to be able to win in a general election.\n\nThe drafting of his Wednesday address began on Sunday after Mr. Biden made the decision to drop out. Mike Donilon, one of the president's senior aides, helped Mr. Biden fashion the remarks. Jon Meacham, the presidential historian, contributed to the speech, as well as Vinay Reddy, a White House speechwriter.\n\nMr. Biden now has six months to bolster a legacy that he is proud of but that gained little traction among Democratic voters, who had long registered their concerns in polls about his age and ability to do the job. Over the last three-and-a-half years, Mr. Biden worked to repair frayed relations with American allies in the West, passed a raft of landmark legislation and helped lead the country out of a crippling pandemic.\n\nBut Mr. Biden, a former senator who spent 36 years priding himself in his ability to find compromise on legislation, now has little hope to deliver on unfulfilled promises he has made on issues ranging from women's rights to voting protections.\n\nIn recent days, Ms. Harris has blazed onto the campaign trail, surfing a wave of hope and enthusiasm from Democratic voters that was absent during much of Mr. Biden's presidency. Though Mr. Biden has promised to campaign vigorously for the vice president, his schedule for next week remains relatively clear, beyond a trip to Austin on Monday to speak at the presidential library of President Lyndon B. Johnson -- the last Democratic president who decided not to seek re-election.\n\nMr. Biden is also facing heightened pressure from Republicans -- including Mr. Trump's new running mate, Senator JD Vance of Ohio -- who argue that he must resign if he does not think he would be able to serve a second term.\n\nIn a press briefing on Wednesday, Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Biden would not resign and, in fact, still believes that he would be able to fulfill his duties four years into a second term.\n\nHe did not say any of that in the Oval Office. Instead, he said repeatedly that he had put the good of the country before his political aspirations.\n\n\"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Mr. Biden said. \"That includes personal ambition.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scranton,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scranton, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Are Americans up to it? | John L. Micek", "body": "In just 11 minutes on Wednesday night, President Joe Biden framed his exit from the 2024 presidential campaign as a fight for the future -- and for a republic, if Americans can keep it.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said. \"I draw strength and find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People.'\"\n\nIt was Biden's first public appearance since dropping out of the race on Sunday. And one freighted with meaning.\n\nSpeaking from the Oval Office, the 81-year-old chief executive nodded to his predecessors who had been called upon to defend the union: George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" Biden said.\n\nHe explicitly passed the torch only days after he endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, to replace him and as Democrats surged to her banner.\n\n\"There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and a place for new voices,\" Biden said. \"Fresh voices? Yes. Younger voices. And that time and place is now.\"\n\nHarris, 59, of California, is \"experienced,\" \"tough\" and \"capable,\" Biden said.\n\nStill, as he looked forward, Biden looked back, recounting his accomplishments in office, marveling that a \"kid with a stutter\" who came from humble beginnings in northeastern Pennsylvania and Delaware could ascend to the highest elected office in the country.\n\nAll of it was a vintage Joe Biden performance.\n\nBut it took a while to get here -- perhaps too long for some Democrats, and for those thousands of Americans who were dreading his rematch with former President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd it was not without its moments of pain and awkwardness.\n\nDemocrats exerted increasing pressure on Biden to exit the race after his faltering debate performance against Trump in Atlanta last month. Biden, in return, dug in, insisting he would not leave.\n\nThe calls grew louder over the ensuing weeks. They temporarily went quiet in the hours after Trump, now the Republicans' presidential nominee, survived an attempted assassination during a rally in Western Pennsylvania two weeks ago.\n\nBut on Sunday, gradually and then suddenly, as they say, Biden was out of the race.\n\nYou could almost hear the collective exhale from Democrats as they effectively delivered Harris the nomination, and filled her campaign coffers with more than $100 million in contributions.\n\nThere have been some, over the last few days, who have compared Biden's decision to exit the race to Washington's announcement in 1796 that he would not seek a third term, positioning it as an act of heroic self-sacrifice.\n\nIt's a nice sentiment that falls a little short of the mark.\n\nWashington, forever a reluctant leader, left office by choice. Biden had been running for the White House his entire life.\n\nIn truth, the president's departure feels a bit more like a manager finally convincing a fading veteran pitcher to leave the mound after he's stayed in the game an inning or two too long.\n\nStill, listening to Biden on Wednesday night, it was clear that the standard set by the nation's first president, who warned against factionalism at home, was on his mind, as he took a thinly veiled swipe at Trump.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said, without mentioning the competition by name. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nThough some Republicans have called on him to resign and leave office early, Biden has shown no such inclination. And on Wednesday, he sketched his priorities for his last six months in office.\n\nHe ticked off a list that included continuing his efforts to lower drug prices, protect abortion rights, fight gun violence and push for a \"cancer moonshot.\" He also called for Supreme Court reform.\n\nBiden ended his brief remarks the way he began them -- indeed, much the way he has spent his presidency -- calling on Americans to heed their better angels and to work together.\n\n\"Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands,\" Biden said. \"Let's act together to preserve our democracy.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

But he eventually caved, particularly after hearing from congressional leadership, who implored him to drop out or risk Democrats also losing both chambers of Congress in November.\n\n\"In recent weeks it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor,\" he said.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So, I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" the president added.\n\n\"The cause of the nation is larger than any one of us,\" he said.\n\nHe was joined in the Oval Office by first lady Jill Biden, his children, their spouses and children and some of his longtime political advisers along with White House staff.\n\nBiden has thrown his support behind Vice President Harris who Democrats say has revitalized their energy and has potential to boost their chances at beating former President Trump. Harris watched Biden's speech from Houston, Texas, according to reporters traveling with her.\n\nIn a letter posted to social media on Sunday, Biden announced he would drop his bid. It came after reports suggested that some of the highest-profile Democrats, including former President Obama and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif) had tried to convince him his chances of winning against Trump were disappearing.\n\n\"There is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" Biden said in his address. \"There's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time is now.\"\n\nThe calls for him to step aside followed a poor debate performance in late June, during which Biden, 81, struggled to finish his thoughts and spoke in a low, raspy voice. He spent three weeks insisting he was staying in the race and campaigning up until he dropped out.\n\nThe president in his address made a plea for preserving democracy, which was an ongoing theme of his administration, after he beat Trump in 2020.\n\n\"In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies but as... friends, fellow Americans.

The idea of America lies in your hands,\" Biden added.\n\nHe made clear he would not be stepping down from the office of the presidency and will serve out his term for the next six months.\n\nThe president outlined his plans until he leaves office in January, which includes ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Supreme Court reform, and continuing to work for reproductive rights and his Cancer Moonshot initiative, among other priorities.\n\nHe also touted Harris, calling her \"experienced,\" \"tough,\" and \"capable.\" The president never mentioned Trump by name.\n\nAdditionally, he expressed gratitude for the 50 years he has served in government.\n\n\"No one else on Earth can a kid with a shutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office,\" Biden said. \"I've given my heart and my soul to the nation, like so many others...

The latter was joined by his wife, Melissa Biden, while the president's daughter, Ashley, was also present alongside husband Howard Krein. The president's granddaughter, Finnegan, was seen wiping away a tear after Biden had concluded his remarks and stood up to embrace his family.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as President,\" Biden added.

Toward the end of remarks, Ashley Biden reached for the hand of her mother, Jill Biden, who was seated next to her.\n\nAfter the president concluded his remarks, Jill Biden walked to the Resolute Desk and stood next to her husband. \"This has been the honor of a lifetime,\" Biden said, followed by other words of gratitude.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris watched Biden's Address to the Nation from Houston, where she is spending the night after visiting the city's Emergency Operations Center to receive a briefing on the ongoing recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl.\n\nBiden in his remarks said that America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division.\n\n\"We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy. In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies, but as fellow Americans,\" he said.\n\nOver the next six months, Biden said, he will be focused on doing his job as the president.\n\n\"That means I'll continue to lower costs for hard working families, grow our economy, and I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights from the right to vote to the right to choose. I'll keep calling out hate and extremism, make it clear there is no place, no place in America for political violence or any violence ever, period. I'm going to keep speaking out to protect our kids from gun violence, our planet from climate crisis, is the existential threat,\" he said.\n\nBiden said he is the first president in this century to report to the American people that the United States is not at war anywhere in the world.\n\n\"We'll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We'll keep NATO stronger, and I'll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history,\" he said.\n\n\"I'll keep doing the same for allies in the Pacific. You know, when I came to office, the conventional wisdom was that China would inevitably surpass the United States. That's not the case anymore. I'm going to keep working to end the war in Gaza, bring home all the hostages and bring peace and security to the Middle East and end this war,\" said the president.\n\nBiden said in just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future.\n\n\"I made my choice.

That is the best way to unite our nation,\" Biden said from behind the storied Resolute Desk. \"The defense of democracy ... I think it's more important than any title.\n\n\"It's about 'We the people.' We can never forget that and I never have,\" the 81-year-old president added, his voice still raspy after a bout with COVID-19. \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\nWithout naming former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, Biden appeared to issue a warning about him to American voters, who will head to the ballot box in just over four months.\n\n\"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition,\" he said. \"The great thing about America is ... kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. ... George Washington showed us that presidents are not kings.\n\n\"Whether we keep the republic is now in your hands,\" Biden said, pointing into the television camera. \"I've given my heart and my soul for our country,\" he added, calling himself \"grateful.\"\n\nWhile he did not directly address concerns about his age, Biden did say it was time to pass the torch to \"fresh voices, and yes, younger voices.\"\n\nNational and swing-state polls had shown Biden losing ground to Trump in recent weeks, and he had said in one interview that \"data\" and his higher power were the only two things that could force him from the race. But big-money donors said they were withholding contributions to his campaign and late last week threatened to cut off Democratic congressional candidates.\n\nAmong the issues Biden vowed to work on during his last months in office was \"Supreme Court reform,\" but he did not offer any specific policy proposals.\n\nBiden ran in 2020 on unifying the country amid the COVID-19 pandemic and after four years of Trump's brash style and hard-line policies, which offended Democrats. But a variety of forces hindered that lofty goal as Republicans simultaneously cast him as the leader of a corrupt family and crooked political operation -- and too senile and frail for his office.\n\nHis presidency also was hamstrung by needing to bring the pandemic to an end; skyrocketing interest rates; high prices of food, gasoline and other everyday items; then wars in Ukraine and Gaza that followed a chaotic and violent U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that he green-lighted. Team Biden's messaging about what Democrats still call legislative and policy accomplishments never resonated with voters -- and his low poll numbers showed it.\n\n\"I draw strength, and find joy, in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union is not about me,\" he said. \"It's about you. Your families. Your futures.\"\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, earlier Wednesday described a scenario that played out over 24 historic hours over last weekend, culminating in the release of a letter from Biden announcing he would end his campaign. Shortly after that, Biden endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris, who has since secured enough delegates for next month's Democratic convention to become the party's nominee.\n\n\"He met with a small group of advisers on Saturday evening and with his family,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters. \"Sunday afternoon, he made that decision.\"\n\nRepublicans, who finished their party convention last week feeling they had momentum against a sagging rival party, reacted to Biden's decision by accusing Democrats of covering up the president's infirmity, and some called on Biden to resign immediately.\n\nJean-Pierre rejected questions suggesting White House aides withheld information from the public and press about his health and cognitive state. \"There's been no cover-up,\" she told a Fox News reporter before declining to answer his question about whether Biden feels like Democratic lawmakers \"stabbed him in the back\" by calling for his departure.\n\n\"The president is going to continue to do what he set out to do [over] the next six months ... building on the accomplishments he was able to get done,\" she said.\n\nBiden said that during his remaining time in office he will focus on working to \"continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights - from the right to vote - to the right to choose.\" He also cited unspecified efforts to lower health care costs.\n\nBiden made a \"personal, difficult decision,\" Jean-Pierre said, adding, \"The president has no regrets.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollcall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Roll Call"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_t_bennett@rollcall.com", "name": "John T.

We're the United States of America, and there is nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.\"\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \"America is an idea . . . the most powerful idea in the history of the world: We hold these truths to be self evident. We're all created equal . . . we've never fully lived up to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either, and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\"\n\n\"Now the choice is up to the American people,\" he said. \"When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin . . . asked whether the Founders have given Americans a monarchy or a republic, his answer was, 'a Republic, if you can keep it.' \"\n\nRelated: Joe Biden Addresses Presidential Debate Performance: 'Don't Speak as Smoothly as I Used to'\n\nIn announcing he was leaving the 2024 race on July 21, Biden said, \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President.

And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee for our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nRelated: Biden-Harris Campaign Officially Retitled 'Harris for President' After Joe Biden Exits Presidential Race\n\nIn her own statement, Harris said she was \"honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\" Harris stated. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\"\n\n\"We have 107 days until Election Day,\" she concluded. \"Together, we will fight.

[Not Nancy Pelosi's threat that \"we can do this the easy way or the hard way\" because he was losing big in the polls].\n\nBiden delivered his speech in the Oval Office while his son Hunter Biden, Hunter's daughter Finnegan Biden, Biden's daughter Ashley Biden, Ashley's husband Howard Krein, and Jill Biden sat nearby and listened solemnly.\n\n\"This sacred task of protecting our union is not about me, it's about you, your families, your futures. It's about 'we the people,'\" Biden intoned. \"I've made it clear that I believe America as at an inflection point, one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now will determine the fate of our nation and the world to decades to come,\" he said.\n\nIn a throwback to his 2020 campaign rhetoric, Biden continued: \"America's going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy*.\"\n\nInsisting he would \"always level with\" the American people and tell the truth, Biden tried to explain why he stepped down from the presidential race without admitting that it was health-related, or due to his massive unpopularity.\n\n\"In recent weeks, it's become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor,\" he said.\n\nJean Pierre told skeptical reporters earlier Wednesday that Biden believed he could serve another four years, and in his speech, Wednesday night, Biden indicated that he thought he deserved a second term.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term, but nothing -- nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy -- that includes personal ambition,\" Biden said.\n\nWithout explaining why, he asserted that the time to \"pass the torch\" to a new generation was now.\n\n\"You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. But there's also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now,\" he said.\n\nBiden went on to outline what he hopes to achieve in his remaining six months in office, citing a long litany of left-wing policies he would continue to push, including \"the right to vote and the right to choose.\" And he vowed to keep speaking out against \"hate and extremism,\" \"gun violence\" and the existential threat of \"climate crisis.\"\n\nBiden also said he would keep fighting for his Cancer Moonshot boondoggle that was launched in 2016 when he was vice president \"so we can end cancer as we know it.\"\n\nAnd he ominously added, \"I'm going to call for Supreme Court reform because this is critical to out democracy.\"\n\nBiden went on to assert that he ran for president four years ago because he believed \"the soul of America was at stake,\" and claimed that is still the case.\n\nHe concluded his speech without taking any questions from the media.\n\n*When Democrats say \"Democracy,\" they mean their hold on power.", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri": "debra_heine@amgreatness.com", "name": "Debra Heine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Krein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Howard Krein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

It's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now,\" Biden said.\n\nThe speech lasted roughly 11 minutes, with the president sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office while touting his years in political office and decision to bow out. Members of the president's family were in attendance for the speech, including first lady Jill Biden, daughter Ashley Biden, son Hunter Biden and others.\n\nThe president said he looks forward to the work before him in his final six months in office, including pushing for Supreme Court reforms.\n\n\"I'm gonna call for Supreme Court reform, because this is critical to our democracy,\" he said. Media reports recently surfaced that Biden is considering supporting legislation that would attempt to impose term limits on Supreme Court justices and a new enforceable ethics code.\n\nBiden announced his exit from the presidential race on Sunday evening in an X post while self-isolating in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, following a COVID-19 diagnosis last Wednesday. After suffering \"mild symptoms\" and \"general malaise\" after his diagnosis, he received a negative diagnosis on Tuesday of this week and returned to the White House.\n\nHis trip back to the nation's capital on Tuesday marked the first time Biden was seen in public since suspending his re-election bid on Sunday and the first time since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on July 17.\n\nHis speech Wednesday evening included citing American forefathers and political leaders while arguing \"democracy is at stake\" this election cycle as the Democratic Party squares up against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear. I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president, but in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union, it's not about me. It's about you.\"\n\nTrump responded to the speech on Truth Social, saying it was \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nThe 46th president had faced mounting pressure from his Democrat allies and legacy media outlets to bow out of the race since June 27, when he delivered a botched debate performance against Trump that was riddled with garbled remarks and where the president lost his train of thought and appeared more subdued than during other recent public events.\n\nThe debate reignited concern among conservatives and critics that Biden's mental acuity had slipped, while it marked the beginning of a pressure campaign among Democrats to oust Biden in favor of a candidate they believed is better suited to take on Trump.\n\nNow that the president has dropped out of the election cycle, conservative lawmakers and others have called on Biden to resign from the White House, arguing that if he is unable to run for re-election, he's unfit to run the nation for the roughly six months left of his tenure.\n\n\"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nOthers have called on Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment while concerns mount over Biden's health. Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles sent a letter to Harris on Thursday requesting she invoke the 25th Amendment, exclusively telling Fox News Digital that Biden left the race \"because he isn't up for the job of president, and everyone in America knows it.\"\n\n\"I've said for over a year that Biden's ever-declining health has rendered him incapable of leading the nation. With his recent reclusion following a supposed COVID diagnosis, it is now more apparent than ever that he must resign or be forced out. Since Biden has made it clear he will not resign, it is imperative that Vice President Harris move forward with invoking the provisions of the 25th Amendment to remove him forcibly. The safety and well-being of the American people and our nation depend upon it,\" Ogles said.\n\nBiden's announcement on dropping out was made just more than a week after an assassination attempt on Trump's life during a rally in Pennsylvania and just days after the Republican National Convention wrapped up in Milwaukee, where Trump was officially declared to be the Republican Party's nominee.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

It's about 'We the People.' \"\n\n\"I gave my heart and my soul to our nation,\" Biden said. \"I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\"\n\nBiden's speech comes three days after the 81-year-old president quit the race against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and threw his full support behind Harris.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said.\n\n\"That is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nBiden, without mentioning Trump by name, nodded to the threat he believes the Republican represents to the United States if he is elected in November.\n\n\"I ran for president four years ago because I believed and still do, that the soul of America was a stake,\" said Biden, who defeated Trump in 2020. \"The very nature of who we are was a stake. And that's still the case.\"\n\nBiden, who plans to serve out the remainder of his first term, which ends in January, returned to Washington on Tuesday after several days of isolating at his Delaware beach house, recovering from Covid-19.\n\nBiden's decision to exit the race on Sunday during that Covid quarantine came after a weeks-long pressure campaign from Democratic lawmakers, donors and strategists calling on him to step aside after his stumbling June debate performance against Trump.\n\nThe debate fumble escalated lingering concerns regarding Biden's age and fitness to wage a successful campaign against Trump, much less complete a second presidential term.\n\nSince Sunday, the Biden-turned-Harris campaign has been in a honeymoon phase.\n\nHarris has secured the endorsements of hundreds of Democratic lawmakers and governing officials, including those who were previously floated as potential contenders to replace Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nThose names have now been ruled out as potential Harris challengers and instead are on the list to become her running mate.\n\nHarris has also raked in record levels of donations online and from high-dollar donors. Her first several campaign rallies have seen more attendees than any the campaign has seen this election cycle. And she is starting to catch up to Trump in the polls, according to initial voter surveys.\n\nBiden in his speech Wednesday gave his vice president another full-throated endorsement\n\n\"I made my choice. I made my views known. I'd like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris,\" he said. \"She experienced. She's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me. And the leader for our country. Now, the choice is up to you, the American people. \"\n\nBiden then reminded Americans about their power in the election.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" the president said.\n\n\"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soul music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarantine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/07/108011507-17218661352024-07-25t000729z_785519338_rc2029ap0jxx_rtrmadp_0_usa-election-biden.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

It's the best way to unite our nation. You know, there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There's also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now,\" Biden said.\n\nThe speech lasted roughly 11 minutes, with the president sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office while touting his years in political office and decision to bow out. Members of the president's family were in attendance for the speech, including first lady Jill Biden, daughter Ashley Biden, son Hunter Biden and others.\n\nThe president said he looks forward to the work before him in his final six months in office, including pushing for Supreme Court reforms.\n\n\"I'm gonna call for Supreme Court reform, because this is critical to our democracy,\" he said. Media reports recently surfaced that Biden is considering supporting legislation that would attempt to impose term limits on Supreme Court justices and a new enforceable ethics code.\n\nBIDEN ENDS BID FOR 2ND TERM IN WHITE HOUSE AS HE DROPS OUT OF HIS 2024 REMATCH WITH TRUMP\n\nBiden announced his exit from the presidential race on Sunday evening in an X post while self-isolating in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, following a COVID-19 diagnosis last Wednesday. After suffering \"mild symptoms\" and \"general malaise\" after his diagnosis, he received a negative diagnosis on Tuesday of this week and returned to the White House.\n\nHis trip back to the nation's capital on Tuesday marked the first time Biden was seen in public since suspending his re-election bid on Sunday and the first time since being diagnosed with COVID-19 on July 17.\n\nHis speech Wednesday evening included citing American forefathers and political leaders while arguing \"democracy is at stake\" this election cycle as the Democratic Party squares up against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Thomas Jefferson wrote the immortal words that guide this nation. George Washington showed us presidents are not kings. Abraham Lincoln implored us to reject malice. Franklin Roosevelt, who inspired us to reject fear. I revere this office, but I love my country more,\" he said.\n\n\"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president, but in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our union, it's not about me. It's about you.\"\n\nGOP SENATOR DEMANDS CABINET INVOKE 25TH AMENDMENT AGAINST BIDEN AFTER SUSPENDING HIS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN\n\nTrump responded to the speech on Truth Social, saying it was \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nThe 46th president had faced mounting pressure from his Democrat allies and legacy media outlets to bow out of the race since June 27, when he delivered a botched debate performance against Trump that was riddled with garbled remarks and where the president lost his train of thought and appeared more subdued than during other recent public events.\n\nThe debate reignited concern among conservatives and critics that Biden's mental acuity had slipped, while it marked the beginning of a pressure campaign among Democrats to oust Biden in favor of a candidate they believed is better suited to take on Trump.\n\nTRUMP SAYS BIDEN 'IS NOT FIT TO SERVE': 'WHO IS GOING TO BE RUNNING THE COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT 5 MONTHS?'\n\nDozens of members of Congress began publicly thanking Biden for his work in the White House and decades in public office while calling on him to pass the torch to another candidate.\n\nShortly after his announcement on Sunday afternoon, Biden endorsed Vice President Harris to pick up the mantle and make a run for the party's nomination. As of Tuesday, Harris had enough delegates to lock up the nomination, which will be certified by the DNC next month.\n\nHe added in his speech Wednesday that Harris is \"tough\" and \"capable\" while touting her as the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee.\n\n\"I'd like to thank our great Vice President Kamala Harris. She's experienced. She's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people,\" he said.\n\n10 DEMOCRATS VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS COULD NAME AS HER 2024 RUNNING MATE\n\nNow that the president has dropped out of the election cycle, conservative lawmakers and others have called on Biden to resign from the White House, arguing that if he is unable to run for re-election, he's unfit to run the nation for the roughly six months left of his tenure.\n\n\"If Joe Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to serve as President. He must resign the office immediately. November 5 cannot arrive soon enough,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement on Sunday.\n\nOthers have called on Harris to invoke the 25th Amendment while concerns mount over Biden's health. Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles sent a letter to Harris on Thursday requesting she invoke the 25th Amendment, exclusively telling Fox News Digital that Biden left the race \"because he isn't up for the job of president, and everyone in America knows it.\"\n\n\"I've said for over a year that Biden's ever-declining health has rendered him incapable of leading the nation. With his recent reclusion following a supposed COVID diagnosis, it is now more apparent than ever that he must resign or be forced out. Since Biden has made it clear he will not resign, it is imperative that Vice President Harris move forward with invoking the provisions of the 25th Amendment to remove him forcibly. The safety and well-being of the American people and our nation depend upon it,\" Ogles said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBiden's announcement on dropping out was made just more than a week after an assassination attempt on Trump's life during a rally in Pennsylvania and just days after the Republican National Convention wrapped up in Milwaukee, where Trump was officially declared to be the Republican Party's nominee.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_colton@foxnews.com", "name": "Emma Colton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

Between hope and hate. Between unity and division. We have to decide, do we still believe in honesty and decency, respect, freedom and democracy.\"\n\nLikewise, Biden refrained from mentioning his own vice president, who is now the clear frontrunner to take on Trump in his absence from the race.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That is the best way to unite our nation,\" Biden said.\n\nWith many Republicans calling on Biden to resign as president in light of his decision not to seek a second term, the president made clear that he does not intend to do so.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as president,\" Biden said. \"That means I will continue to lower costs for hard-working families and grow our economy. I will keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights -- from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nBiden also pledged to \"keep calling out hate and extremism,\" to continue working on his \"cancer moonshot,\" on Supreme Court reforms, to continue to support Ukraine in its war with Russia and to seek an end to the fighting in Gaza.\n\nAs he read his speech from a teleprompter, Biden, 81, occasionally stumbled over his words.\n\n\"In this moment, we can see those we disagree with not as enemies -- as, but as fellow Americans -- can we do that?\" he said at one point.\n\nHis delivery was, at times, reminiscent of the much-criticized debate performance in late June that caused consternation among Democrats as to whether he was still up to running for a second term in office.\n\n\"You know, we've come so far since my inauguration,\" Biden said looking back at his time as president, \"On that day, I told that as I stood in the winter, I stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities. Peril and possibilities. We're in the grip of the -- we were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century.\"\n\nBiden's speech also had an eye on the president's legacy.\n\n\"I ran for president four years ago because I believed, and still do, that the soul of America was at stake, the very nature of who we are was at stake, and that's still the case,\" he said.\n\nBut the president also listed what he saw as some of his most important accomplishments, including signing toxic burn pit legislation to help U.S. soldiers, passing the \"first major gun safety law in 30 years,\" overseeing a drop in the violent crime rate, nominating the first Black woman to the Supreme Court and helping to pass the country's \"most significant climate law.\"\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others, I've been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people,\" Biden said. \"I hope you have some idea of how grateful I am, to all of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People',\" he said.\n\nThe president also acknowledged that the calls for him to step aside made it \"clear\" that it was critical to unite the Democratic Party in the hopes of preserving democracy in the United States.\n\nHe encouraged voters to take the power of the future in their hands and vote for a democratic future - something he has continuously warned Trump will not respect.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have raised concerns that Trump will implement drastic changes to the executive branch, consolidating power and installing loyalists over civil servants - an aspect of Project 2025.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title,\" Biden said during his primetime address.\n\nBiden has already endorsed Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee. Since announcing his withdrawal, Democratic leaders such as Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries, Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton and more have also endorsed the vice president.\n\nThe former California senator quickly consolidated her party's support by locking down votes from the 1,976 delegates needed for the nomination in a first round of voting among Democratic delegates.\n\nThough Biden will not be a candidate for a second term, he will remain in office through January 20, 2025 -- the day his successor will be sworn in on the steps of the US Capitol -- he pledged to spend the remaining six months of his term working toward the goals he set for his administration like lowering costs for working class families, growing the economy and defending civil rights.\n\nHe highlighted his accomplishments as president, like appointing the first Black Supreme Court justice, creating policies to combat climate change, enacting gun violence reform, maintaining democracy and establishing a diverse administration.\n\nAnd as he brought his remarks to a solemn close, the president thanked Americans for the support that had allowed him the chance to accomplish those things.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to this nation, I've been blessed a million times in return,\" he said. \"I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

It's the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nPlacing himself at the end of a long chain of American leaders, Biden mentioned presidents from George Washington to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Twice he noted that he was speaking from behind the Resolute Desk -- a gift of Britain's Queen Victoria that has been used by nearly every president since the 1880s.\n\nRead more: 'Lawyerly, sharp mind' or 'dumb as a rock'? The ugly race to recast Harris is underway\n\nBiden's family watched from just off camera, while hundreds of administration staff members attended a White House viewing party. Harris watched the address in Houston, where she was staying overnight after visiting the city's emergency operations center for a briefing on recovery efforts following Hurricane Beryl.\n\nAlthough the 11-minute speech did not mention Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, implicit throughout was the threat Biden contends his opponent poses. (That claim stems largely from Trump's attempt to reverse the results of the 2020 election, which he lost to Biden.)\n\n\"The defense of democracy, which is at stake, is more important than a title,\" he said. \"It's not about me, it's about you ... your families, your futures. It's about 'we the people.' We can never forget that and I never have.\"\n\nBiden gave a long list of his accomplishments, saying he had pulled the country out of \"the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression\" -- caused by the COVID-19 pandemic -- and signed laws that strengthened gun regulations and capped the price of prescription drugs for senior citizens.\n\nHe pledged to keep working hard in his final six months in office, saying he hoped to end the war in Gaza and bring home hostages held by Hamas; to strengthen NATO, in support of Ukraine and other nations, and to bring reforms to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nToward the end of his remarks, he endorsed Harris. \"She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable,\" Biden said. \"She's been an incredible partner to me and the leader for our country.\"\n\nAt one point he struck a highly personal note.\n\n\"Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter, from modest beginnings ... one day sit behind the Resolute Desk, in the Oval Office, as president of the United States. Here I am,\" he said. \"That's what's so special about America. We're a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, of ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things.\"\n\nOnly last week, Biden had scoffed at the notion he would leave the race. Speaking at the NAACP's national convention in Las Vegas, he called out to the audience: \"So let me ask you, are you all in?\" The loud response: \"All in!\" To which Biden retorted: \"Because I'm all in!\"\n\nBut just a day later, on July 17, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) joined those calling on Biden to step aside, saying \"it is time to pass the torch\" to new leaders in the Democratic Party. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) also reportedly informed Biden that she thought he could not win the Nov. 5 election.\n\nPolitical observers said the views of the two Californians were crucial to Biden's decision, announced Sunday, to drop out of his rematch with Trump. Biden had been in Rehoboth Beach, Del., recovering from COVID-19 since last Thursday when he made the decision to withdraw.\n\nHe quickly threw his support behind Harris, saying that picking her as his running mate in 2020 was \"the best decision I've made.\" He added: \"It's time to come together and beat Trump.\"\n\nDemocratic officials and rank-and-file members quickly coalesced around the vice president, making her the all-but-certain presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in Chicago, starting Aug. 19.\n\nHarris also got good news from her campaign treasurer: She raised $81 million in the 24 hours after Biden announced that he would not seek another term -- the largest campaign haul over that period in history.\n\nThe closest parallel to Biden's speech in modern times came more than half a century ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson used a televised address from the White House to say that he would not seek a second full term in the White House.\n\nRead more: Coconuts, 'brat summer' and that laugh: The memeing of Kamala Harris\n\nJohnson spent all but the waning moments of a nearly 41-minute address, given in March 1968, to discuss America's struggles in the Vietnam War, reiterating his offer to the North Vietnamese to begin peace talks.\n\nHe said that the nation had become too divided over the war in Southeast Asia. Given the momentous decisions he faced overseeing the war and peace talks, Johnson said, \"I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office -- the presidency of your country.\"\n\n\"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president,\" Johnson concluded.\n\nBy stepping back, Johnson opened the door to a hard-fought contest for the Democratic presidential nomination. Robert F. Kennedy appeared in a strong position to be the nominee after winning the California primary in June.\n\nBut Kennedy was assassinated at the end of his victory party in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968. Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice president, went on to win the nomination. But in the fall, he lost a close election to the Republican nominee, Richard M. Nixon.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

His disastrous debate performance with Trump in June put on display for the entire country and the entire world his own apparent mental and physical incapabilities.\n\nIn his Oval Office address, he explained that he would step aside \"in the defense of democracy,\" giving a new generation the chance to defeat the former president -- whom he didn't name throughout his address -- a challenge Mr. Biden was increasingly unable to meet.\n\n\"This sacred task of protecting our union is not about me -- it's about you,\" he said. \"It's about 'We the People.'\" He warned that America is at a \"rare moment in history\" where \"freedom, justice, and democracy\" are on the line.\n\n\"We are a great nation because we are a good people,\" Mr. Biden said.\n\nWhen the address began, it was clear Mr. Biden -- in his complexion, facial expressions, and tone -- has aged rapidly even since assuming the presidency less than four years ago, when many Democrats still had concerns about his age. He made it clear in his speech that he no longer felt he had the confidence of his party to lead.\n\n\"In recent weeks, it's become clear to me I need to unite my party,\" Mr. Biden admitted. \"Nothing -- nothing -- can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nHe sung the praises of his own administration, including making inroads in combating Communist China's influence, lowering the price of prescription drugs, investing in infrastructure, and signing the first major gun control legislation in three decades.\n\nOn the issues, Mr. Biden was still not trusted by voters to lead going forward, with many telling pollsters that Trump would be better on the economy, affordability, immigration, and crime -- some of the top issues for voters this year.\n\n\"We've come so far since my inauguration,\" the president declared, saying that he was looking forward to doing more work before he leaves office in January.\n\n\"In just a few months, the American people will choose the course of America's future,\" Mr. Biden said, calling on all to make the choice between democracy and autocracy.\n\nThe president has already anointed his successor who he says is able to finish that job and carry the torch. Just since announcing her candidacy and winning her boss's endorsement Sunday, Vice President Harris has raised more than $120 million, signed up tens of thousands to volunteer for the campaign, and unofficially wrapped up the nomination after the requisite number of delegates announced their support.\n\n\"She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. ... Now, the choice is up to you,\" Mr. Biden said. \"Whether we keep our republic is in your hands.\"\n\nAt the end of his address, he thanked voters for giving him the opportunity to serve in public life for more than five decades. \"I gave my heart and my soul to our nation, like so many others,\" the president said. \"I hope you have some idea about how grateful I am. ...

Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.\n\nHis speech was the first direct address to the American people he has delivered since dropping out of the 2024 election and since being diagnosed with COVID one week ago.\n\nDuring the address, he said he believed 'fresh voices' and 'younger voices' are better suited to run the country, address its many concerns and coalesce the country around a capable candidate.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, called the speech a cop out, with Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., saying 'It's very evident to me that he hasn't been running the show for quite some time.'\n\n'Everybody knows about it,' he continued.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addresses the nation from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington Wednesday explaining his decision to no longer seek reelection\n\nEven a Democrat pointed out the president's decline.\n\n'He doesn't look as good or sound as good as he used to,' Rep. Jared Moskowitz, R-Fla., said.\n\n'But I think he's one of the best speeches he's ever given.'\n\nHe called the speech 'moving' and 'memorable.'\n\nThe Democrat also noted how Biden's leadership style is selfless.\n\n'To watch someone say 'I revere this office, but I'm going to step away because it's for the benefit of my country.'' We just don't see that in public office.'\n\nPelosi, who has reportedly had a hand in influencing Biden's decision to step aside, posted a glowing tribute to the president after his remarks.\n\n'Tonight, we saw President Joe Biden - one of America's most consequential presidents - show that he is not only on the right side of history, but on the right side of the future.'\n\n'He has truly made a tangible difference in the lives of the American people. With love and gratitude, I salute President Biden for always believing in the possibilities of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment.'\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden delivers an address to the nation on his decision to end his reelection campaign, from the Oval Office of the White House, as his son Hunter Biden listens, in Washington, D.C.\n\nBiden spoke about how honored he is to have risen through politics for 50 years coming from humble beginnings as a kid from Pennsylvania with a stutter\n\nIn his address, Biden pointed to the future of the country, saying it is time for some one else to step up and lead.\n\n'I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,' Biden said during the speech. 'It's the best way to unite our nation.'\n\nHe continued: 'There's also a time and place for new voices. Fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. And that time of places now.'\n\nHe tried to strike a unifying tone, saying emboldening the next generation of Democratic leaders is a more noble task than his own personal goals.\n\n'You know in recent weeks it's become clear to me, I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor.'\n\n'I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term.'\n\nThe president spoke at length about passing the torch to the next generation of Democrats\n\n'But nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.

That includes personal ambition.\n\n\"So I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nAlthough the 10-minute speech did not mention Republican nominee Donald Trump, implicit throughout was the threat Biden contends his opponent poses.\n\n\"The defense of democracy, which is at stake, is more important than a title,\" he said. \"It's not about me, it's about you ... your families, your futures. It's about 'we the people.' We can never forget that and I never have.\"\n\nToward the end of his remarks, he endorsed Harris. \"She's experienced. She's tough. She's capable,\" Biden said. \"She's been an incredible partner to me and the leader for our country.\"\n\nIn his first address to the nation after announcing Sunday that he was ending his campaign, Biden placed himself in a long line of other American leaders who he said had put the country first -- from George Washington to Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt. He closed by invoking the words of Benjamin Franklin, who said American had formed \"A republic, if you can keep it.\"\n\nBiden told his national audience: \"Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands.\"\n\nOnly last week, Biden had scoffed at the notion he would leave the race. Speaking at the NAACP's national convention in Las Vegas, he called out to the audience: \"So let me ask you, are you all in?\" The loud response: \"All in!\" To which Biden retorted: \"Because I'm all in!\"\n\nBut just a day later, on July 17, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., joined those calling on Biden to step aside, saying \"it is time to pass the torch\" to new leaders in the Democratic Party. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also reportedly informed Biden that she thought he could not win the Nov. 5 election.\n\nPolitical observers said the views of the two Californians were crucial to Biden's decision to drop out of his rematch with Trump. Biden had been in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, recovering from COVID-19 since last Thursday when he made the decision to withdraw.\n\nHe quickly threw his support behind Harris, saying that picking her as his running mate in 2020 was \"the best decision I've made.\" He added: \"It's time to come together and beat Trump.\"\n\nDemocratic officials and rank-and-file members quickly coalesced around the vice president, making her the all-but-certain presidential nominee when the party holds its convention in Chicago, starting Aug. 19.\n\nHarris also got good news from her campaign treasurer: She raised $81 million in the 24 hours after Biden announced he would not seek another term -- the largest campaign haul over that period in history.\n\nThe closest parallel to Biden's speech in modern times came more than half a century ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson used a televised address from the White House to say that he would not seek a second full term in the White House.\n\nJohnson spent all but the waning moments of a nearly 41-minute address, given in March, 1968, to discuss America's struggles in the Vietnam War, reiterating his offer to the North Vietnamese to begin peace talks.\n\nHe said that the nation had become too divided over the war in Southeast Asia. Given the momentous decisions he faced overseeing the war and peace talks, Johnson said, \"I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office -- the Presidency of your country.\"\n\n\"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President,\" Johnson concluded.\n\nBy stepping back, LBJ opened the door to a hard-fought contest for the Democratic presidential nomination. Robert F. Kennedy appeared in a strong position to be the Democratic nominee after winning the California primary in June.\n\nBut Kennedy was assassinated at the end of his victory party in Los Angeles on June 5, 1968. Hubert Humphrey, Johnson's vice president, went on to win the Democratic nomination. But in the fall he lost a close election to the Republican nominee, Richard M. Nixon.\n\n_____", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NAACP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000\n\nprotestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\n___\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke to\n\na roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@thestar.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you. To tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country is larger than any one of us. Those of us who cherish that cause cherish it so much. We must unite to protect it. You know, in recent weeks it has become clear to me that I need to unite my party in this critical endeavor. I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merit a second term. But nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition. So I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It is the best way to unite our nation. I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life. There is also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. That time and place is now.\n\n....\n\nIn just a few months the American people will choose the course of America's future. I made my choice. I made my views known. I want to thank our great vice president, Kamala Harris. She is experienced. She is tough. She is capable. She has been an incredible partner for me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\n\n....\n\n\u00c2 Whether we keep our republic is now in your hands. My fellow Americans, it has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years. Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President Of The United States, and here I am. That is what is so special about America. We are a nation of promise and possibilities. Of dreamers and doers. Ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things. I give my heart and my soul to our nation. Like so many others. I have been blessed 1 million times and return with love and support. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you. The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You have to keep safe. Keep the faith and remember who we are. We are the United States of America.\n\nPresident Biden is a good person with a good heart who has always loved his country and put it first. All of those qualities stood out in his speech. Biden knew that it was more important to save the country than to try to prove the doubters wrong by staying in the presidential race. The risk to the nation was too high, but even if it wasn't, Joe Biden probably would have decided to step aside anyway because that is who he is.\n\nIf Vice President Harris wins in November, Biden will get to take a long victory lap/goodbye parade.

Instead, he's now a lame-duck, having thrown his political weight behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, after being convinced by fellow Democrats that he is politically incapable of seeking a second term in office. His speech at 8 p.m. ET will be his first extensive remarks since his announcement Sunday that he was not running and will serve as the first time many Americans see him since he tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nThe president intends to use the prime-time remarks to reveal to the American people how he arrived at the painful decision, sources told CNN, which he said in his letter Sunday he believed was \"in the best interest of my party and the country.\"\n\nBiden will say his decision to drop out of the race and \"pass the torch\" to a younger generation was one he reached because he believes it will be \"the best way to unite our nation,\" according to excerpts of his remarks.\n\n\"The defense of democracy is more important than any title. I draw strength, and find joy, in working FOR the American people. But this sacred task of perfecting our Union is not about me. It's about you. Your families. Your futures. It's about 'We the People,'\" Biden is expected to say.\n\nHe will add later: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America - lies in your hands.\"\n\nOval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements. It will be only the fourth time Biden has addressed the nation from the setting as president. And it's the second time in just 10 days, following Biden's remarks to the country earlier this month following the assassination attempt against Trump. He's also used the setting to speak about Hamas' attack on Israel last year and to laud the passage of a bipartisan budget agreement.\n\nBiden, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for Covid-19, began drafting his highly anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN. Like all of Biden's public speeches throughout his presidency, officials expect this address will be a work in progress up until delivery.\n\nHow much Biden focuses on what he views as his core achievements of his three-and-a-half years in the office he sought for several decades -- versus how much he details his to-do list for the six months before he leaves the White House -- was still being decided Monday night, officials said.\n\nThe president and his longtime communications aide, Mike Donilon, began early work on the speech shortly after Biden went public with his decision to exit the race, after three weeks of mounting intraparty pressure. (Donilon, a former pollster, played an instrumental role in presenting the data that informed Biden's decision to step aside.)\n\nHarris, who quickly secured the backing of enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination, hit the campaign trail Tuesday in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, where she sought to draw a contrast with Trump. The former president will hold his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out in North Carolina on Wednesday. A CNN poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in the race between Harris and Trump, but it showed a closer contest than earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.\n\nAs Harris visited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, Biden briefly called in, vowing \"to get as much done as I possibly can\" in his remaining time in office.\n\nAnd while the party moves on from Biden's candidacy -- reassigning high-profile fundraisers from coast to coast to the Harris camp -- it is also trying to cement his legacy.\n\nThe new CNN poll finds voters widely supportive of both Biden's decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden's policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color.\n\nBiden himself is expected to turn his attention in the coming days and weeks to the legacy of his one-term presidency. But, as one source told CNN, with the decision to drop out of the 2024 race only days old, such discussions have not begun in earnest.\n\nAsked by a reporter what the country should expect during his address as he disembarked Air Force One on Tuesday, Biden responded: \"Watch and listen.\"\n\nCNN's Sam Fossum contributed to this report.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Your families. Your futures.\"\n\nBiden alluded to recent concerns over his age -- which were amplified in the wake of his performance during the first 2024 presidential debate against former President Donald Trump -- and highlighted his endorsement of his vice president, Kamala Harris, who is 22 years his junior.\n\nSpeaking of Harris, 59, he said, \"I decided that the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation . . . It's the best way to unite our nation. There is a time and place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.\"\n\nHarris, he added, is \"experienced, she's tough, she's capable . . . she's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\"\n\nHe never spoke Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump's name, but he repeatedly addressed the stakes of the November 2024 election as he sees them.\n\n\"I've made it clear that I believe America is at an inflection point . . . America is going to have to choose between moving forward or backward,\" he said. \"Between hope and hate. Between unity and division.

Keep the faith, and remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there is nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together.\"\n\nSpeaking further, he said, \"America is an idea . . . the most powerful idea in the history of the world: We hold these truths to be self evident. We're all created equal . . . we've never fully lived up to this sacred idea, but we've never walked away from it either, and I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.\"\n\n\"Now the choice is up to the American people,\" he said. \"When you make that choice, remember the words of Benjamin Franklin . . . asked whether the Founders have given Americans a monarchy or a republic, his answer was, 'a Republic, if you can keep it.' \"\n\nIn announcing he was leaving the 2024 race on July 21, Biden said, \"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President.

And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee for our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nIn her own statement, Harris said she was \"honored to have the President's endorsement and my intention is to earn and win this nomination.\"\n\n\"Over the past year, I have traveled across the country, talking with Americans about the clear choice in this momentous election. And that is what I will continue to do in the days and weeks ahead,\" Harris stated. \"I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party -- and unite our nation -- to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda.\"\n\n\"We have 107 days until Election Day,\" she concluded. \"Together, we will fight. And together, we will win.\"\n\nDocuments filed with the Federal Election Commission in the hours after the announcement reflected the change, and retitled the campaign to \"Harris for President.\"\n\nHarris' campaign took in more than $81 million in the 24 hours following the announcement, making it the largest 24-hour haul by any candidate in presidential history.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolute_desk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Resolute desk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/cBRnP4hUVso8Ky2dV4jQiepp030=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x173:751x175)/biden-utah-shooting-080923-tout-6e91743d22a24607b4a596034357dd5b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 441, "textEnd": 448}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-21", "textStart": 856, "textEnd": 863, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

He has previously resisted efforts in his party to \"pack\" the high court by adding justices to the current nine to achieve favorable outcomes for liberals.\n\nBiden first announced in a letter to the public Sunday that he was dropping his re-election bid before the Democratic National Convention, which convenes Aug. 19.\n\nHe subsequently announced he was supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nCritics have pointed out that Harris dropped out of the 2020 Democratic primaries before a single state voted, so low was she in the polls. Biden picked her as his running mate even though she essentially called him a racist during a debate.\n\nHe sought to reassure the public Wednesday night that he plans to finish his term.\n\n\"Over the next six months, I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" Biden said during the prime-time Oval Office address. \"That means I'll continue lowering costs for hardworking families, grow our economy. I'll keep defending our personal freedoms and our civil rights, from the right to vote to the right to choose.\"\n\nThis last point was a reference to abortion on demand, which the Supreme Court ended with its Dobbs ruling overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nDemocrats could face a predicament in replacing Biden on the ballot in several states because a patchwork of state laws determines what a political party must do to substitute someone else as its presidential nominee.\n\nBattleground states such as Georgia and Nevada have procedures under which a presidential candidate may withdraw from the ballot. Wisconsin allows it to occur only in case of death.\n\nThe Biden-Harris campaign began to unravel after the president's poor debate performance against his opponent, former President Donald Trump, whom he defeated in 2020. Gradually, more Democrats became public in calling for Biden to drop out because of his declining mental faculties.\n\nBiden was initially defiant and vowed to remain in the race.\n\nEarlier this year, special counsel Robert Hur issued a report on Biden's possession of classified documents from his years as vice president and senator, characterizing him as \"elderly\" and \"struggling\" with memory loss.\n\nIt made no sense to bring the case to a jury, Hur concluded.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule, the people do,\" Biden told Americans.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_lucas@dailysignal.com", "name": "Fred Lucas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden wrote in a letter that was also posted on social media. Though promising to speak to the nation later in the week, President Biden wasted little time making it clear who should be at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President. And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.

Let's do this,\" President Biden wrote in a separate post shortly after his original letter went live on Sunday, making it clear that Vice-President Kamala Harris was his choice to defeat Trump/Vance.\n\nIn the 24 hours after the news hit and she vowed to earn and win the nomination, VP Harris had earned endorsements from a large chunk of the party, a whole lot of unions, and many more. The big donors found their check-writing pens again because her campaign took in around $90M - setting a record. And with the Democratic National Convention not until next month, VP Harris already has enough verbal commitments in terms of delegates to clinch the nomination. Meanwhile, President Biden took to The White House's Oval Office on Wednesday night for an address to the nation to share that he was stepping down for the sake of Democracy and the nation's future - seeing the need \"to pass the torch to a new generation\" as \"the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nOnce again, President Biden made it clear who the person was he was passing the torch to. \"Now, in just a few months, the American people choose the course of America's future,\" President Biden said. \"I made my choice. I made my views known. I would like to thank our great Vice-President, Kamala Harris. She experienced. She's tough. She's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now the choice is up to you, the American people.\" You can check out the approximately 11-minute speech in the video at the top of the post, where President Biden also lists his agenda for his remaining six months in office - including Supreme Court reform, gun control, defending abortion rights and citizens' right to vote, and more.

His Oval Office speech didn't help.", "body": "It's hard to believe that President Joe Biden's \"big boy\" solo press conference was only two weeks ago. It feels like a lifetime of news has happened since then.\n\nAt that event, the media grilled Biden about his horrible performance at the June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the end of the press conference, Biden was asked this question: \"If your team came back and showed you data that she [Vice President Kamala Harris] would fare better against former President Donald Trump, would you reconsider your decision to stay in the race?\n\nAnd Biden answered in his weird whisper: \"No, unless they came back and said, 'There's no way you can win.' Me. No one is saying that. No poll says that.\"\n\nHow quickly times change.\n\nSince then, Trump faced an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania; the Republican National Convention officially nominating Trump took place in Milwaukee; and Biden got COVID.\n\nOh, and on Sunday, Biden dropped out of the presidential race via a letter on social media.\n\nDemocrats were warned: Conservatives told the truth about Biden. Democrats failed to listen.\n\nBiden told the country that it has been the \"honor of my life to serve as your president,\" but he said he has also realized that it's time to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nNo incumbent president since Lyndon Johnson in 1968 has decided not to seek re-election, and Biden waited much longer to make his choice. We're less than a month from the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\n\nHow did Biden go from being so adamant that he'd soldier on with his campaign to believing \"it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" as he wrote in his letter Sunday?\n\nBiden didn't offer a good explanation in his Wednesday address.\n\nHis illness, along with his sudden decision to abandon the presidential race, spurred all kinds of unfounded rumors, with people wondering if Biden had been hospitalized or worse. Biden wasn't seen publicly for nearly a week until he left his home Tuesday in Delaware.\n\nAnd Americans' uncertainty about the condition of their president is on Biden for not making a formal announcement much sooner.\n\nAmericans needed to hear from him directly right away.\n\nBiden's health raises questions: What did Kamala Harris know about Biden's deteriorating health? And when did she know it?\n\nBiden spent much of his brief Oval Office remarks defending his record and what he's done, and how he plans to spend his remaining months in office.\n\nAs he usually does, Biden reiterated how this election is all about preserving and defending our democracy.\n\nYet, Biden did not give an adequate rationale as to why he waited so long to make his decision. By doing so now, so late in the game, he denied Democrats a true primary in which they could have picked from a robust crop of candidates.\n\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don't have the app?

She has quickly become a media darling and star fundraiser now that the party has rallied around her. At 59, she is decades younger than Biden, 81 - and Trump, 78 - but she doesn't bring much else to the table.\n\nBiden also refused to level with the American people about his health, even as he struggled to read at times from the teleprompter.\n\nThere are tumultuous times ahead in the coming months, and Biden did not offer any confidence that he's the one to lead us through them.\n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Framing the upcoming election as a critical juncture for the nation, Biden said that his choice was driven by a profound commitment to democracy, marking the end of his political career.\n\n'Pass the torch ... '\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.That is the best way to unite our nation,\" Biden said. He made his decision after days of soul-searching and agonizing over internal polling that predicted he could lose against Republican Donald Trump in November and drag down fellow Democrats with him.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake - and is more important than any title - I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,\" Biden declared.\n\nBiden's speech began with a heartfelt expression of his love for America and the honor he felt in serving as its president. \"This sacred task of perfecting our union - it's not about me. It's about you, your families, your future. It's about we the people,\" he said, emphasizing that the work of the nation transcends any individual leader.\n\n'Choice between progress and regression'\n\nThis address marked Biden's first public appearance since the announcement of his decision not to seek reelection. He highlighted the importance of the upcoming election, portraying it as a choice between progress and regression, unity and division.\n\n\"America's going to have to choose between moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide: Do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect? Freedom, justice and democracy?\" Biden posed these questions to the nation, expressing confidence in the American people's inherent goodness and their ability to make the right choices.\n\nBiden reiterated his commitment to honesty and truth, qualities he vowed to uphold when he took office. \"We are a great nation because we are good people. When you elected me to this office, I promised to always level with you, to tell you the truth. The truth, the sacred cause of this country, is larger than any one of us. We must unite to protect it,\" he urged.\n\n'Tough and capable' Kamala Harris\n\nBiden praised his Vice President Kamala Harris -- the presumptive nominee for the Democratic presidential ticket -- as \"tough\" and \"capable\" in his address to the nation from the Oval Office.\n\n\"She's experienced, she's tough, she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country. Now, the choice is up to you, the American people,\" Biden said, just days after withdrawing from the election race and endorsing Harris.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

But I love my country more,\" Biden said in a rare Oval Office speech that marked the beginning of the closing chapter of his presidency and half-century in public service.\n\n\"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in defense of democracy, which is at stake - and is more important than any title. I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people,\" he said.\n\nBiden is no longer the presumptive Democratic nominee trying to convince the nation that he still has the stamina and faculties to take on former President Donald Trump in an election in which he warned nothing less than democracy itself is in the balance. Instead, he's now a lame-duck, having thrown his political weight behind his vice president, Kamala Harris, after being convinced by fellow Democrats that he is politically incapable of seeking a second term in office. His speech marked his first extensive remarks since his announcement Sunday that he was not running and will serve as the first time many Americans see him since he tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nOval Office addresses have historically been serious moments for presidents to speak to the American people at times of national crisis or to make major policy announcements. It will be only the fourth time Biden has addressed the nation from the setting as president. And it's the second time in just 10 days, following Biden's remarks to the country earlier this month following the assassination attempt against Trump. He's also used the setting to speak about Hamas' attack on Israel last year and to laud the passage of a bipartisan budget agreement.\n\nBiden, who returned to the White House on Tuesday after testing negative for Covid-19, began drafting his highly anticipated address while isolating with the virus in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, senior officials told CNN. Like all of Biden's public speeches throughout his presidency, officials expect this address will be a work in progress up until delivery.\n\nThe president and his longtime communications aide, Mike Donilon, began early work on the speech shortly after Biden went public with his decision to exit the race, after three weeks of mounting intraparty pressure. (Donilon, a former pollster, played an instrumental role in presenting the data that informed Biden's decision to step aside.)\n\nHarris, who quickly secured the backing of enough delegates to win the Democratic nomination, hit the campaign trail Tuesday in the key battleground state of Wisconsin, where she sought to draw a contrast with Trump. The former president will hold his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out in North Carolina on Wednesday. A CNN poll released Wednesday found no clear leader in the race between Harris and Trump, but it showed a closer contest than earlier CNN polling of the Biden-Trump matchup.\n\nAs Harris visited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, on Monday, Biden briefly called in, vowing \"to get as much done as I possibly can\" in his remaining time in office.\n\nAnd while the party moves on from Biden's candidacy -- reassigning high-profile fundraisers from coast to coast to the Harris camp -- it is also trying to cement his legacy.\n\nThe new CNN poll finds voters widely supportive of both Biden's decision to step aside and his choice to remain in office through the end of his term. But Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters are closely split over whether the next nominee should continue Biden's policies (53%) or take the country in a new direction (47%). Desire for a new direction is largely concentrated among younger voters and voters of color.\n\nBiden himself is expected to turn his attention in the coming days and weeks to the legacy of his one-term presidency.

The 81-year-old president was seen publicly for the first time Tuesday since July 17, dodging questions about his decision to drop out. Biden, giving the fourth Oval Office address of his presidency, said he dropped out for the sake of \"unity,\" while encouraging Americans to vote wisely in the upcoming election. (RELATED: Biden Prompts Calls For 'Proof Of Life' With Post-Dropout Disappearing Act)\n\nThe president, while touting his administration achievements, told the country that the nature of America is at risk in the upcoming election. Biden also promoted Vice President Kamala Harris and attempted to stress the importance of Americans' vote.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith, keep the faith, and remember who we are. We're the United States of America, and there's simply nothing nothing beyond our capacity. We do it together. Let's act together, preserve our democracy,\" Biden said, alluding to his previous campaign message about Trump.\n\nThe calls for Biden to drop out of the presidential election started just thirty minutes into his June 27 debate performance against former President Donald Trump. Biden began stumbling through answers, looking lost and confused.\n\n\"Every Democrat I know is texting that this is bad,\" Obama campaign alumnus Ravi Gupta tweeted just 15 minutes into the debate.\n\nOver the course of several weeks, prominent Democrats came out publicly against Biden. The Biden campaign entered damage control mode, setting up interviews with ABC News, NBC News and a press conference for the president. A NATO press conference bought Biden's campaign more time as he managed to make it through without significant issues.\n\nBut it appeared that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Majority Senate Leader Chuck Schumer finally tipped the scale. Pelosi reportedly confronted the president about his declining poll numbers and ability to actually beat Trump in the election. Then, behind closed doors, Schumer told the president that his decision to stay in the race could cost Democrats down-ballot races, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\"On that day I told you as a st that winter, we're stood in a winter apparel and winter possibilities, peril of possibilities we're in the grip of the war. We were in the grip of the worst pandemic in the century, the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. We came together as Americans. We got through it. We merge stronger, more prosperous and more secure,\" the president said, referring to his inauguration day after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot.\n\nSticking with the theme of his drop out announcement, Biden endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris thirty minutes later in a tweet. Since, Harris has earned the support of prominent Democrats and enough delegates to all but officially secure the nomination. Harris is running based on a party insider vote with virtually no primary voter approval.\n\nThe president made his announcement 107 days ahead of the November election. Biden informed a majority of his staff of his decision just one minute before his twitter account pushed publish on the announcement, according to The New York Times.\n\nAmid calls for the president to resign the presidency, Biden ensured the nation that he continues to finish his term.\n\n\"I've given my heart and my soul to our nation. Like so many others, I've been blessed many times in return the love and support of the American people. I hope you have some idea how grateful I am to all of you.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama_2008_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama 2008 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Great Depression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Civil War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-24-at-8.15.20-PM-e1721866620790.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 200, "textEnd": 207, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1579, "textEnd": 1586}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

His tone was wistful and his speech was an early farewell.\n\n\"It's been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years,'' he said\n\nSitting behind the Resolute Desk and surrounded by photos of his family, Mr. Biden ticked through the accomplishments of his term, ranging from the choice of the first Black woman to be a Supreme Court justice to pulling the country out of a paralyzing pandemic. He expressed gratitude to the American people for allowing a \"kid with a stutter\" from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pa., to reach the pinnacle of American politics.\n\nJust beyond the camera, dozens of aides and several members of his family, including Jill Biden, the first lady, watched as Mr. Biden said he would walk away from the office they had worked to help him reach for decades.\n\n\"I revere this office,\" he said, \"but I love my country more.\"\n\nUltimately, Mr. Biden said, he concluded that \"the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\" The president praised Vice President Kamala Harris -- \"she's experienced, she's tough, she's capable\" -- but warned, as he has for years, that Americans faced a choice between preserving democracy and allowing it to backslide.\n\n\"History is in your hands,\" Mr. Biden said. \"The power is in your hands.

They included the president's son, Hunter Biden, and his granddaughter Finnegan Biden, as well as his daughter Ashley Biden.\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden was also there, as were other family members and the president's longtime adviser, Mike Donilon.\n\nBiden's voice was very soft and sometimes barely audible, though he got a bit louder occasionally. Toward the end of remarks, Ashley Biden reached for the hand of her mother, the first lady, who was seated next to her.\n\nStanding in the back were White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other staff.\n\nWhen Biden concluded, those assembled applauded. Jill Biden then walked to the Resolute Desk and stood next to her husband. \"This has been the honor of a lifetime,\" the president said.\n\nIn 1968, Lyndon Johnson turned down a second term of his own\n\nNo American incumbent president has dropped out of the race so late in the process. The last president to do so was Lyndon Johnson in March of 1968. When Johnson addressed the nation from the Oval Office, he spent the majority of his remarks talking about the Vietnam War, and his duty to focus on it.\n\nHe tried to make the case that American forces were making great progress in the war, and said, \"One day, my fellow citizens, there will be peace in Southeast Asia.\" That portrait was at odds with the politics in the Democratic Party, riven by division over the war, prompting several prominent Democrats, including Eugene McCarthy and Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nJohnson also acknowledged how the war was tearing the country apart. \"In these times as in times before, it is true that a house divided against itself by the spirit of faction, of party, of region, of religion, of race, is a house that cannot stand. There is division in the American house now.\"\n\nHe then made the stunning announcement that he would not seek reelection.\n\n\"I shall not be a candidate for reelection. I have served my country long, and I think efficiently and honestly. I shall not accept a renomination. I do not feel that it is my duty to spend another 4 years in the White House.\"\n\nTrump calls Biden's Oval Office address 'sooo bad'\n\nTrump posted on his social media website that the president \"was barely understandable, and sooo bad!\"\n\nDuring the speech, Biden called Vice President Harris \"tough\" and \"capable.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Trump slammed Biden and Harris as embarrassments, noting, \"THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A TIME LIKE THIS!\"\n\nThe view from Trump's campaign plane\n\nAs President Biden addressed the nation, his former opponent was among those watching.\n\nTrump watched Biden's 10-minute address from his campaign plane as he flew out of North Carolina following a rally.\n\nPhotographs showed Trump watching Biden speak intently, his head tilted sideways.\n\nTrump adviser Chris LaCivita subsequently posted on X a different picture showing the former president turned sideways and frowning, intently not watching as Biden spoke.\n\n\"On Trump Force One ...Hey Joe ...You're Fired!\" LaCivita wrote over the picture.\n\nLove, Jill\n\nFirst lady Jill Biden posted a hand-written note after the president's speech thanking \"those who never wavered, who refused to doubt.\" She thanked supporters for putting their trust in the president. \"Now it's time to put that trust in Kamala.\"\n\nShe signed it: Love, Jill.\n\n9 arrested during DC protests over the war in Gaza\n\nPolice in the nation's capital say they have arrested nine people after thousands of protesters against the war in Gaza descended on Washington to condemn Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department said the arrests included five people taken into custody Wednesday morning on charges of crowding or incommoding. Later in the day, a 15-year-old was arrested for assaulting a police officer in front of Union Station.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags, lit one ablaze and hoisted Palestinian flags in their place to massive cheers in the crowd.\n\nThree men were also arrested for assaulting a police officer and crossing a police line in Columbus Circle, outside Union Station, police said.\n\nBiden says he put party unity over a 'merited' second term\n\nDefending his tenure, Biden said his \"record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term.\" But, he said, \"I needed to unite my party.\"\n\nContrasting himself with Trump, he added, \"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nBiden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy chemical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's speech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib holds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not playing around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily membersof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000protestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke toa roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gazette.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Palestine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Union_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Union Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashida Tlaib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

Moreover, Biden promised to \"keep speaking out\" and \"keep fighting\" for Americans, especially when it comes to gun violence and Supreme Court reform.\n\nWhile reflecting on his upbringing in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Biden noted that he never imagined he would reach the position he's in now.\n\n\"We're a nation of promise and possibilities, of dreamers and doers, ordinary Americans doing extraordinary things,\" he explained. \"I gave my heart and my soul to this nation. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president.\"\n\nAlthough he relinquished any chance for re-election, Biden acknowledged that the \"best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" specifically the \"new voices\" and \"younger voices.\"\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my vision for America's future ... nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" he added, before crediting his vice president, Kamala Harris, as an \"incredible partner.\" Biden also called the 59-year-old presumptive Democratic nominee \"tough\" and more than capable of propelling the nation forward.\n\n\"It has been the privilege of my life to serve this nation for 50 years,\" he concluded. \"The idea of America lies in your hands.

Reports quickly circulated describing his family watching on emotionally - with his daughter wiping away a tear as her father spoke, marking the end of his 51-year political career.\n\nSupporters of President Biden assembled outside the White House in a show of support as he delivered an Oval Office speech explaining why he's not running in the 2024 race. Some held placards reading: \"We love Joe,\" while a brass band played.\n\nThe tone of Biden's brief speech was a stark contrast to the hours of name-calling rambles heard just hours earlier from Trump at his rally in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nREAD MORE: US President Joe Biden 'passes the baton to younger generations' as he endorses Kamala Harris\n\nBiden stated that it's now up to the American people to decide this election as he concludes his career.

Biden outlined a packed agenda for his remaining six months, prioritising efforts to bring an end to the conflict in Gaza.\n\nIn addition to foreign policy, Biden plans to focus on defending personal freedoms and reducing expenses for hardworking American families. He remains committed to advocating for Supreme Court reform and continues his fight to shield children from gun violence.\n\nHis initiative to eradicate cancer is also high on his list of priorities.\n\nJust three days after Biden stepped back from the presidential race amid concerns from senior Democratic figures about his ability to serve another term, he has thrown his support behind Harris as his successor. \"While it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term,\" Biden stated in a letter shared on Twitter.\n\nHe promised to address the nation later in the week to discuss his decision in greater detail.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abigail_o_leary@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Abigail O'Leary", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "phoebe_tonks@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Phoebe Tonks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_liberties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil liberties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/article33320604.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_sdc_mdg_chp_67271jpg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

A cause of American democracy itself. We must unite to protect it,\" Biden said, stressing, \"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy.\" Social media users on X, however, pointed out that an 'orange' looking Biden struggled to pronounce his words while reading from a teleprompter in the Oval Office.\n\nSlamming the US President, Collin Rugg, a popular Conservative voice on X said, \"Biden said he had to 'save democracy' by letting his own party stage a coup on him.\" \"Those who cherry that cause, cherish it so much. A cause of Americademocritcy itself. We must unite to protect it. Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" Rugg quoted Biden as saying during the speech.\n\nOne of the users said, \"He (Biden) is once again reading his lines and I still believe he has no idea what's going on but doing what he is told. \"The democrat party committed a coup against the American people. Your votes don't matter folks,\" claimed a Republican skeptic. Yet another critic said, \"Biden sounds like someone had him tied up in a basement for 6 days and is now being forced to read a letter from his captors telling us that he's ok.\"\n\nBiden tried to outlast the skepticism and quell the concerns with interviews and tepid rallies, but the pressure to step aside only mounted from the party's political elites and from ordinary voters. On Sunday afternoon while isolating at his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, home with COVID-19, Biden finally bowed in a letter posted to his account on X announcing his decision to leave the race, followed up later by an endorsement of Harris.\n\nShortly before the US President's address, White House Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre Wednesday said that any question of Biden resigning his office -- which would allow Harris to run as an incumbent -- was \"ridiculous.\" She said Biden has \"no regrets\" about his decision to stay in the race as long as he did, or his decision to quit it over the weekend. She said Biden's decision had nothing to do with his health.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprompter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Teleprompter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehoboth_Beach,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rehoboth Beach, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-1-2024-07-bf3d102ac454c6ed53698f326bcf8fd5-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

This was the first time in decades that a US president has dropped out of the reelection race. Following the first televised debate in June, Biden experienced increasing scrutiny for his subpar showing, leading to mounting pressure from Democrats and voters for him to exit the race. He has repeatedly emphasized that he would continue participating in the election, but the pressure from all parties has only increased. Biden's decision caught many White House staff off guard with several expressing shock at the news. Just hours ago, the Biden campaign denied reports that Biden was considering withdrawing from the presidential election. Biden was said to be particularly annoyed with former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom his advisers believed was instigating a campaign to force him to withdraw from the race.\n\nAccording to CNN, a senior campaign adviser to Biden said he made the final decision to withdraw from the race in the past 48 hours after consulting his family and senior advisers over the phone. On Friday the 19th local time, after Biden recovered from being quarantined at home after contracting the coronavirus, he did not have a final interview with senior campaign team members or White House advisers.\n\nTrump and Republicans harshly criticize Biden\n\nIn a brief phone interview with NBC News, Republican presidential candidate Trump reacted to Biden's withdrawal from the race, saying: \"Joe Biden is the worst president in the history of the United States.\"\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\n\"There has never been a president who has done a great job for our country. He has caused so much damage - from energy independence to allowing millions of illegal immigrants to enter the country,\" Trump added.\n\n\"We will correct what he has done,\" Trump continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump also criticized Biden in a post on social media platform X.\n\nTrump said: \"He doesn't deserve to run for president, and he certainly can't be president. He never can. Biden has occupied the presidency by lying, disinformation and hiding in basements. Everyone around Biden, including doctors and the media, knows that he cannot be president. Now look at our country: There are millions of people with no access to inspections and no visas, many of them from prisons and mental hospitals, and record numbers of terrorists entering American soil.\"\n\nUS Republican lawmakers have repeatedly publicly called on Biden to resign.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson tweeted: \"If Biden is not fit to run for President, he is not fit to be President. He must resign immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJohnson also criticized Harris for not being any better than Biden, saying that she is also responsible for the policy failures of the Biden administration.\n\n\"As the No. 2 figure and the completely incompetent person in charge of border affairs, Harris is not only undermining US sovereignty and security,\" Johnson said, adding that Harris also undermined US prosperity and was an accomplice in the largest political cover-up in American history.\n\n\"Harris, like everyone else, has known for a long time that Biden is not qualified for this position,\" Johnson continued.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik of New York State tweeted: \"If Biden cannot run for reelection, he cannot and is not suitable to serve as president of the United States. He must resign immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina asked: \"Can a president who does not have the mental acuity or cognitive ability to fight an election serve for another 6 months? He should resign.\"\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate JD Vance and other Republicans called on Biden to resign immediately from the White House before he announced his withdrawal from the race. Vance said in a message sent by the X platform that if Biden withdrew from the race, it would mean that Biden was not mentally qualified to serve as president.\n\nDemocrats face many challenges\n\nThe first challenge was the issue of succession. CNN reported that late last Sunday, the campaign teams of Biden and Vice President Harris formally revised the documents submitted to the Federal Election Commission and nominated Harris to run for president. However, this did not mean that Harris was the confirmed nominee; it depended on the final decision of the Democratic National Convention delegates. The conference usually took place from August 19 to 22. Although former House Speaker Pelosi expressed her approval of Biden's withdrawal from the election in her statement, she did not express support for Harris. Pelosi had previously said she would prefer to start an open nomination process to select Democratic candidates. At present, there were several candidates who might join the race. Vice President Kamala Harris was at the top of the list, but she was running into problems of her own after a rocky start on the job and poor polling numbers. The US Constitution stipulated that the vice president would succeed the president if the president died or became incapacitated, but this did not affect the bipartisan nomination process. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker had all been considered possible successors. A free-for-all could ensue among these Democratic heavyweights. Some 4,672 delegates were expected in 2024, including 3,933 pledged delegates and 739 so-called superdelegates or senior party members, based on Ballotpedia. To win the nomination, a candidate needed a majority, which was, more votes than everyone else combined. If no one did this, then there was a \"broker's conference\" where delegates were free to negotiate with the party leadership. And there would be rules set and a roll call vote on the nominees. It might take several rounds of voting for someone to gain a majority and become a candidate. The last brokerage convention where Democrats failed to nominate a candidate on the first ballot was in 1952.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe second challenge was the issue of Biden's campaign funds. The Biden-Harris campaign had $91 million in its bank account as of the end of May, but campaign finance law experts were divided over how much of the money had changed hands. Since Harris was also on campaign documents, many experts believed the money could be transferred to her if she ran. However, there was some controversy over whether one needed to be formally nominated as a party candidate before the transfer could take place.\n\nThe third challenge was the strong attack from the Trump campaign team. Trump's main political action committee, Make America Great Again, had prepared an attack ad against Harris. An official said they were working to air the ad on major media platforms in Pennsylvania, Georgia and other states. The ad claimed that Harris \"participated in covering up the reality of Biden's mental decline.\" After the Democratic Party \"changed generals,\" they discussed how to choose a better strategy to confront Trump head-on and prepare for the second presidential debate that might be held in September. It might become a great difficulty for the successor or the Democratic Party. In addition, did Harris have the ability to quickly establish her authority and recognition among party insiders and voters? Democrats had heavily criticized Trump in previous campaigns, accusing him of being a \"criminal\" and \"undermining democracy.\" However, after the assassination attempt, Republicans believed that such criticism was the primary reason for the attempt, which largely caused the Democratic Party's campaign to be unable to continue to be effective in the short term.\n\nAssociated Press analysis said after Biden withdrew from the election, the Democratic Party needed to take urgent action to start the nomination process in the next few weeks and convince voters in a \"very short period\" that Biden's successor could defeat Trump. ability. With Trump's assassination attempt boosting the Republican election, and with Harris' qualifications and abilities being questioned by the outside world, the election might show a trend favorable to the Republican Party in the short term.\n\nPAID ADVERTORIAL\n\nAdvertisement", "source": {"uri": "manilatimes.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Manila times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It's been the honor of my life to serve as your President, but in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title,\" said the president.\n\n\"I draw strength and I find joy in working for the American people, but this sacred task of perfecting our union, it's not about me, it's about you, your families, your futures,\" he continued, before emphasizing the importance of the upcoming election: \"I ran for President four years ago because I believed and still do, that the soul of America was a stake. The very nature of who we are is at stake.\"\n\nHe added: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands, the powers in your hands, the idea of America lies in your hands. You just have to keep faith. Keep the faith, and remember who we are.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Biden issued a public letter on his official social media accounts, writing that \"it has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President. And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nShortly after making the announcement, the president threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor to lead the 2024 Democratic ticket. \"My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my Vice President,\" Biden wrote on social media. \"And it's been the best decision I've made. Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nHarris has managed to quickly coalesce the support of prominent Democratic lawmakers and a majority of convention delegates behind her bid. By Monday night, at least 2,579 delegates -- scores more than the 1,976 needed to secure the nomination -- had pledged their support to the vice president, making her the presumptive nominee.\n\n\"When I announced my campaign for president, I said I intended to go out and earn this nomination,\" Harris wrote in a Monday statement. \"Tonight, I am proud to have secured the broad support needed to become our party's nominee,\" she said, adding: \"I look forward to formally accepting the nomination soon.\"\n\nHarris will likely be officially confirmed before the Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled to begin on August 19, in a virtual roll call vote sometime in the coming weeks. In the meantime, Harris is raising astronomical amounts in small-dollar donations, and vetting potential candidates who could fill the vice presidential slot on her presumptive ticket.\n\nSome of the names under consideration include Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Beshear", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Beshear"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_methods_in_deliberative_assemblies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voting methods in deliberative assemblies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Kentucky", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/biden-address.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 2836, "textEnd": 2845}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

She first joined Vox in 2019, and her work has also appeared in Politico, Washington Monthly, and the New Republic.\n\nPresident Joe Biden addressed the nation from the Oval Office Wednesday night in the culmination of a pivotal few weeks that saw him relinquish the Democratic presidential nomination -- an act that may one day be the defining moment of his political career.\n\nThe speech was an attempt to exit political life gracefully, but it also served as a reminder that only days after the president announced his unprecedented decision, the nation has already moved on.\n\nDemocratic delegates quickly consolidated behind Biden's chosen successor, Vice President Kamala Harris, and nearly 90 percent of Democratic voters surveyed said he made the right choice in a recent CNN poll conducted by SSRS. The media limelight has shifted to Harris, the new presumptive Democratic nominee, and what her presidency would look like. And Democrats have been able to refocus with renewed enthusiasm on their task at hand, which is beating former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat's left Biden suddenly in the role of elder statesman. Under extraordinary circumstances just months before the 2024 election, he's unexpectedly fulfilled his 2020 promise to become a \"bridge\" to the next generation of leadership.\n\n\"I decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden said in his speech. \"It is the best way to unite our nation.\"\n\nNow that he's done so, the question arises: What, if anything, is left for an outgoing president to do?\n\nBiden himself insists that his work is not done, and made it clear Wednesday night that he wants to tie up loose ends on policy. For instance, he promised to continue his efforts to protect democracy, at home and abroad. And he's vowed to deliver a ceasefire in Gaza before he leaves office.\n\nBut beyond Biden's legacy -- and the needs of the country -- there's still a campaign going on. So what role can he play in both?\n\nStrategists and pollsters agree: Biden can be useful to Harris on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden clearly thinks so too. On Monday, he said at a campaign event in Delaware via teleconference, \"I'm going to be on the road, and I'm not going anywhere.\" He reiterated his support for Harris Wednesday night: \"She's tough; she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\"\n\nChuck Rocha, a former senior adviser for Sen. Bernie Sanders's 2020 campaign, said that Biden has an opportunity to help Harris with union members and white working-class voters in Pennsylvania and Michigan -- groups that helped power his 2020 victory.\n\nEvan Roth Smith, lead pollster for Blueprint, said that Biden also needs to speak to the voters who have been most loyal to him, even over the course of the last month, and tell them that it's important that they not just turn out to vote for Harris, but knock on doors on her behalf.\n\nFernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster, said that Biden can reassert the successes of his administration as a \"political wind behind the sails of the Kamala campaign,\" emphasizing her role in getting things done.\n\nBut Harris also has the unusual opportunity to get a second chance at a first impression and to define herself outside of being Biden's vice president. Voters don't associate her as much with the issues on which they rated the administration poorly, like inflation and immigration, Roth Smith said.\n\n\"So she has this important opportunity to distance herself a little bit,\" he said. \"It's important to not squander that and not overly tie her to Biden.\"\n\nBiden also risks generating further questions about whether or not he should continue as president until the end of his term if he participates in the kinds of campaign events in which he has proven more likely to commit verbal flubs, Amandi said. Though Amandi added that he believes Biden wouldn't complete his term if the president and his doctors didn't think him capable, Republicans have recently argued that Biden is not fit for office and should step down now.\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure on Biden to get out there, particularly following the debate performance, and do the kinds of events that he was less comfortable doing,\" Roth Smith said. \"He doesn't need to do those kinds of events anymore ... We don't necessarily need him all over the campaign trail.\"\n\nThat's especially the case given that, soon, Harris will have another major surrogate on her team in the form of her vice presidential candidate. Once she chooses a running mate, \"there will literally be three people who can help bring this thing home for November for the Democrats,\" two of which -- Harris and her vice presidential pick -- can provide \"a fresh-faced contrast to Donald Trump,\" Rocha said.\n\nEssentially, the move for Biden experts say, is for him to help out Harris where he can, but not overexpose himself. Biden seemed to recognize Wednesday that it was time for him to take something of a step back. \"I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" he said. \"There is also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices. Yes, younger voices. That time and place is now.\"\n\nStrategists and pollsters told me that Biden should focus on being president for the remainder of his time in office, and as he noted in his speech, that's what he intends to do.\n\n\"An important role for the president is to be this statesman, to show that Democrats can govern,\" Roth Smith said.\n\nBeing competent, while finding opportunities to remind voters of the accomplishments of his administration -- from the Inflation Reduction Act to the bipartisan infrastructure law -- is one of the best ways he can support Harris.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration has a fantastic story to tell,\" Amandi said. \"It was a story that had been undermined by the legitimate concerns about whether or not the president could continue another four years.\"\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said that \"Biden's ability to do anything truly substantive is muted\" given that he faces a divided Congress and election season is in full swing. But there are certain things that the president can do unilaterally.\n\nFor one, Americans are depending on his vast foreign policy experience at a tenuous moment for the Middle East and Europe. In his speech, he said he would seek to \"bring peace and security to the Middle East\" and keep rallying a coalition of nations to stop the Russian takeover of Ukraine, bolstering NATO and US allies in the Pacific. All that may not be achievable in five months, but he can work on making visible progress.\n\nBiden may also look for domestic policy wins on issues that had dogged his candidacy, including immigration and inflation, which seems to be improving in time for the Federal Reserve to likely cut interest rates later this year. He can also highlight accomplishments on lesser-known, but still incredibly popular policies such as negotiating decreases in drug prices for Americans on Medicare. On Wednesday, he highlighted proposed Supreme Court reforms and his cancer \"moonshot\" among his priorities.\n\nAnd as the administration makes progress, Biden needs to make sure he is \"sharing the stage,\" Roth Smith said.\n\n\"If there is going to be a great inflation report or a consumer confidence report, [Harris] needs to get credit for that,\" he added.\n\nThat also serves the dual purpose of solidifying Biden's legacy and increasing his approval rating, which Kondik said is also helpful to Harris.\n\n\"I think President Biden will leave office in January with significantly higher approval ratings because the one obstacle to judging him in the context of his success has now been removed, which is the concern that he would seek reelection at an age where his physical limitations wouldn't allow him to continue,\" Amandi said.\n\nThe stakes are still high for Democrats. Biden's remaining time in office has the potential to lay the groundwork for a smooth transition to another Democratic administration that could protect the policies he set in motion. But as Biden himself has put it, before anyone -- even Harris -- can take over, he has to \"finish the job.\"", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vox"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Later in the day, a 15-year-old was arrested for assaulting a police officer in front of Union Station.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags, lit one ablaze and hoisted Palestinian flags in their place to massive cheers in the crowd.\n\nThree men were also arrested for assaulting a police officer and crossing a police line in Columbus Circle, outside Union Station, police said.\n\nBiden says he put party unity over a 'merited' second term\n\nDefending his tenure, Biden said his \"record as president, our leadership in the world, my vision for America's future all merited a second term.\" But, he said, \"I needed to unite my party.\"\n\nContrasting himself with Trump, he added, \"Nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. And that includes personal ambition.\"\n\nBiden never mentioned Trump, but his allusions were clear\n\nThough Biden never mentioned his political rival, it was clear the Democratic incumbent was talking about the possibility of former President Trump returning for a second presidency.\n\n\"I revere this office, but I love my country more. It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president. But in the defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think it is more important than any title,\" Biden said in the opening minutes of his speech.\n\nBiden called this election year \"one of those rare moments in history when the decisions we make now determine the fate of our nation and the world for decades to come. Americans are going to have to choose moving forward or backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division. We have to decide do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.\"\n\nAnd, he asked, \"Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThose are many of the same critiques Biden leveled against Trump in the 2020 campaign.\n\nBiden uses address to shape his legacy and the upcoming election\n\nThe address gave Biden a chance to try to shape how history views his one and only term in office.\n\nIt gave the public a chance to hear directly from Biden his rationale for dropping out of the 2024 after weeks of insisting he believed himself to be the best candidate to take on former President Trump, whom he has called an existential threat to the nation's democracy.\n\nBoth Biden and Harris have framed the election as a choice between freedom and chaos, but he tried to steer clear of overt campaigning from his official office and never mentioned Trump by name.\n\n\"The great thing about America is, here, kings and dictators do not rule,\" Biden said. \"The people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America -- lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden wraps 10-minute address\n\nBiden says he's grateful to have served as president -- in no other country could a kid with a stutter grow up to sit in the Oval Office.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, it's been the privilege of my life,\" he says.\n\nHe told Americans to \"keep the faith,\" and \"the idea of America lies in your hands.\"\n\nBiden's has a busy 6 months planned\n\nBiden says he has a busy to-do list for his final six months in office.\n\nHe says he's going to work to end the war in Gaza.\n\nBiden also mentioned that he'll work to defend personal freedoms and lower costs for hardworking families. He says he'll continue to push for Supreme Court reform and will keep seeking to protect children from gun violence. He says he'll keep up his initiative seeking to end cancer as we know it.\n\nBiden says it's time for 'fresh voices, yes, younger voices' in politics\n\nPresident Biden is explaining why he is stepping away from the 2024 election. He says, \"I revere this office, but I love my country more.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. It's the best way to unite our nation,\" said Biden.\n\nHe said he thought it best to unite his party. Some Democrats had been calling for him to step down.\n\nBiden supporters gather outside the White House\n\nSupporters of President Biden have gathered outside the White House in a show of support as the president gives an Oval Office to explain why he's stepping away from the 2024 race.\n\nSome held signs that read: \"We love Joe,\" and a brass band played.\n\nBiden addresses the nation in Oval Office Address\n\nPresident Joe Biden is addressing the nation from the Oval Office after his decision to step down from the 2024 race.\n\nDozens of his staff members filed into the White House to watch the address together.\n\nBiden bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nTrump lays in to 'lyin' Kamala Harris'\n\nTrump opened his remarks at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, saying he defeated Biden, adding the Democrats \"had a very undemocratic move\" and forced him out.\n\n\"Now, we have a new victim to defeat: lyin' Kamala Harris,\" he said, mispronouncing her name, and proceeding to attack her record on the border.\n\nBiden to tell nation that the 'defense of democracy is more important than any title' as he explains dropping 2024 bid\n\nPresident Joe Biden is giving an Oval Office address this evening where he's expected to say that he will spend the next six months doing his job as president, but that he decided the best way forward was to \"pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe president bowed to pressure from his own party to step aside following his disastrous debate performance on June 27. He posted a letter on Sunday telling the public about his decision but was sick with COVID-19 at the time and said he'd address the nation later.\n\nBiden says in excerpts of his remarks that the \"great thing about America is kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nBiden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nFamilies of American hostages in Gaza are 'profoundly disappointed' in Netanyahu\n\nThe families of the eight American hostages being held in Gaza say they're \"profoundly disappointed\" that Prime Minister Netanyahu did not guarantee in his speech to Congress that the hostages would be coming home.\n\nIn a joint statement, the families said that Netanyahu \"failed to present any new solutions or a new path forward\" and \"failed to commit to the hostage deal that is now on the table even though Israel's senior defense and intelligence officials have called on him to do so.\"\n\nThey called on him to get the deal done \"before it is too late.\"\n\nEight Americans are believed to be held by Hamas, including three who were killed.\n\nTrump rally attendees are still feeling out JD Vance\n\nFans and supporters awaiting Trump in Charlotte say they are amped to meet their nominee. But his running mate? They're still waiting to learn more about him.\n\nA handful of voters interviewed Wednesday by The Associated Press ahead of Trump's late afternoon campaign rally said they had watched the Netflix biopic about JD Vance's life, based on his bestselling book, but aside from that, they didn't know much about the freshman Ohio senator.\n\nTrump unveiled Vance as his veep pick last week as the Republican National Convention got underway in Milwaukee. The two campaigned together over the weekend and plan to do so again this coming weekend in Minnesota.\n\nTrump rally attendees suffer heat stress\n\nParamedics received eight calls about people suffering from heat stress at the arena in Charlotte, North Carolina, where attendees waited outside for hours in the sweltering heat before being allowed inside to hear the former president speak Wednesday.\n\nAt least two people were taken to a hospital, according to the Mecklenburg Emergency Medical Services Agency.\n\nTemperatures in Charlotte were near 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius) and high humidity made it feel several degrees warmer on the pavement surrounding the 8,600-seat Bojangles Coliseum.\n\nPolice remove Palestinian flags at Union Station\n\nPolice have taken down Palestinian flags that protesters hoisted outside Washington's Union Station. Protesters removed three American flags from the poles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. At least one of the American flags was burned. Police took down the Palestinian flags once the crowd began to dissipate.\n\nAccess to Union Station locked down\n\nAmtrak Police locked down access to Union Station around 3:30 p.m. ET, closing all but one entrance to the major transportation hub.\n\nIn a message on X, formerly known as Twitter, the Virginia Railway Express notified passengers they would be required to show their tickets to get into the station, via the First Street Metrorail entrance.\n\nTempers flare outside Union Station as police officers take people into custody\n\nAn Associated Press reporter saw at least four people taken into custody by police during the confrontation outside Union Station. Protesters repeatedly shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers.\n\nOne person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer grabbed a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossed it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nSen. Kelly: 'Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas'\n\nSen. Mark Kelly said that Netanyahu expressed \"a lot of things that many Americans are feeling,\" but also wished the prime minister had acknowledged the loss of life during the war. \"Every Palestinian in Gaza is not a member of Hamas.\"\n\nNetanyahu mentioned notifying civilians, Kelly said, but there have been a lot of civilian casualties, and there are always ways to improve. \"It's important to recognize that,\" he said.\n\nOver 39,000 Palestinians have been killed and another 89,800 have been wounded during Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nHostage supporters gathered in Tel Aviv to watch Netanyahu speech, demand 'deal now'\n\nIn Tel Aviv, hundreds of relatives of Israeli hostages and other supporters gathered in the city's \"Hostages Square\" to watch the speech on a large screen.\n\nMany chanted \"Deal now\" as he spoke.\n\n\"I want to tell my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, my grandfather could have been alive today with us. He was waiting for someone to come and save him. He was waiting for you to seal the deal,\" said Talya Dancyg, whose grandfather, Alex Dancyg, was pronounced dead in captivity this week by Israeli authorities.\n\n\"Seal the deal. Bring them home now,\" she said.\n\n\"If he didn't open with the words, 'we have a deal,' I don't care what he has to say,\" added Sharon Kalderon, sister-in-law of hostage Ofer Kalderon.\n\nProtesters graffiti monument, disperse\n\nProtesters have spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus outside Union Station, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. At the base, the words \"Free Gaza\" are painted in green.\n\nWith the announcement over a megaphone that \"the police are coming\" many protestors appeared to disperse.\n\n... But Democrats have had a more mixed response\n\n1. Rep, Brad Schneider of Illinois, a Jewish Democrat and staunch Israel supporter said, \"There's a lot of times this could have turned in different directions,\" expressing gratitude the speech was not partisan. \"Did I agree with everything he said? No, but no one has spoken on this floor that I have agreed with everything they've said.\"\n\n2. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said she agreed with Netanyahu that the priority is getting the hostages out also acknowledged the importance of a cease-fire. \"And then there is no question Hamas has to be removed from power. I agree with that, but I don't agree that anyone who is protesting their strategy on war in Michigan are people who support Hamas.\"\n\n3. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut left dissatisfied, saying Netanyahu visited the U.S. and was \"very clearly aligning himself with a host of messaging from Republicans,\" which he called unsurprising but also \"really, really sad.\" Murphy said the speech was a lot of \"war-sloganeering, and not much thoughtful, detailed explanation of how he's going to keep Israel safe in the long run.\"\n\nRepublicans have widely praised Netanyahu's speech ...\n\n4. Sen. Dan Sullivan of Alaska, \"The most important thing I think he did is lay out the stakes as it relates to Iran. That's where Democrats and Republicans should agree. It is Iran behind everything, and he did a great job of laying that out.\"\n\n5. Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said Netanyahu \"provided a stark reminder of what's at stake not just for the region but for us.\"\n\n6. Republican House Leader Steve Scalise called the speech \"moving\" and said it allowed Congress to \"see the cost of the war, to see what's at stake, why they're fighting and why they must win, and why it's important for the United States to stand with them.\"\n\n7. Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky, \"Why should members of Congress, why should the American people defend Israel in their moment of need? Because it is in the national security interest of the United States to defeat Hamas and other Iranian proxies.\"\n\nUS Rep. Jamie Raskin criticizes Netanyahu's speech as one made for Trump's GOP\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, said Netanyahu's speech was made for Trump's GOP\n\n\"It's too bad he couldn't have come earlier in the summer. He could have given it at the Republican National Convention because the speech was really pitched to right-wing Americans, for a right-wing approach to the war and that's been rejected.\"\n\nRaskin, who met with families of hostages earlier in the day, said he heard no plan from Netanyahu for their safe return and an end to the war.\n\n\"We didn't hear anything about meaningful progress towards a bilateral cease-fire in return for hostages. We didn't hear anything about peace. We didn't hear anything about a two-state solution, which has been U.S. foreign policy for decades,\" he said.\"You had one narcissistic, indicted right-wing autocrat coming over here to speak to the followers of another narcissistic, right-wing, autocrat.\"\n\n'Palestine will be free'\n\nProtesters cheered as a fire burned what appeared to be a paper-mache likeness of Netanyahu.\n\nThe replica of the Liberty Bell outside the station has been covered in graffiti reading \"Free Palestine\" and in Arabic \"Palestine will be free.\"\n\nOfficers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields are walking in a line down a street outside Union Station.\n\nAll 3 US flags at Union Station replaced with Palestinian flags\n\nProtesters have climbed the flagpole outside Washington's Union Station and replaced the American flags outside with Palestinian flags. Dozens of law enforcement officers remain outside Union Station, which is one of the nation's busiest railroad terminals.\n\nCheers rang out as the final flag was raised.\n\nPolice deploy chemical agent at protestors\n\nAfter being turned away by police near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of Union Station.\n\nWhen protestors took down one of the giant U.S. flags outside, police moved in. At least one person was arrested and police deployed chemical agents.\n\nProtesters chanted \"shame on you\" as police dragged somebody away. At least two people were seen being treated for chemical agent effects on the eyes.\n\n'I came here to thank you, America,' Netanyahu says as he wraps speech\n\n\"On behalf of the people of Israel, I came here to say thank you, America,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday as he finished his address to Congress.\n\nDemocrats subsequently filed out of the chamber while Republicans were still giving the prime minister enthusiastic applause.\n\nNetanyahu praises Trump\n\nThe Israeli leader, frequently accused of wading into American politics in favor of Republicans, lavished praise on former president and current presidential contender Donald Trump \"for all he's done for Israel.\"\n\n'Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities\n\nNetanyahu says he is ready to press forward with Israel's war against Hamas until he achieves \"total victory.\"\n\nNetanyahu told Congress that he would agree to a cease-fire if Hamas surrenders, disarms and releases all hostages it is holding.\n\n\"Israel will fight until we destroy Hamas' military capabilities and its rule in Gaza and bring all our hostages home,\" he said. \"That's what total victory means. And we will settle for nothing less.\"\n\nBut he said Israel would continue to fight indefinitely until it destroys the group's military capabilities and brings home all hostages.\n\nCritics have said Netanyahu's vow of total victory is unrealistic, as Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas that the Israeli military has withdrawn from.\n\nU.S.-led cease-fire talks have dragged on for months without a breakthrough.\n\nA tense scene between dueling protestors\n\nAt one point, late in the march, a brief scuffle broke out between different protest groups. At the corner of D Street and Delaware, a small group waving Israeli flags had set up a demonstration, claiming to be pro-Israel but anti-Netanyahu.\n\nAs the main rally passed them, one man tried to grab the megaphone held by one of the pro-Israeli protesters.\n\nThe pair separated after a brief struggle and the situation devolved into multiple tense, but nonviolent, debates.\n\nPeople wearing yellow 'Seal the deal now' T-shirts removed\n\nEarlier in the speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the House gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages.\n\nThe individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nArrests made in House Gallery, per Capitol Police\n\nU.S. Capitol Police say they have arrested five people who disrupted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress. Police said in a post on X that the people were in the House Gallery and were \"immediately removed\" and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the Congressional Buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nThe affiliation of those arrested is not immediately clear.\n\nNetanyahu's speech takes on more combative tone\n\nNetanyahu's speech took on a more combative tone as he defended his country but also derided those protesting the war in Gaza, gesturing to demonstrations happening as he spoke on the streets outside the U.S. Capitol, as \"useful idiots\" for Israel's adversaries.\n\n\"The hands of the Jewish state will never be shackled,\" he said.\n\nHe drew shouts of applause from many in Congress, but also silence from leading Democrats who declined to stand and cheer.\n\nA common thread of Netanyahu's speech is painting Israel's fight against Hamas and the region as a whole as synonymous with American interests and values.\n\nRNC chairman says the party's electoral strategy has not changed following Harris' ascension\n\nThe head of the RNC says his party's general election calculus has not changed now that Democrats may be led by Harris and not President Biden.\n\nRNC Chairman Michael Whatley told The Associated Press ahead of Trump's rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, later today that he feels \"fantastic\" about his candidate's chances in the state, which was the scene of Trump's slimmest electoral victory in 2020.\n\nWhatley also said that he felt Vance's addition to the ticket would resonate with voters in North Carolina.\n\nAsked about running a campaign against Harris instead of Biden, Whatley expressed confidence in his notion that Trump \"has more energy and is doing more events than any presidential candidate, ever. Nobody is going to outwork Donald Trump.\"\n\nWhatley was serving as chairman of the North Carolina GOP when Trump put him forth as his pick to lead national Republicans.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib holds up sign that says 'war criminal' and 'guilty of genocide'\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, held up a sign in the House chamber Wednesday that said \"war criminal\" on one side and \"guilty of genocide\" on the other.\n\nTlaib has been one of Netanyahu's most strident critics in Congress and was censured for her comments last year about the latest Israel-Hamas war.\n\nShe has relatives in the West Bank and represents a district in Michigan with many Palestinians.\n\nNetanyahu thanks Biden for his efforts and 'hearfelt support for Israel'\n\nNetanyahu on Wednesday said Biden stood with Israel in his darkest hour and it will \"never be forgotten.\"\n\n\"I want to thank him for half a century of friendship to Israel,\" he said.\n\nMany had expected Netanyahu to use his address before Congress to once again criticize the Democratic president but the prime minister's remarks so far have been complimentary and gracious to President Joe Biden, who stepped down days ago as the Democratic nominee for president, for \"half a century of friendship to Israel.\"\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray on protesters near US Capitol\n\nPolice deployed pepper spray Wednesday as a large crowd protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched toward the U.S. Capitol, where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking to Congress.\n\nThousands of protesters descended on Washington, chanting \"Free, Free Palestine\" as some tried to block streets ahead of Netanyahu's speech. Police wearing gas marks blocked the crowd, which was calling for an end to the war that has killed more than 39,000 Palestinians, from getting closer to the Capitol.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police said in a post on X that some members of the crowd had become \"violent\" and had \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\n\"We are deploying pepper spray toward anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nNetanyahu begins speech to Congress\n\n\"For the forces of civilization to triumph, America and Israel must stand together,\" Netanyahu said. \"When we stand together something really great happens: we win, they lose.\n\nHe wore a pin with Israeli and U.S. flags on one side, and a yellow pin expressing solidarity with the Israeli hostages held by Hamas.\n\nMore than 50 congressional Dems absent from Netanyahu's address\n\nBy the time Netanyahu was set to begin his address before a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, more than fifty congressional Democrats were noticeably absent after announcing publicly that they would not be attending the speech in protest of the prime minister's handling of the war.\n\nProtesters gather outside US Embassy in Tel Aviv ahead of Netanyahu's speech\n\nProtests were also taking place in Israel ahead of Netanyahu's speech, with demonstrators demanding a cease-fire in exchange for the release of the roughly 120 hostages still held by Hamas. About 200 protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy Branch Office in Tel Aviv, some holding signs reading \"Bibi, enemy of Israel,\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname.\n\nUS Rep. Tlaib among those attending Netanyahu's address\n\nWhile many Democrats declined to attend the prime minister's speech as a way to protest how Netanyahu has led the war against Hamas, one outspoken critic of his conduct is attending.\n\nU.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, took a seat in the House chamber with a keffiyeh, which she often wears, wrapped over her shoulders. Tlaib was censured last year for her strident criticism of Israel's conduct in the war.\n\nNetanyahu arrives on Capitol Hill, greets House Speaker Johnson\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has arrived on Capitol Hill and has greeted House Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\n\"We are certainly happy to welcome our friend,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Today and every day America must stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Speaker Johnson, you have shown great leadership,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThe two men spoke briefly, podiums side by side, at the Capitol.\n\n'We are not playing around,' Harris tells gathering of historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta members\n\nVice President Kamala Harris told a gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis on Wednesday that \"we are not playing around,\" in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAnd she asked them for their support in helping to elect her.\n\nHarris said: \"In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation -- one focused on the future, the other focused on the past.\n\n\"And with your support, I am fighting for our nation's future.\"\n\nVoters in Indiana haven't backed a Democratic presidential candidate in nearly 16 years. But the biennial meeting of roughly 6,000 people, mostly women, is part of a constituency Harris hopes will turn out for her in massive numbers: women of color.\n\nPresident Joe Biden stepped away from the race on Sunday.\n\nFamily membersof Israeli hostages criticize Netanyahu's trip to the US\n\nAt an event with dozens of Democrats ahead of Netanyahu's speech, several family members of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas last year unleashed criticism at the prime minister for coming to the U.S. when he could be focused on securing a deal to free those taken captive.\n\n\"The hostage family forum back home urged Netanyahu not to come here and give this speech now at a time when a deal is so close,\" said Maya Roman, who had several family members taken hostage. \"Because by coming here, he risks making himself the issue, turning the humanitarian issue of the hostages into a political one.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, called the event a \"powerful\" reminder of the importance of reaching a cease-fire deal and returning the hostages.\n\n\"It's painful for them to have Netanyahu here in Washington kind of promoting himself when their loved ones are still being held hostage,\" he said.\n\nVance labels Harris an out-of-touch 'career politician'\n\nTrump's VP pick is characterizing Harris, his running mate's possible November opponent, as an out-of-touch \"career politician.\"\n\n\"What has she ever done for this country?\" Vance asked conservative activist and host Charlie Kirk in a podcast interview Wednesday.\n\nThe 39-year-old Vance, who has begun hitting the campaign trail both solo and with Trump in recent days, also argued that his addition to the GOP ticket can help appeal to young voters.\n\n\"If you're a young voter in this economy with interest rates skyrocketing how can you possibly afford to buy a house?\" Vance said. \"If you want to turn the page on that ... you've got to vote for President Trump.\"\n\nVance said he sees the two top issues as the economy and U.S.-Mexico border, on both of which he argued that Biden -- and now Harris -- are not succeeding.\n\n\"I think we have to make a substantive argument that the Kamala Harris-Joe Biden agenda has failed for this country,\" Vance said. \"Do we want four years even worse than the last four years?\"\n\nSenate Republicans criticize Harris over absence from Netanyahu's address before Congress\n\nSenate Republicans are criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address today before a joint session of Congress.\n\nHarris is in Indianapolis where she's speaking to the historically Black Zeta Phi Beta sorority's biennial convention. She is set to hold private talks with Netanyahu at the White House later this week.\n\nThe vice president is the presiding officer of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker. But there have been other instances in recent history when the vice president has skipped such addresses by foreign leaders because of scheduling conflicts.\n\n\"She should be here whether she likes the prime minister of Israel or not, whether she respects him or not, she should be here,\" said Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, who organized a press conference with fellow Senate Republicans that largely focused on Harris' absence from the speech.\"It is a disgrace.\"\n\nSen. JD Vance, the Republican vice president nominee, is also skipping the speech to campaign.\n\n\"He's not the sitting vice president of the United States,\" Ernst said.\n\n2 Senate committees will hold a hearing next week on the assassination attempt on Trump\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin announced the hearing on the Senate floor Wednesday, saying that the Judiciary panel will hold the joint hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\nHe said the committees will conduct a bipartisan investigation into the shooting.\n\nThe panels will hear from the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI, Durbin said, and they will also have a closed-door classified briefing. Witnesses have not yet been announced.\n\nMother of Israeli hostage slams delaying of negotiating team to cease-fire talks\n\nThe mother of an Israeli held hostage by Hamas in Gaza has slammed the delay of the Israeli negotiating team to cease-fire talks.\n\n\"Instead of announcing in Congress that he agrees to the deal on the table, Netanyahu is preventing the deal's fruition because of personal considerations. Even if we hear of more hostages who died in the tunnels, he will continue his PR mission in the U.S. and will continue to drag his feet,\" said Einav Zangauker, who has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu throughout the war. Her son Matan was taken hostage on Oct. 7.\n\nCease-fire negotiating team that was meant to depart has been delayed, Israeli official says\n\nAn Israeli official said Wednesday that a negotiating team meant to depart to continue cease-fire talks was delayed.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss developments in the sensitive talks, did not give a reason for the delay, saying the team would likely be dispatched next week.\n\nMore than 60 congressional Dems gather at the Capitol with families of Israeli hostages\n\nIn the bowels of the U.S. Capitol, a group of more than 60 congressional Democrats gathered with the families of Israeli hostages to bring light to their months of captivity and increase pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government to abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement that the U.S. is helping broker.\n\nThe event was marketed as alternative planning for Democrats who didn't want to attend Netanyahu's address to Congress later Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"It is my hope that the Prime Minister will listen to you, will listen to the families and to the countless Americans who love and who support Israel and want to see a negotiated end to the fighting that makes an enduring peace possible,\" said U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, a senior Democrat who is boycotting the address.\n\nProtestors demand Netanyahu's arrest\n\nZeina Hutchinson, director of development for the Arab American Anti-Discrimination Committee, on Wednesday read off the names of several Palestinian journalists killed by the Israeli military.\n\n\"We protest this homicidal maniac, his supporters and his enablers,\" she shouted from the stage, referencing Netanyahu. \"And we demand his arrest.\"\n\nShe was among hundreds who gathered to protest near the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore than 1,000protestors line Pennsylvania Avenue\n\nMore than 1,000 people gathered Wednesday morning on Pennsylvania Avenue within sight of the U.S. Capitol building, with more streaming in from multiple directions.\n\nProtesters carried signs branding Netanyahu a \"war criminal\" and several erected a large effigy of Biden with blood dripping from its mouth and devil horns.\n\nThe crowd chanted: \"Biden Biden, you can't hide/We charge you with genocide.\"\n\nThis report has been corrected to show that the effigy was of Biden, not Netanyahu.\n\nNetanyahu focuses on Iran in remarks at memorial for Joe Lieberman\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday pointed to Iran as the force \"behind an entire axis of terror\" threatening the United States and Israel.\n\nNetanyahu used brief remarks at a memorial for the late lawmaker Joe Lieberman to focus on what the Israeli leader portrayed as danger from Iran and its nuclear program.\n\nNetanyahu long has sought to rally support for more aggressive U.S. and Israeli action against Iran, its militia allies around the Middle East and its nuclear program. His comments at the memorial are likely to foreshadow the theme of the Israeli leader's remarks to a joint meeting of Congress later Wednesday.\n\nLieberman, who died in March, \"knew how dangerous our world would become if Iran were ever to develop and acquire nuclear weapons,\" Netanyahu said. The two men often discussed \"how Iran was behind the entire axis of terror that threatened both our countries.\"\n\nProtestors: 'As American Jews, we don't support this war'\n\nAcross the street from Union Station in Washington, D.C., Jewish Americans gathered Wednesday morning for a prayer service led by T'ruah, an organization of rabbis calling for a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nRabbi Bill Plevan, of New York, said he believed prayer could be a catalyst for peace.\n\n\"We're here to protest Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech in Congress,\" he said. \"We're here to say we don't stand by his policies. As American Jews, we don't support this war.\"\n\nStill, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nThe scene near the Capitol\n\nWorkers erected a black metal fence around the White House as Washington braced for protests ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before a joint session of Congress.\n\nMultiple protests were planned for Wednesday over Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nThere was a heavy police presence, but the streets were relatively quiet in Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning. A small group of protesters walked down a street carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"anti-Israel is not anti-semitism.\"\n\nWithin view of the Capitol, orthodox Jews lined the streets protesting Netanyahu and the war.\n\nAs police sirens sounded in the distance, protesters carried signs that included \"Jews Worldwide Condemn Israeli Bloody Brutality\" and \"Free Palestine.\" Another called for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nDespite some of the people and groups who were protesting, many Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came as a response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loved ones.\n\nSenators re-up calls for Biden and US negotiators to close cease-fire deal\n\nHours before Netanyahu was set to arrive, the Senate chairmen of the national security committees sent a letter to President Joe Biden, reupping calls for him and U.S. negotiators to quickly close the cease-fire deal that would end the conflict in Gaza and force the release of the hostages.\n\n\"We are under no illusion that this will be easy and we fully understand that diplomacy requires compromise. But the pre-October 7 status quo is not sustainable,\" Sens. Ben Cardin, Jack Reed and Mark Warner wrote Wednesday.\n\nMarianne Williamson seeks Democratic delegate support for open convention\n\nAuthor Marianne Williamson has sent a letter to Democratic delegates seeking their support ahead of their formal presidential nominating process.\n\nWilliamson asks delegates to sign her petition and \"consider taking a stand for an open convention,\" according to a copy of the missive shared with The Associated Press. The note also includes a link for anyone wishing to submit Williamson's name for nomination.\n\nDemocrats have indicated that they will hold a virtual roll call vote by Aug. 7 to name their chosen nominee, ahead of the convention that begins 12 days later in Chicago.\n\nThat process will be open to any candidate who musters 300 signatures from delegates elected to the convention.\n\nAn AP survey of Democratic delegates indicates that Harris has secured commitments from enough of them to become her party's nominee.\n\nWilliamson challenged Biden for the nomination and suspended her campaign, but reversed herself earlier this year.\n\nBiden's speech tonight hopes to make a case for his legacy -- and for Harris to continue it\n\nBiden will have an opportunity to make a case for his legacy -- sweeping domestic legislation, renewal of alliances abroad, defense of democracy -- tonight at 8 p.m. ET. when he delivers an Oval Office address about his decision to bow out of the race and \"what lies ahead.\"\n\nEven though the president won't be on the ballot this November, voters still will be weighing his legacy. As Vice President Kamala Harris moves to take his place as the Democratic standard-bearer, Biden's accomplishments remain very much at risk should Republican Donald Trump prevail.\n\nHow Biden's single term -- and his decision to step aside -- are remembered will be intertwined with Harris' electoral success in November, particularly as the vice president runs tightly on the achievements of the Biden administration.\n\nAnd no matter how frustrated Biden is at being pushed aside by his party -- and he's plenty upset -- he has too much at stake simply to wash his hands of this election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more on what to expect ahead of the address\n\nProtests planned around Capitol Hill\n\nMultiple protests are planned outside the Capitol, with some condemning the Israeli military campaign overall, and others expressing support for Israel but pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal and bring home hostages.\n\nThe largest protest is set for this morning, with organizers planning to march around the Capitol building demanding Netanyahu's arrest on war crimes charges. A permit application submitted to the National Park Service estimated at least 5,000 participants.\n\n\u25b6 What to know about Netanyahu's visit\n\nGOP leaders urge colleagues to steer clear of racist and sexist attacks on Harris\n\nRepublican leaders are warning party members against using overtly racist and sexist attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris, as they and former President Donald Trump 's campaign scramble to adjust to the reality of a new Democratic rival less than four months before Election Day.\n\nAt a closed-door meeting of House Republicans on Tuesday, National Republican Congressional Committee chairman Richard Hudson, R-N.C., urged lawmakers to stick to criticizing Harris for her role in Biden-Harris administration policies.\n\n\"This election will be about policies and not personalities,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the meeting.\n\n\"This is not personal with regard to Kamala Harris,\" he added, \"and her ethnicity or her gender have nothing to do with this whatsoever.\"\n\nTrump expected to turn his full focus on Harris at first rally since Biden's exit\n\nDonald Trump is holding his first public campaign rally since President Joe Biden dropped out of a 2024 matchup that both major parties had spent months preparing for, leaving the former president to direct his ire toward his likely new opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHarris spoke toa roaring crowd of battleground state voters in Wisconsin yesterday\n\nA roaring crowd of battleground state voters greeted Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday as she opened her public case against Republican former President Donald Trump by declaring November's election will be \"a choice between freedom and chaos.\"\n\nHarris arrived in the Milwaukee area having locked up nomination support from Democratic delegates after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid on Sunday. It was her first campaign rally since she jumped into the race just two days ago with Biden's endorsement.\n\nThe event reflected a vibrancy that had been lacking among Democrats in recent weeks, and Harris was intent on projecting a sense of steady confidence about the November election.\n\n\u25b6 Read more about why the event in Wisconsin matters for Harris' campaign\n\nHarris campaign sees multiple ways for her to win, ahead of vice president speaking in Indiana\n\nJust three full days since entering the race after President Joe Biden's departure, Kamala Harris will address the annual gathering of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta in Indianapolis.\n\nIt's a moment for Harris, a woman of Black and South Asian descent, to speak to a group already excited by her historic status as the likely Democratic nominee and one that her campaign believes can help to expand its coalition.\n\nHarris, Trump are on the campaign trail as Biden prepares to address the nation\n\nVice President Kamala Harris goes to the solidly Republican state of Indiana later today, but she plans to speak there to a key Democratic constituency as her campaign sees advantages with women, Black, Latino, Asian and younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Joe Biden will address the nation from the Oval Office tonight on his decision to drop his 2024 Democratic reelection bid.\n\nDemocrats release more proposals for how they will formally choose a presidential nominee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee has released proposed rules that would give candidates until next week to vie for the party's nomination. But the process will almost certainly end with Vice President Harris replacing President Biden at the top of the party's ticket.\n\nCandidates will have to qualify by the evening of July 30, according to draft rules released Tuesday.\n\nThe party previously announced proposed rules requiring that candidates submit electronic signatures of support from at least 300 delegates to its national convention, no more than 50 of which can be from a single state.\n\nIf multiple candidates qualify, it could spark multiple rounds of voting over several days. But, if Harris is the only candidate, voting would be set to begin Aug. 1. The party said last week that it would not hold voting prior to the start of next month and that the process would be completed by Aug. 7.\n\nBiden endorsed Harris when he left the race Sunday and no other major Democrat has announced plans to challenge her. An AP survey of delegates from states across the country found that she had already exceeded the threshold of support needed to secure the nomination.\n\nFamilies of Israeli hostages gather for a vigil on the National Mall\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nAbout 150 people wearing yellow shirts that read \"Seal the Deal NOW!\" chanted \"Bring Them Home\" and listened to testimonials from relatives and former hostages. The demonstrators applauded when Biden's name was mentioned, but several criticized Netanyahu -- known by his nickname \"Bibi\" -- on the belief that he has been dragging his feet or playing hardball on a proposed cease-fire deal that would return all of the hostages.\n\n\"I'm begging Bibi. There's a deal on the table and you have to take it,\" said Aviva Siegel, 63, who spent 51 days in captivity and whose husband Keith remains a hostage. \"I want Bibi to look in my eyes and tell me one thing: that Keith is coming home.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In an address to the nation at the Resolute Desk, surrounded by his family, Mr Biden did his best to write himself into the history of the nation.\n\nIn just 10 minutes, he cited three of America's founding fathers and quoted from both the Declaration of Independence and the preamble to the US Constitution.\n\nBut it was his reference to George Washington, America's first president, that felt most deliberate.\n\n\"George Washington showed us presidents are not kings,\" he said, later adding: \"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule. The people do.\"\n\nMr Biden wants America to remember him, like Washington, as a leader who stepped back for the good of the people.\n\n\"The defence of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title,\" he said.\n\nUnlike Washington, however, Mr Biden did not make this evidently painful decision of his own accord. The choice to end his campaign came after weeks of calls for him to step back and \"pass the torch\".\n\nUntil it became clear that senior Democrats would go public with their concerns, he clung to the nomination and refused to leave.\n\nNor did Mr Biden step back because he was concerned, like Washington, about becoming an all-powerful ruler.\n\nIn fact, the opposite is true. He ended his campaign when it became clear he was too weak and unpopular to win another election against Trump, and too frail to command the support of the American public.\n\nAmid his rhetoric about the protection of democracy, there was a hint of reluctance in the elderly president's words to the nation.\n\n\"I believe my record as president, my leadership in the world, my vision for America's future, all merited a second term, but nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy,\" he said.\n\nThat record was laid out for the country, and for the history books, by Mr Biden himself as he prepared to fade into the background of this campaign.\n\nHe cited his work on the Covid pandemic, his flagship \"Bidenomics\" policies and his appointment of the first Black woman as a justice at the Supreme Court.\n\nAmid calls from Republicans for him to stand down immediately, he also stressed he would continue his work on Nato, crime reduction and battling illegal migration for his remaining months in office.\n\nThe truth, as Mr Biden knows, is that this was the last truly significant speech of his life.\n\nHis 1500-word address was crammed with the names of notable presidents he now hopes to join in the highlights of his country's history, and his elegant description of a nation of \"dreamers and doers\" was written more for Americans of the future than his present countrymen.\n\nHis final legacy, of course, will be the result of this year's election. If Kamala Harris cannot win back Trump's lead, handing him a second term in office, Mr Biden will be blamed.\n\nIf she wins, he will be hailed as a president who did the right thing when he realised he was beaten.

He acknowledged that voters didn't seem to agree, though, that he was on a path to lose in November to an opponent he says would endanger democracy itself. \"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy. That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nHis words were poignant, his manner somber. But the low timbre of his voice and his occasional stumble over the words he was reading from a teleprompter were reminders of the concerns about his age that had undermined his bid for a second term.\n\n\"I have decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation,\" Biden, 81, said in an echo of John F. Kennedy's inaugural address. He called it \"a time for new voices, for fresh voices, yes, for younger voices.\"\n\nBiden had announced on Sunday that he would become the first president since 1968 to choose not to run for another term. But his diagnosis with COVID, and the isolation that followed at his vacation home in Delaware, delayed the speech for four days - a speech that he didn't want to give.\n\nThat delay inadvertently underscored how quickly the attention of the country is moving on from Biden's tenure to the fierce battle between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump to succeed him. His announcement energized Democratic voters, fueled record-setting campaign donations, and almost instantly united the party behind his replacement.\n\nThere's still time for him to make a difference, Biden said.\n\n\"Over the next six months I will be focused on doing my job as President,\" he said. He said he would battle gun violence, call for Supreme Court reform, press efforts to end cancer, keep NATO powerful and united, work to end the war in Gaza and more.\n\nBut the prospects for passing significant legislation through a Republican-controlled House in the next few months is dim. While lame-duck presidents often turn to foreign policy as territory where they can still exert influence, his power to pressure foreign leaders will be complicated by their interest in and calculations about the contenders to lead the next administration.\n\nHe endorsed Harris on Sunday, and he praised her in his speech as experienced, tough and capable.\n\nFor Biden, the durability of his legacy is now in her hands.\n\nHarris' election in November would ratify the wisdom of Biden stepping back, even belatedly, and put in office a successor with a consistent agenda and commitment to preserving his achievements.\n\nBut her defeat this fall would fuel blame aimed at Biden for his decision last year to seek a second term, despite concerns about his age from the start. It would put back in power Trump, who has mocked and derided Biden's agenda and vowed to dismantle it.\n\nIt was just the fourth time Biden had addressed the nation from the Oval Office, a more solemn venue than the sunlight and greenery of the Rose Garden.\n\nBiden had used the Oval Office for a speech just three times before to speak to the American people - first at a time of triumph, when the Fiscal Responsibility Act had finally passed in June 2023. Then on two more calamitous occasions, to discuss the Israeli-Gaza conflict four months later, and just 10 days ago to address the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.\n\nPresident Lyndon Johnson already had delivered messages from behind his desk 26 times - on topics from race riots on U.S. streets to bombing campaigns in Southeast Asia - when he scheduled an Oval Office address in March 1968 to talk about the Vietnam war.\n\nTo the astonishment of even some close aides, LBJ closed the 40-minute address by announcing he would devote the rest of his term to seeking peace, not another term. \"Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president,\" he said.\n\nBiden's speech was shorter, and his message didn't come as a surprise. Like LBJ, though, he vowed to pursue big goals in his final months in the White House.\n\nHistory isn't encouraging when it comes to big ambitions for lame ducks.\n\nEven the phrase \"lame duck\" doesn't sound promising - literally, a duck with a game leg, a target for predators because he can't keep up with the rest of the flock. The phrase was coined in the 18th century at the London Stock Exchange to describe a stockbroker who defaulted on his debts, then was adapted to American politics in the 19th century.\n\nJohnson in 1968 was unable to achieve his stated goal of achieving peace in Vietnam; that was left to successor Richard Nixon. Harry Truman as a lame duck in 1952 tried and failed to end the war in Korea; that was achieved by successor Dwight Eisenhower. Bill Clinton's intensive efforts at a Camp David summit to reach a comprehensive agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians came close but fell short.\n\nThe exception was George W. Bush, who in the final months of his tenure in 2008 faced a financial crisis and was forced to back a huge bank bailout that most of his own party opposed.\n\nNot the legacy he wanted, either.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of John F.

Even though the president had the personal ambition to run again, he understood, with piercing clarity, that the White House carried stakes that transcended his burning conviction that he could win in the November presidential election.\n\n\"It's been the honor of my life to serve as your president,\" he said from the Oval Office, \"but defending democracy, which is at stake, I think it's more important than any title.\"\n\n\"I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation.\"\n\nThe remarks, heartfelt and unifying in tone, appeared to succinctly punctuate a decades-long career devoted to public office. Biden continued by praising Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he had endorsed to replace him on the presidential ticket, calling Harris \"tough\" and \"an incredible partner.\" He also framed Harris as deeply consequential to maintaining US democracy.\n\n\"We have to decide: do we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice, and democracy? In this moment, can we see those we disagree with not as enemies but as fellow Americans? Can we do that? Does character in public life still matter?\"\n\nThe prime-time address offered a sharp contrast from the dark and menacing message Donald Trump and his allies, including his running mate JD Vance, have offered to American voters over the last week -- even with Trump's brief attempt to appear to be a more unifying character since his assassination attempt.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here, kings and dictators do not rule; the people do,\" Biden said on Wednesday. \"History is in your hands.

That includes personal ambition.\"\n\nThe speech was the president's first public comments since passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee. He did not dwell on the concerns about his age or health that caused him to relent to pressure from within his own party after a listless and halting debate performance.\n\nInstead, he pledged to continue working on foreign and domestic policy, seeking to advance his agenda even as a lame duck president for the next 180 days. He said of Harris that she is \"experienced, she's tough; she's capable\" and urged voters to pick her over former President Donald Trump.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nBiden's future: The president still has six months -- or roughly an eighth of his term -- to cement his legacy and assist Harris on the campaign trail. Traditionally, a lame-duck president -- one who is assuredly on his way out of office -- is in a frustrating position, with fewer opportunities to pass major legislation or capture the attention of the public. But Biden has already vowed that he's \"not going anywhere,\" declaring that he will continue to advance his own agenda until January.\n\nTrump assails Harris: Trump called Harris a \"radical-left lunatic\" who would destroy the country in his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out. Repeatedly mispronouncing her first name and calling her \"Lyin' Kamala,\" Trump accused her of helping conceal what he described as Biden's unfitness for the presidency and falsely claimed she had \"headed up\" the four criminal cases against him.\n\nHarris' fast start: Harris continued an energetic sprint around the country, blasting Trump as a candidate who wants to return America to a \"dark past,\" with cuts to Medicare and the elimination of the Education Department and popular programs like Head Start. At an appearance in Indianapolis a day after her first rally in Milwaukee, she repeated her vow that \"we are not going back.

It was a sad, sluggish ending to a life in politics, decades in the Senate, two terms as vice president, and finally a single term as president.\n\nPresident Biden needed to accomplish three things in the speech:\n\nHe certainly promoted Harris and indirectly attacked Donald Trump, effectively calling him a threat to democracy. But he did nothing to explain why he withdrew from the race and nothing to convince a worried country that he was still fit to serve as president.\n\nHe didn't even try to explain why he withdrew. He simply quoted John F. Kennedy's inaugural speech that it \"was time to pass the torch a new generation.\" But quoting JFK doesn't explain why Joe suddenly reached that epiphany last weekend, rather than a year ago, before he chose to run and cleared the field of other Democratic candidates. What changed? Biden's speech evaded the question.\n\nThere are lots of plausible answers. It might have been his catastrophic debate performance, which convinced many Americans that he no longer had the cognitive capacity to lead the country. It might have been his dismal poll numbers, the lowest of any president since modern polling began (even before the debate performance). It might have been polling in swing states, which showed he was unlikely to win the electoral votes he needs. It might have been the intense pressure from elected Democrats and unhappy donors, some of it in public, much of it behind closed doors.\n\nThe best reporting says Biden didn't jump, he was pushed. He was ousted in a back-room coup, led by Nancy Pelosi and Barack Obama. We still don't know which carrots and sticks they used to convince Biden to step down. Reports are that Pelosi told Biden, \"We can do this the easy way, or we can do it the hard way.\" We don't know what \"the hard way\" was, but we do know the former speaker of the House was working the phones aggressively to remove Biden. She gave him a couple of weeks to do it the easy way -- and he resisted ferociously.\n\nThen, over the weekend, Biden caved. We don't know why. His press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, said it was not a health problem. He's perfectly fine, she said, an answer that continues the cover-up about Biden's condition the White House has maintained for months. But if poor health wasn't the reason, then what was? Biden won't say. He certainly didn't in his Oval Office speech.\n\nBiden's health wasn't just a reelection problem. It's a governing problem now. His frailty raises serious questions about whether he is fit to serve until mid-January 2025. It is not correct to say, as many Republicans do, that if he is not fit to serve another four years, then he is not fit to serve now. It is possible to be healthy enough to serve now but doubtful about the future.\n\nBiden needed to address these health issues, but made no effort to do so. None. Polls show most Americans are genuinely concerned about the president's fail health and cognitive decline and wonder if he can continue leading the country for another four and half months. Indeed, they wonder if he is really running things now and, if he isn't, who is? Biden's brief speech won't reassure them. Although he didn't make any major gaffes, he hardly gave a strong performance. He simply read the teleprompter in a soft, gravelly voice for eleven minutes and said he would continue to serve.\n\nThe most forceful portion of the speech was its partisan conclusion, which was less about Kamala Harris and more about the looming \"threat to democracy\" -- and we all know who Biden meant. He never mentioned Donald Trump's name, but he was the obvious target. Even when he condemned political violence, Biden refused to mention the assassination attempt on Trump.\n\nGenerosity was not the theme of the speech. The theme was that he had saved our union from Trump and that the threat was the central issue of this campaign. Without ever mentioning Trump's name, he told the nation that failing to elect Kamala Harris would endanger our democracy. The country was at \"an inflection point,\" he said, before stumbling through Benjamin Franklin's famous quote about our form of government. As Franklin exited the Continental Congress, a woman asked him whether we had a monarchy or republic. \"A republic,\" he replied, \"if you can keep it.\"\n\nFranklin was right that our republic must be sustained, not taken for granted and allowed to decay, to be replaced by tyranny. Biden's speech clearly implied that a Trump presidency would usher in that tyranny and end our constitutional republic. The Harris campaign will run with that theme until November.\n\nOn that somber note, Joe Biden ended his political career. He spoke in soft, faltering tones that did little to answer Americans' question or reassure them our nation is in capable hands until January 20, 2025.", "source": {"uri": "thespectator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spectator World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charles_lipson@thespectator.com", "name": "Charles Lipson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John F.

We're also securing our border. Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office,\" Biden said.\n\nHe said he was proud to have put together an administration that looks like America, admitting that he had hired for diversity, equity, and inclusion, rather than for ability or skill.\n\nIn the few minutes that Biden struggled to read the teleprompter, he never said exactly why he had sent out the letter withdrawing from the 2024 presidential race, with just over 100 days until the general election.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing can come in the way of saving our democracy, and that includes personal ambition.

The power is in your hands.\"\n\nThe president did not provide further clarity on his decision to step down from the Democratic nomination, nor did he address the campaign by party grandees to oust him after his poor June 27 debate performance.\n\nThe president also did not disclose why he did not make any public appearances before Tuesday, a decision which set off wild speculation about his condition.", "source": {"uri": "theamericanconservative.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The American Conservative"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anastasia_kaliabakos@theamericanconservative.com", "name": "Anastasia Kaliabakos", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screen-Shot-2024-07-24-at-9.18.25-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761289", "eventUri": "eng-9761289", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1601, "textEnd": 1608}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 107, "relevance": 1}

President Biden Just Elected Kamala Harris As The 47th President Of The United States", "body": "I still have tears in the corners of my eyes. Among Presidents, only President Joe Biden could have delivered a speech like this with exactly the impact he desired.\n\nI want to start with this. I think many of you may have forgotten, but all the way back in 2020, when it appeared that Biden had the nomination sewed up, he made a statement I've never forgotten. He basically said, Make no mistake. If I'm elected President, I am caretaker to hand over the torch to the next generation of progressive leaders. Biden was clear eyed about his role all the way back then, he simply ended up handing over the torch four years before he anticipated back then.\n\nPresident Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is in every possible definition of the word a mensch. He is a man of honor, selfless service, and dignity. It took a fat, racist poltroon 92 minutes to ramble, slobber, insult and whine his way through his acceptance speech. It took President Biden 12 minutes to gracefully turn over the torch to the next generation in a graceful, dignified manner.\n\nOnly Biden could have delivered this speech. In his 12 minutes there wasn't a hint of self pity, bitterness, self grievance, or rancor. Instead Biden eloquently spoke of his pride in his 50 years of public service, and expressed sincere gratitude to the American people for giving him the opportunity to serve them for so long.\n\nBiden took the time to recap his successes as President, but it wasn't a rally speech, nor was it handled with the kind of braggadocio bullsh*t of Traitor Tot. Instead he tied his accomplishments to the benefits, that the American people benefitted from, the results of his labor of love.\n\nAnd then Biden consigned His Lowness and his bullsh*t MAGA movement to the ash heap of history. When Biden directly named his Vice President Kamala Harris as the one to carry the torch forward, he didn't waste the opportunity by turning the speech into a campaign rally for Harris. After 50 long years, Biden is smarter than that.\n\nInstead, in the course of 3-4 minutes, Biden irrevocably set the focal point for the November election. And he never mentioned Trump by name, he didn't mention Harris by name. Instead, he landed a 100 mph sucker punch to the American electorate who will determine the election.\n\nBiden put the weight and responsibility of the future of American democracy exactly where it belongs, the American people. He reminded his audience that the only reason he came out of retirement in 2020 to run for President was because he personally felt that democracy itself was threatened by the autocratic Trump. He reminded the audience that George Washington voluntarily gave up the reins of power, that Lincoln gave his life to unite the American people during the Civil War, and that FDR reminded the American people that \"The only thing to fear is fear itself\". Those past leaders all did the job to the best of their abilities, and they changed the course of history.\n\nBut you know what? It all comes down to us. And Biden reminded his audience of that, The United States is unique, because democracy is a dream, it's an idea. And democracy only survives if the American people continue to believe in the dream, that cherished idea. Biden warned the audience that democracy was on the ballot in November, and could only survive if the American people chose once again to stand up and defend it.\n\nHe exited with his greatest hits. He reminded the audience of his favorite tag line, We're the United States of America for god's sake, there's nothing, nothing that we can't do if we all come together and put our minds to it. May God bless the United states of America, and may God protect our troops.\n\nTeelve minutes that may have changed the course of American history. The last month has been a nightmare for the Democrats, and the last four days have been a whirlwind. I would be surprised if the television ratings for Biden's speech tonight don't top the viewership for some Super Bowls. Biden is the rare sitting President since George Washington and LBJ to voluntarily release his hold on power. Americans are going to want to hear for themselves what the man has to say. And what he had to say was to break it down to the simplest denominator.\n\nIt's all about democracy. Look, forget about the personalities, forget about the politics, forget about the rhetoric. This entire election boils down to whether or not democracy in the United States thrives, or withers and dies. Do you want to continue to have the right to go to the polls every 2-4 years and vote out people who don't represent you, or do you want to turn this country over to an autocrat and a single party?\n\nThe GOP has no asnwer. The MAGA cult has spent the last seven years espousing cruelty, sexism, misogyny, and bigotry. They have treated El Pendejo ex Presidente as a cult leader, and their vaunted Project 2025 has cast them in stone as the party of fascism. What do they run on, and how do they refute the Demorats claims? In November, the American People will make that decision for them.", "source": {"uri": "politizoom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PolitiZoom"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_heap_of_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ash heap of history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

It would demolish 235 years of unbroken tradition of securing an independent judiciary through life tenure.\n\nThat's bad for democracy. Judges are supposed to enforce the Constitution and laws as they were written precisely because they were written by the elected representatives of the people.\n\nIf you change the judges, you can change the laws without winning elections.\n\nFranklin D. Roosevelt's 1937 Court-packing plot was so dangerous that the Senate Judiciary Committee, run by his own party, warned that it \"should be so emphatically rejected that its parallel will never again be presented to the free representatives of the free people of America.\"\n\nBiden himself once said that FDR's plan showed that he'd been \"corrupted by power.\"\n\nIf we judge Joe Biden by his last act, he won't be leaving the Oval Office a moment too soon.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secession in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_the_Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franklin D.

I promise you, I know it's hard.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic posed an even more difficult challenge than Mr. Biden imagined, as variants and vaccine resistance led to over 700,000 deaths on his watch. During the toughest stretch of his 2024 reelection campaign, the virus sent him into isolation, and its symptoms were the reason he made the surprise announcement that he would not seek a second term on social media, rather than in person.\n\nJoseph Robinette Biden Jr. was born in 1942, the first pre-baby boom president since 1993.\n\nWhen the economy collapsed in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and his father lost his job, the Biden family moved to Delaware.\n\n\"My dad had an expression,\" Mr. Biden often said. \"He said, Joey, it's not a question of succeeding, whether you get knocked down, it's how quickly you get up.\"\n\nThe president played football at the University of Delaware and attended law school at Syracuse University.\n\nIn 1972, he ran for the U.S. Senate, as a long-shot tell-it-like-it-is 29-year-old.\n\n\"If you like what you see help me out, if you don't, vote for the other fella,\" he told voters on the campaign trail.\n\n\"I think one of the reasons I won is that they have more confidence in me that I will say what I think,\" Mr. Biden said at the time.\n\nWeeks later, his wife Neilia and year-old daughter Naomi were killed in a traffic accident that also injured his sons, Beau and Hunter.\n\n\"I felt like a piece of me died,\" Mr. Biden said. He took the oath of office in a hospital.\n\nAs a single father and U.S. senator, Mr. Biden commuted from Wilmington to Washington every day to be home with his children at night.\n\nIn 1975, he met Jill Jacobs, a teacher, on a blind date, and two years later, they married.\n\n\"Everyone knows I love her more than she loves me,\" he often says.\n\nMr. Biden first ran for president in 1987, but he dropped out after he was accused of plagiarism. A year later, he suffered two brain aneurysms but would later write that he had no fear of dying.\n\nAs chair of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Biden presided over the confirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas. During the hearings, Anita Hill accused Thomas of sexually harassing her years earlier when they worked together. Her testimony was received with hostility from the panel composed entirely of White men, and Mr. Biden weathered criticism at the time and later for the way she was treated. Thomas has consistently said the charges were untrue. Mr. Biden declared an FBI investigation into the accusations inconclusive.\n\nIn 2019, Mr. Biden said, \"To this day I regret I couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved.\" Speaking at the Biden Courage awards, Biden said Hill \"paid a terrible price\" when she testified before a \"bunch of white guys.\"\n\nDuring his Senate career, one of Mr. Biden's greatest points of pride was the 1994 crime bill, which he drafted. It pushed crime down, but incarceration rates increased. The measure also included a ban on assault weapons.\n\nHe ran again for president in 2008, when Barack Obama won the primary and the presidency. But Obama chose him as his running mate, and during two terms, Mr. Biden oversaw stimulus spending and famously got ahead of the president in endorsing gay marriage.\n\n\"What this is all about is a simple proposition: who do you love,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" in May 2012.\n\nMr. Biden also advised President Obama to wait for better confirmation before launching the raid that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nMemorably, he also said of the passage of Obamacare, the national health care law, \"This is a big f****** deal.\"\n\nHe's always been known for verbal gaffes. Some were innocent. \"We choose truth over facts,\" he said at the Iowa State Fair in 2019.\n\nAnd others were less so.\n\n\"They're gonna put y'all back in chains,\" he told voters in Virginia, referring to the Republican-backed budget.\n\nIn 2016, he passed up a presidential run after his son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015.\n\nIn 2020, Mr. Biden's presidential campaign began inauspiciously with distant losses in both Iowa and New Hampshire. But he was able to consolidate support after a decisive victory in South Carolina.\n\n\"To all those who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind, let me say to you: this is your campaign,\" he declared.\n\nFor months, as the pandemic worsened, Mr. Biden stumped virtually -- from his basement. \"This is a war against this virus,\" he said.\n\nMr. Biden made history by picking California Sen. Kamala Harris as his running mate, the first woman of color to be nominated by a major party.\n\n\"Kamala knows how to govern. She knows how to make the hard calls,\" he said in August 2020. \"She's ready to do this job on Day One.\"\n\nThat November, Mr. Biden defeated Donald Trump by 7 million votes. He brushed aside Trump's false claims of fraud and prepared to bring the pandemic under control. In his first 100 days, he accelerated vaccine distribution and strong-armed a $2 trillion COVID relief plan through Congress with slim Democratic majorities.\n\nMr. Biden pitched his candidacy as that of a soft-spoken healer, but he governed more progressively than Obama. He has made his presidency a transition between the nation's older, racially calloused past and its softer, youthful and more inclusive future.\n\nHe appointed the first Black woman to the Supreme Court -- Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is his only Supreme Court nominee so far, and he signed a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill into law\n\nHis presidency was hampered by low approval ratings, an outcome of concerns about high inflation, comparatively lenient border policies and the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.\n\nThroughout his reelection bid, Mr. Biden fought hard and spent tens of millions just to try to stay even with Trump.\n\nBut a disastrous presidential debate against Trump, in which he struggled with hoarseness, keeping his train of thought and finishing sentences, and failed to effectively refute Trump's false claims, raised immediate doubts among Democrats about his ability to finish another four-year term.\n\nHe was unable to stop the erosion of support among lawmakers and top donors, and after defying pressure to drop out for over three weeks, he suddenly announced his exit from the race in a social media post.\n\n\"[W]hile it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term,\" he wrote Sunday afternoon.\n\nEven as president and the presumptive nominee of his party, he saw that the political tides had turned against him. In the end, Mr. Biden was persuaded to preserve his legacy, rather than risk defeat for himself and Democrats nationwide.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"},

His age ultimately caught up with him", "body": "Joe Biden's decision not to contest this year's US election will bring a decades-long political career to an end.\n\nAmerica's oldest-ever president started out as one of its youngest senators, winning his seat just before his 30th birthday -- the minimum age to enter.\n\n\"I expect these fellas are going to eventually judge me on my merit, not on my age,\" he said in a television interview shortly after his victory.\n\nBut more than half a century on, concerns about the 81-year-old's age -- and his capacity to do the job -- became too loud to ignore.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your president,\" Biden wrote in a statement.\n\n\"And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nPerseverance in the face of adversity has been a hallmark of Mr Biden's political and personal life, and initially he'd remained defiant after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump.\n\nBut less than four months out from the November election, the United States' 46th president will step aside for another Democrat to fight for the chance to become its 47th.\n\nWhen Mr Biden won his spot in the US Senate in 1972, he was a married father of three young children.\n\n\"The doors were just beginning to swing open on the rest of our lives,\" he wrote in his 2008 memoir, Promises to Keep.\n\nWithin weeks, he would receive news that would change everything.\n\nMr Biden was in Washington interviewing staff for his new office with his sister Val when she took a phone call that turned her face white.\n\n\"She's dead, isn't she,\" Mr Biden recalled asking his sister about his wife.\n\nNeilia Biden had been driving their children to buy a Christmas tree when their car was hit by a truck.\n\nShe was killed, alongside their baby daughter Naomi, while sons Beau and Hunter were seriously injured.\n\nMr Biden considered ending his federal political career before it had started.\n\nBut he was convinced by fellow Democrats to stay on, and took the oath of office by his son Beau's bedside.\n\nBarbara Perry, a presidential scholar at the University of Virginia, said the tragedy helped to make the future president the \"most empathetic politician imaginable\".\n\n\"Joe Biden, when people would speak to him about a tragedy, and he would commiserate with them, they knew that he had felt this horrible tragedy and pain,\" Ms Perry said.\n\n\"And so, he's become the expert -- the consoler-in-chief.\"\n\nTwo and a half years after losing his wife and daughter, Mr Biden met Jill Jacobs, an aspiring teacher studying English at the University of Delaware.\n\nIn Mr Biden's re-telling, he proposed marriage multiple times before she agreed.\n\nHe even offered her a deal -- marry him and he'd leave the Senate.\n\nBut she stopped him from doing so, saying: \"If I denied you your dream ... I would not be marrying the man I fell in love with.\"\n\nDespite the difficult start, Mr Biden proved to be a solid negotiator and legislator in the Senate, often seeking bipartisan consensus and compromise over the objections of his more progressive colleagues.\n\nHe was well-liked on both sides of the political aisle but some contentious elements of his otherwise moderate 36-year record clung to him on the presidential campaign trail.\n\nAs chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which he sat on for 17 years, Mr Biden oversaw the near-unanimous confirmations of justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court.\n\nBut his handling of the confirmation hearing of Justice Clarence Thomas in 1992 was far from smooth.\n\nThomas was accused of sexually harassing his former colleague, Anita Hill, who reluctantly agreed to testify during the hearing.\n\nHill, an African American law professor, faced a panel of white men and had her claims publicly dissected and sometimes outright dismissed.\n\nAhead of his 2020 presidential bid, Mr Biden expressed \"regret\" over the treatment she received, but never fully reconciled his role in it.\n\n\"I cannot be satisfied by simply saying, 'I'm sorry for what happened to you,'\" Professor Hill told the New York Times.\n\n\"I will be satisfied when I know that there is real change and real accountability and real purpose.\"\n\nMr Biden also faced ongoing criticism for sections of his 1994 crime law -- considered to be one of his key legislative achievements.\n\nHis opponents labelled the law overly punitive, arguing it led to the disproportionate incarceration of black men.\n\nBut even some staunch objectors to the bill's \"tough on crime\" bent have acknowledged the merits of inclusions such as the Violence Against Women Act and a 10-year ban on the sale of some assault weapons.\n\nMr Biden also voted to authorise his predecessor George W Bush's move to invade Iraq in 2002, though he later argued he was misled.\n\nMore than 16 years on, as a frontrunner to win his party's presidential nomination, he claimed to have opposed the war from the \"moment it started\".\n\nThe assertion was roundly rejected by his anti-war colleagues and fact-checkers alike.\n\nMr Biden first ran for president ahead of the 1988 election, but his campaign sank due to a plagiarism scandal.\n\n\"I made some mistakes,\" he told reporters as he withdrew from the race.\n\n\"But now the exaggerated shadow of those mistakes has begun to obscure the essence of my candidacy and the essence of Joe Biden.\"\n\nMonths later, he was in a hotel room in Pennsylvania after giving a speech when he woke up on the floor, fully clothed, with a \"rip of pain\" he'd never felt before.\n\nThe-then-45-year-old was diagnosed with a brain aneurysm.\n\nA priest was called to his hospital bed to give him the last rites.\n\nBut surgeons were able to remove the aneurysm, as well as a second, smaller one, and he returned to the Senate later that year.\n\n\"I had had a lot of time to think about my past and my future, and I wanted to be in the senate for years to come,\" he wrote.\n\n\"For good or ill, I was a public man.\"\n\nTwo decades after his first attempt at running for president, Mr Biden tried again in 2008, ultimately losing to a rising star from a new generation of politicians, Barack Obama.\n\nMr Biden went on to become Mr Obama's vice-president and, after a frosty start, the pair famously formed a close bond.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary man with an extraordinary career in public service,\" Mr Obama said while awarding Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017.\n\n\"Behind the scenes, Joe's candid, honest counsel has made me a better president and a better commander-in-chief.\"\n\nMr Biden decided to rule out another bid for the presidency in 2016 while grieving the loss of his son Beau, an Iraq veteran and former Delaware attorney-general who died of brain cancer.\n\n\"To lose his wife and baby daughter at such a young age in 1972 would have been enough for anyone for one lifetime, but then to lose his son Beau, in 2015, to brain cancer ... He was the apple of his eye,\" Ms Perry said.\n\n\"He was what Joe Biden called 'the perfect Joe Biden' -- if Joe Biden had perfected himself, he said it would be Beau. He called him Joe 2.0.\"\n\nIt was Beau, Mr Biden said, who had urged him to stay involved in public life.\n\n\"He's the one who made me stay engaged, made me promise. 'Promise me Dad, promise me Dad,'\" he told NBC News.\n\nIn 2020, he fulfilled that promise, taking on then-president Donald Trump.\n\nMr Biden pointed to a violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, during Trump's presidency, as a motivating factor in his decision to run.\n\nHe campaigned on a promise to unite the country against a backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and a reckoning with racial violence following the murder of George Floyd.\n\nMr Biden won with 81 million votes, more than any other US president in history -- and more than 51 per cent of the total number cast.\n\nBut Trump falsely claimed the election was stolen, prompting a group of his supporters to storm the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 -- the day Mr Biden's victory was to be certified.\n\n\"We have learned again that democracy is precious,\" Mr Biden told the crowd at his inauguration later that month.\n\n\"Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\"\n\nMr Biden set about trying to move the US past the pandemic, even as COVID-19 continued to claim hundreds of thousands of lives.\n\nInflation soared to its highest level in four decades, intensifying cost of living pressures that many Americans are still struggling with.\n\nAnd a historic surge in the number of migrants entering the US over its border with Mexico made immigration one of the top concerns for many voters.\n\nMr Biden chalked up legislative victories on infrastructure spending and manufacturing, and successfully pushed for the most significant package of gun control laws in decades following the Uvalde school shooting.\n\nHe chose Kamala Harris to be America's first female vice-president and nominated the first black woman to the US Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown-Jackson.\n\nAnd when the court overturned Roe v Wade, ending the constitutional right to an abortion, Mr Biden made reproductive rights a major political focus.\n\nDemocrats defied predictions of a so-called \"red wave\" to maintain control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAnd while they lost the House of Representatives, Republicans took control with a razor-thin margin.\n\nTrump's hand-picked candidates largely failed to deliver in the midterms, prompting questions about his ongoing influence.\n\nBut he announced his 2024 candidacy soon after and went on to dominate the Republican primaries, easily securing enough support to become the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMr Biden had regularly pointed to his foreign policy experience on the campaign trail, both as a former vice-president and the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nBut his approval ratings slumped after the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nThe pace of the fall of Kabul shocked US intelligence officials, as Taliban fighters swept through the capital and the government collapsed within days.\n\nThe domestic political fallout for the Biden administration was swift and severe, with a Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee launching an investigation in the aftermath of the withdrawal.\n\nMr Biden promised to step up US engagement in the Indo-Pacific region in the face of China's increasing aggression, agreeing to the AUKUS deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, and strengthening ties with Pacific Island leaders.\n\nAnd he rallied the West in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, helping to expand the NATO alliance and pledging to support Kyiv for \"as long as it takes\".\n\nHowever as the war dragged on, support for Ukraine in Congress fell, and passing further financial aid became more difficult.\n\nMr Biden also faced intense scrutiny over his support for Israel after Hamas' October 7 attacks sparked a months-long bombardment of Gaza.\n\nThe president approved billions of dollars worth of military support for the country at the same time it deployed assistance for Gaza's worsening humanitarian crisis.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests engulfed US college campuses, and Mr Biden's public appearances were regularly interrupted by demonstrators.\n\nHe faced protest votes in some of his 2024 primary elections, with tens of thousands of people in the swing state of Michigan voting \"uncommitted\" rather than for the president.\n\nWithout any serious challengers though, Mr Biden's path to the Democratic presidential nomination seemed to be in no doubt.\n\nRepublican control of the House of Representatives increased political pressure on the president, with the launch of an impeachment inquiry and probes into his son Hunter's foreign business dealings.\n\nHunter Biden was also the subject of federal investigations which resulted in the now-54-year-old being charged with tax and firearms offences.\n\nHis criminal trial on the gun charges earlier this year exposed damaging details about his drug addiction, and led to the first-ever conviction of a child of a sitting president.\n\nHis father sought to sharpen his attack over another historic court case, after Trump was found guilty of falsifying business records in New York.\n\nMr Biden started referring to Trump as a \"convicted felon\" and repeatedly criticised his handling of the January 6 attack, arguing he was not fit for the White House.\n\nBut the president's own capacity to do the job came under increasing scrutiny, with concerns about his age -- which had been aired since his 2020 campaign -- taking on new urgency.\n\nMr Biden has been open about a stutter he experienced as a child, recalling in his memoir that he spoke \"like Morse code. Dot-dot-dot-dot-dash-dash-dash-dash\".\n\nWhile he improved the stutter by reciting long poems in the mirror, he said earlier this year that he had \"struggled\" with it his whole life.\n\nThe president has a long history of verbal slip-ups, and once described himself as a \"gaffe machine\".\n\nBut not all of his stumbles could be easily explained.\n\nAt a public event in 2022, he asked \"Where's Jackie\", appearing to forget that Republican representative Jackie Walorski had died the previous month.\n\nThe White House argued he made the comment because she was \"top of mind\".\n\nQuestions around Mr Biden's mental acuity also intensified after a federal prosecutor investigating his handling of classified documents wrote that he would likely present to a jury as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\".\n\nThe president called a snap press conference to hit back at the report, only to confuse the presidents of Egypt and Mexico.\n\nMr Biden's physical fitness was also queried.\n\nFootage of the president falling on the stairs to Air Force One, and on stage at a graduation ceremony, were watched around the world.\n\nAnd he reportedly changed his routine around arriving at and leaving the White House to draw less attention to his \"halting and stiff gait\".\n\nHowever, the turning point came when Mr Biden faced off against Trump in their first debate of the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe president's team had called for the unusually early showdown and spent days helping him to prepare at the Maryland retreat Camp David.\n\nConcerns in the Democratic Party were raised from the moment he walked out.\n\nMr Biden spoke with a hoarse voice, appeared to stare blankly at times while Trump was speaking, and trailed off to the point where some of his answers did not make sense.\n\nThe White House blamed a cold, and then jet lag, with the president telling donors in the aftermath that he \"nearly fell asleep on stage\".\n\nHe later conceded he had a bad night, but insisted he was still the best person for the job and would not withdraw from the race.\n\nThe president hit out at what he called \"elites\" within the party calling for him to step aside, arguing Democratic voters had endorsed him overwhelmingly to be the candidate in the party's primary elections.\n\nUltimately, though, the pressure on Mr Biden only increased.\n\nAs dozens of Democrats publicly called on him to step aside, the president was diagnosed with COVID-19 on July 18.\n\nIsolated at his Delaware home, he decided to call time on his political career, although he insisted he would finish his presidential term.\n\nHe threw his endorsement behind his 59-year-old deputy Kamala Harris.\n\nMr Biden once suggested he'd serve as a \"bridge\" to a new generation of leaders, and his decision to seek another four years in office raised questions from the beginning.\n\nAfter so many years spent in public life, his legacy extends beyond his one term in the White House.\n\nBut the timing of his exit, and the way in which he did so, could have a profound impact on the outcome of this election and who Americans choose to take over in 2025.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type":

But They're Glad He Quit.", "body": "WILMINGTON, Del. -- As President Joe Biden met with confidants last week to discuss whether he should end his reelection campaign, John Flaherty, a retired government employee, was seated in a booth at Angelo's Luncheonette in Wilmington, Delaware, the small city that has been Biden's political home base for more than 50 years.\n\nWearing a Philadelphia Phillies cap, Flaherty, 73, who worked as a staff assistant to Biden in the 1980s, invoked the song \"The Gambler\" to express his opinion of what the president should do.\n\n\"As Kenny Rogers said, 'You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,'\" he said.\n\nSign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times\n\nShortly after Biden announced that he had put an end to his bid, Flaherty weighed in by phone. \"I'm glad,\" he said. \"I think he should enjoy his life after January and spend time with his family.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"happy\" that Biden's withdrawal had left Donald Trump as the oldest major-party presidential nominee. \"Biden might be the oldest president,\" he said, but now \"Trump will be the oldest candidate\" for president.\n\nWilmington, a city of roughly 71,000, is the site of the Joseph R. Biden Railroad Station, one of the busiest Amtrak stops along the Northeast Corridor, and Biden's main residence is in a nearby suburb. But even here, in the world's most Biden-friendly enclave, Flaherty was just one of many who believed the president had made the right call.\n\nMost people I spoke with for this article seemed fond of the president but pessimistic about his reelection prospects. And everybody, it seemed, had a Biden story.\n\nAt Angelo's, where Biden used to stop in for meals, I heard about a poster from his 1988 presidential campaign that had pride of place on a wall near the booths. For years, a smiling Biden, surrounded by his wife and children, looked down on the customers.\n\nEarly in Trump's presidency, the poster prompted occasional anti-Biden remarks, according to Nina, a server at the restaurant who did not want to share her last name. And then, at some point, the bickering among the customers over politics grew more heated. Finally, the staff had enough and took the poster down.\n\n\"People are jerks,\" Nina said softly, as if not wanting to provoke more arguing.\n\nEven in Wilmington, which propelled a 29-year-old Biden to the U.S. Senate in 1972, local pride has met political reality.\n\nBiden moved with his family from Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Wilmington in 1953, at age 10. For 70 years, he has been rooted in this place, and he has shaken thousands of hands in its neighborhoods, from Little Italy to Trolley Square.\n\nOne of his most ardent local supporters is Eunice LaFate, an artist who operates LaFate Gallery on Market Street, where she sells her paintings.\n\nBorn and raised in Jamaica, LaFate, 77, moved to Wilmington in 1983 after meeting her husband, a city native who worked for Amtrak. \"I saw a banner in a park on a yellow board,\" she said, sitting amid her colorful paintings last week. \"It said, 'Wilmington -- A Place to Be Somebody.'\"\n\nLaFate spent 12 years working for a bank in town, she said. The shift to becoming a full-time artist and gallerist was inspired, in part, by an encouraging letter she received from then-Sen. Biden after one of her paintings had adorned the cover of Out & About, a local entertainment publication.\n\nLaFate's Biden story has to do with his son Beau, who died in May 2015, shortly after the death of her husband.\n\n\"When his son passed, I stood five hours in a line at the church, waiting to greet him,\" LaFate said. \"After the five hours waiting in line, I went up and expressed my condolences. And I mentioned to him I am going through grief myself. The man took time out to console me. It was just -- what should I say -- so moving. The crowd was waiting, but he took time out.\"\n\nThere was no portrait of Biden on the walls of LaFate's gallery, but she went into the back to show me another one she had done -- of Kamala Harris, painted after the 2020 election, wearing a white shirt and a black blazer against a pink background.\n\nIn an interview the day after Biden's announcement, LaFate seemed happy with the turn of events. \"This is where our salad bowl of culture comes into play,\" she said. \"And Kamala Harris is a very dynamic ingredient in that salad. And she has Jamaican heritage! Her father is Jamaican. So all of this combined, this is pretty dynamic for me.\"\n\nJerry duPhily, the publisher of Out & About, spoke fondly of the president over lunch last week at the Kozy Korner, another Wilmington spot that Biden has been known to frequent.\n\n\"People go, 'Why does he come back so much?'\" duPhily, 66, said. \"I think he likes it here. He's comfortable.\" But he added that there were concerns. \"I think a lot of people are cognizant of, 'You're 81, and you lost a step, and we see it,'\" he said.\n\nAfter the announcement, duPhily said that Biden had made the right decision, in his view. \"Maybe he could have made it a few weeks earlier,\" he said. \"But someone who has the history he does, which is being a fighter and determined, isn't just going to walk away from it.\"\n\nDuPhily added that he hoped Biden would build his presidential library in Wilmington, saying, \"OK, he's from Scranton -- but he's Delaware Joe.\"\n\nPerhaps more than anyone else, Mike Purzycki, Wilmington's 57th mayor, a Democrat who ran unopposed by any Republican to win his second term in 2020, knows what Biden has been going through. A few months ago, he announced that he would not be seeking a third term. (Local term-limit laws allow the city's mayor to serve 12 years.)\n\n\"I'm 79,\" Purzycki said over lunch at Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House and Saloon, a onetime biker bar turned elevated saloon at the corner of 14th and Scott streets. \"I took a look and said, 'Can I do this four more years?'\"\n\nA native of New Jersey, Purzycki came to the state on a football scholarship to the University of Delaware, where he lived in the same dormitory as Biden. He worked for IBM, became a real estate developer and served as the executive director of the Riverfront Development Corp., which turned Wilmington's blighted riverfront into an area of parks, walking trails, restaurants, stores, nightclubs and new housing.\n\nOnce considered a corporate town where the sidewalks roll up at 5 o'clock, Wilmington now has buzzy restaurants downtown. Transplants from out of state are discovering the beautiful architecture, ample parks and relative affordability, all within an easy drive to bigger cities and beaches. This is the Wilmington to which Biden will return.\n\nHe will have to figure out how to spend the days after he leaves office. Purzycki has no easy advice about that.\n\n\"I'm struggling,\" he said of his own post-retirement plans. \"I'm struggling mightily.\"\n\nIn a statement Monday, the mayor showed his support for Biden's decision to withdraw, writing that the president \"has shown himself to be someone who courageously put the welfare of his fellow citizens above personal ambition.\"\n\nThe headquarters of the now defunct Biden-Harris campaign occupied a nondescript high-rise office building downtown. Last week, there were no big signs out front, no staff members scurrying in and out, nothing to suggest an operation running at full steam. That may change soon.\n\n\"It's the first full day of our campaign,\" Harris posted on social media Monday morning, \"so I'm heading up to Wilmington, DE later to say 'hello' to our staff in HQ. One day down. 105 to go. Together, we're going to win this.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

But They're Glad He Quit", "body": "As President Biden met with confidants last week to discuss whether he should end his re-election campaign, John Flaherty, a retired government employee, was seated in a booth at Angelo's Luncheonette in Wilmington, Del., the small city that has been Mr. Biden's political home base for more than 50 years.\n\nWearing a Philadelphia Phillies cap, Mr. Flaherty, 73, who worked as a staff assistant to Mr. Biden in the 1980s, invoked the song \"The Gambler\" to express his opinion of what the president should do.\n\n\"As Kenny Rogers said, 'You got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em,'\" he said.\n\nShortly after Mr. Biden announced that he had put an end to his bid, Mr. Flaherty weighed in by phone. \"I'm glad,\" he said. \"I think he should enjoy his life after January and spend time with his family.\"\n\nHe added that he was \"happy\" that Biden's withdrawal had left Donald Trump as the oldest major-party presidential nominee. \"Biden might be the oldest president,\" he said, but now, \"Trump will be the oldest candidate\" for president.\n\nWilmington, a city of roughly 71,000, is the site of the Joseph R. Biden Railroad Station, one of the busiest Amtrak stops along the Northeast Corridor, and Mr. Biden's main residence is in a nearby suburb. But even here, in the world's most Biden-friendly enclave, Mr. Flaherty was just one of many who believed the president had made the right call.\n\nMost people I spoke with for this article seemed fond of the president, but pessimistic about his re-election prospects. And everybody, it seemed, had a Joe Biden story.\n\nAt Angelo's, where Mr. Biden used to stop in for meals, I heard about a poster from his 1988 presidential campaign that had pride of place on a wall near the booths. For years, a smiling Mr. Biden, surrounded by his wife and children, looked down on the customers.\n\nEarly in the presidency of Donald J. Trump, the poster prompted occasional anti-Biden remarks, according to Nina, a server at the restaurant who did not want to share her last name. And then, at some point, the bickering among the customers over politics grew more heated. Finally, the staff had enough and took the poster down.\n\n\"People are jerks,\" Nina said, softly, as if not wanting to provoke more arguing.\n\nEven in Wilmington, which propelled a 29-year-old Mr. Biden to the United States Senate in 1972, local pride has met political reality.\n\nHe moved with his family from Scranton, Pa., to Wilmington in 1953, at age 10. For 70 years, he has been rooted in this place, and he has shaken thousands of hands in its neighborhoods, from Little Italy to Trolley Square.\n\nOne of his most ardent local supporters is Eunice LaFate, an artist who operates LaFate Gallery on Market Street, where she sells her paintings.\n\nBorn and raised in Jamaica, Ms. LaFate, 77, moved to Wilmington in 1983 after meeting her husband, a city native who worked for Amtrak. \"I saw a banner in a park on a yellow board,\" she said, sitting amid her colorful paintings last week. \"It said, 'Wilmington -- A Place to Be Somebody.'\"\n\nMs. LaFate spent 12 years working for a bank in town, she said. The shift to becoming a full-time artist and gallerist was inspired, in part, by an encouraging letter she received from then-Senator Biden after one of her paintings had adorned the cover of Out & About, a local entertainment publication.\n\nMs. LaFate's Joe Biden story has to do with his son Beau, who died in May 2015, shortly after the death of her husband.\n\n\"When his son passed, I stood five hours in a line at the church, waiting to greet him,\" Ms. LaFate said. \"After the five hours waiting in line, I went up and expressed my condolences. And I mentioned to him I am going through grief myself. The man took time out to console me. It was just, what should I say, so moving. The crowd was waiting, but he took time out.\"\n\nThere was no portrait of Mr. Biden on the walls of Ms. LaFate's gallery, but she went into the back to show me another one she had done -- of Kamala Harris, painted after the 2020 election, wearing a white shirt and a black blazer against a pink background.\n\nIn an interview the day after Mr. Biden's announcement, Ms. LaFate seemed happy with the turn of events. \"This is where our salad bowl of culture comes into play,\" she said. \"And Kamala Harris is a very dynamic ingredient in that salad. And she has Jamaican heritage! Her father is Jamaican. So, all of this combined, this is pretty dynamic for me.\"\n\nJerry duPhily, the publisher of Out & About, spoke fondly of the president over lunch last week at the Kozy Korner, another Wilmington spot that Mr. Biden has been known to frequent.\n\n\"People go, 'Why does he come back so much?'\" Mr. duPhily, 66, said. \"I think he likes it here. He's comfortable.\" But he added that there were concerns. \"I think a lot of people are cognizant of, 'You're 81, and you lost a step, and we see it,'\" he said.\n\nAfter the announcement, Mr. duPhily said that Mr. Biden had made the right decision, in his view. \"Maybe he could have made it a few weeks earlier,\" he said. \"But someone who has the history he does, which is being a fighter and determined, isn't just going to walk away from it.\"\n\nMr. duPhily added that he hoped Mr. Biden would build his presidential library in Wilmington, saying, \"OK, he's from Scranton -- but he's Delaware Joe.\"\n\nPerhaps more than anyone else, Mike Purzycki, Wilmington's 57th mayor, a Democrat who ran unopposed by any Republican to win his second term in 2020, knows what Mr. Biden has been going through. A few months ago, he announced that he would not be seeking a third term. (Local term-limit laws allow the city's mayor to serve 12 years.)\n\n\"I'm 79,\" Mr. Purzycki said over lunch at Kid Shelleen's Charcoal House and Saloon, a onetime biker bar turned elevated saloon at the corner of 14th and Scott streets. \"I took a look and said, 'Can I do this four more years?'\"\n\nA native of New Jersey, Mr. Purzycki came to the state on a football scholarship to the University of Delaware, where he lived in the same dormitory as Mr. Biden. He worked for IBM, became a real estate developer and served as the executive director of the Riverfront Development Corporation, which turned Wilmington's blighted riverfront into an area of parks, walking trails, restaurants, stores, nightclubs and new housing.\n\nOnce considered a corporate town where the sidewalks roll up at five o'clock, Wilmington now has buzzy restaurants downtown. Transplants from out of state are discovering the beautiful architecture, ample parks and relative affordability, all within an easy drive to bigger cities and beaches. This is the Wilmington to which Mr. Biden will return.\n\nHe will have to figure out how to spend the days after he leaves office. Mr. Purzycki has no easy advice about that.\n\n\"I'm struggling,\" he said of his own post-retirement plans. \"I'm struggling mightily.\"\n\nIn a statement on Monday, the mayor showed his support for Mr. Biden's decision to withdraw, writing that the president \"has shown himself to be someone who courageously put the welfare of his fellow citizens above personal ambition.\"\n\nThe headquarters of the now defunct Biden-Harris campaign occupied a nondescript high-rise office building downtown. Last week, there were no big signs out front, no staff members scurrying in and out, nothing to suggest an operation running at full steam. That may change soon.\n\n\"It's the first full day of our campaign,\" Ms. Harris posted on social media on Monday morning, \"so I'm heading up to Wilmington, DE later to say 'hello' to our staff in HQ. One day down. 105 to go. Together, we're going to win this.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

Rod Blagojevich denounced former President Barack Obama as a \"threat to democracy\" and blamed him for President Biden dropping out of the presidential race.\n\nIn an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Blagojevich said Mr. Biden was the victim of the \"old-school way of Chicago backroom politics.\"\n\n\"Mr. Obama was the conductor of the band that successfully orchestrated the removal of the presidential candidate chosen by more than 14 million Democratic primary voters -- to be replaced by someone he and the party bosses choose instead. It's classic ward-boss tactics,\" he said.\n\n\"It isn't Donald Trump who is an existential threat to our democracy,\" he said. \"It's Barack Obama.\"\n\nMr. Blagojevich, a Democrat who served as governor from 2003 to 2009, said he's known Mr. Obama for nearly 30 years, and they both grew up in Chicago politics.\n\n\"We understand how it works -- with the bosses over the people. Mr. Obama learned the lessons well,\" he said. \"And what he just did to Mr. Biden is what political bosses have been doing in Chicago since the 1871 fire -- selections masquerading as elections.\"\n\nIn the column, the former Illinois governor related the dynamic between Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden to what he experienced in 2009 when the state legislature impeached him and removed him from office, which he said was orchestrated from \"conversations initiated by Mr. Obama himself.\"\n\n\"A common element in my case and now Mr. Biden's is Mr. Obama's involvement,\" he said. \"He's the central figure who played a behind-the-scenes role in both stories.\"\n\nMr. Blagojevich was impeached and removed on corruption charges related to his solicitation of bribes to try to \"sell\" the U.S. Senate seat Mr. Obama left open when he was elected president.\n\nHe was sentenced to 14 years in prison on related federal bribery charges in 2011. Former President Trump commuted Mr. Blagojevich's prison sentence in 2020.\n\nIn his Monday op-ed, Mr. Blagojevich said rich donors such as Mr. Obama, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Hollywood and Silicon Valley elites, \"are the new bosses of today's Democratic Party.\"\n\n\"All along, Mr. Biden and the Democratic politicians have been claiming that this year's presidential race is about 'saving democracy.' They are the biggest hypocrites in American political history,\" he wrote. \"The party that says it is running to save democracy has already deployed the criminal-justice system against the leading candidate of the opposition party. And now they have successfully maneuvered to dump their duly elected candidate for president.\"\n\nHe also accused Democrats of covering up Mr. Biden's unfitness for \"a long time.\"\n\nHe said the Democratic National Convention next month \"will provide the perfect backdrop and place for Mr. Obama to finish the job and choose his candidate, not the voters' candidate.\"\n\n\"Democracy, no. Chicago ward-boss politics, yes,\" he said.\n\nMr. Biden stepped down from the presidential race Sunday and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to take over his spot on the Democratic ticket.\n\nA

And that time and place is now.\"\n\nBiden talked up his record in the White House and made clear that he still believes he deserves a second term.\n\nAside from referring to a need to \"unite\" his party, he didn't provide any detail on what had eventually changed his mind after weeks of defiance.\n\nBut in echoing language used against his candidacy in the days leading up to his announcement, declaring it was now time to \"pass the torch\", Biden pointed to his previous but later abandoned pledge of being a \"bridge\" candidate to a new generation.\n\nAnd in an election in which he argues democracy itself is on the line, the president sought to frame his decision as being bigger than \"personal ambition\".\n\nBiden will join a relatively small group of US presidents who opted out of running for a second term.\n\nHistory will judge how the manner and timing of his exit affects his party's chances in November.\n\nFor all the excitement now building within Democratic circles about Vice-President Kamala Harris, some would argue Biden should have bowed out sooner.\n\nBut with six months still to go until his successor takes over, the president is now focused on trying to cement his legacy with the time he has left in the White House.\n\nRepublicans have called on Biden to quit altogether, arguing that if the president isn't up to serving for another four years, he shouldn't be the commander-in-chief now.\n\nBut Biden again insisted in his address that he'd serve out the remainder of his term, and singled out several priorities for the months ahead.\n\nThe president has foreshadowed controversial changes to the Supreme Court, reportedly involving term limits and an enforceable ethics code, at a time when conservative justices are in the majority.\n\nHe promised a continued focus on strengthening the NATO alliance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and vowed \"to keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific\".\n\nAnd he said he'd \"keep working\" to end the war in Gaza, nine months into a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives.\n\nBiden followed up by meeting Israel's prime minister, a day after Benjamin Netanyahu told Congress he would settle for nothing less than \"total victory\" against Hamas.\n\nThe US remains Israel's most important ally and has sent the country billions of dollars of military assistance, even as Biden has at times criticised Netanyahu's approach to the war.\n\nSpeaking as the two leaders met, White House spokesman John Kirby said the president would be pressing Netanyahu for progress towards an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages.\n\n\"We are closer now, we believe, than we've been before,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"We believe that they are of a nature where they can be closed, and that we can achieve a deal, but it's going to require as it always does, some leadership, some compromise and an effort to get there.\"\n\nNetanyahu also sat down with Harris, who'd skipped his congressional address, citing a scheduling clash.\n\nIn remarks delivered after the meeting, which she described as \"frank and constructive\", she said Israel had a right to defend itself, but \"how it does so matters\", adding that she had \"serious concern about the scale of human suffering\".\n\n\"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,\" she said.\n\nAsked whether Harris would approach the conflict differently to Biden, Kirby earlier insisted the vice-president had been a \"full partner\" in the administration's Middle East policies.\n\nBut she appears to have at least signalled a shift in how she'll discuss the conflict, and seemed to try to appeal to voters who've abandoned the president over his handling of the war.\n\n\"To everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you,\" she said.\n\n\"Let's get the deal done.\"\n\nNetanyahu is also looking ahead to the possibility of a second Trump administration, with plans to meet the former president at his Mar-a-lago property in Florida on his way home.\n\n\"I want him to finish up and get it done quickly,\" Trump told Fox News of his message to Netanyahu ahead of his visit.\n\n\"You know Israel is not very good at public relations, I'll tell you that.\"\n\nThings have moved quickly on the Democratic side of politics in the days since Biden's withdrawal reshaped the race.\n\nThe vice-president speedily secured the support needed to solidify her position as the expected nominee, and has started sharpening her attack against Trump.\n\nOne of Harris's central campaign messages is that of the \"prosecutor vs the felon\", contrasting her public record against the former president's criminal convictions.\n\nShe's also leaning into her relative youth, and a wave of timely gen Z memes, and will likely ramp up her focus on reproductive rights -- an issue she'd already taken the lead on as part of the Biden-Harris ticket.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has well and truly shifted his focus onto his new opponent.\n\nAt a rally in North Carolina, held just before Biden's national address, the former president repeatedly pronounced her name incorrectly (for the record, it's KAHM-uh-luh), and branded Harris a \"radical left lunatic\".\n\nAnd in that same Fox interview on Thursday, he hit back at the vice-president's criticisms as \"disgusting\".\n\n\"They say, 'Sir, be nice, you just got hit with a bullet, maybe he's changed, be nice,'\" he said.\n\n\"And I'd love to be nice but I'm dealing against real garbage.\"\n\nTrump's campaign is making several key arguments against Harris -- that her background in the liberal city of San Francisco shows she's too far to the left, that she botched an immigration role assigned to her in the early days of the Biden administration, and that she helped to cover up concerns about Biden's age.\n\nIt will take some time before opinion polls paint a picture of where voters might be sitting following the Biden/Harris switch, but early surveys suggest Americans are still in for a close race.\n\nAnd in the meantime, it appears calls to dial down the political rhetoric since Trump's attempted assassination have all but evaporated.\n\nElevating Harris to the top spot means the vice-president now needs to choose her own running mate.\n\nSome analysts are sceptical of the idea that a vice-presidential pick can influence the outcome in particular states, instead arguing they help to shape perceptions of the candidate running for the White House.\n\nEither way, a long list of names has been floated and Harris's campaign will be weighing up how they'd fare against Trump's newly announced number two, JD Vance.\n\nAt 39 years old, the Ohio senator is much younger than Trump and has emphasised his \"Rust Belt\" upbringing in a way their campaign hopes will connect with working class voters.\n\nBut Vance is firmly in Trump's so-called MAGA camp of the Republican Party, and others have reportedly expressed \"buyer's remorse\" in the wake of Harris's ascension, given the need to appeal to independent and swing voters in critical states.\n\nVance's cause might not have been helped by the resurfacing of a 2021 interview in which he argued the US was being run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made\".\n\nHe went on to name several Democrats, including Harris, asking: \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\"\n\nFormer secretary of state and Democrats presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared the clip on X, sarcastically describing Vance as \"a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms\".\n\nWhile the actor Jennifer Aniston -- who has spoken openly about her difficulties with IVF -- posted a message on Instagram saying: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Vance hit back at the criticism, highlighting the senator's openness about his success being due \"in large part to the influence of strong female role models like his grandmother\".\n\nBut winning over American women who've mobilised in the two years since Trump's Supreme Court picks helped to end the nation-wide right to abortion has always presented a challenge for the former president.\n\nWith the election again re-set after an already tumultuous few weeks, both sides are scrambling to gain ground just a few months out from polling day.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A young woman, Sammi Berard, had lost her engagement ring and was hoping someone would find it.\n\nThe ring was lost on the weekend, on busy Jagger Mill Road in Sanford. Berard and her fianc\u00e9 Matt Hodsdon looked for four hours, using a metal detector, but came up empty-handed. Others looked too.\n\nWorthing didn't know Berard, but the posting struck her.\n\n\"It broke my heart,\" said Worthing, imagining how Berard must have felt.\n\nSo on Monday, when Worthing was driving home from work, she stopped on Jagger Mill Road and had a look. She searched the area where Berard said she lost the ring, but she too, came up empty-handed.\n\nWorthing isn't Catholic, but she said a prayer to St. Anthony, known as the saint of lost things.\n\nAt 7:24 a.m., she did, right on the fog line, in the same area she'd searched the day before.\n\nWhen the two met on Wednesday afternoon, there were tears as Worthing reached into her pocket and turned the square-cut ring over to Berard.\n\nHodsdon, her fianc\u00e9, first proposed to Berard in late December. In the spring, when there was still some snow on the ground, the couple took a trip to North Conway, New Hampshire, and stopped off at a jewelry store.\n\n\"He told me to pick one out 'because I want to marry you,'\" Berard said her fianc\u00e9 told her.\n\nThey've set a wedding date for June 23, next year.\n\nBerard was in the passenger seat as the couple was driving down Jagger Mill Road on Saturday. She'd recently had a bout of flu and lost some weight. Berard said the window was open, and she was talking with her hands when the ring swooped off her finger, bounced on the interior of the car and flew out the window. They searched and searched, to no avail.\n\nWhen she found the ring on Tuesday, Worthing sent Berard a message and at first heard nothing -- Berard works second shift and was sleeping with her phone turned off. So Worthing posted about her find on the Facebook thread and the congratulatory messages started pouring in. One posting came from Berard's sister, and when she awoke, she had a message to call her. Then her fianc\u00e9 told her to look on Facebook, where Worthing posted that she had found the engagement ring.\n\nWorthing said her prayer to St. Anthony did the trick -- as it did for her a week ago when she couldn't find her debit card, despite thoroughly examining her wallet. She said the prayer, waited a bit, and then looked in the wallet again, and the card was there, where it was supposed to be, she said.\n\n\"My grandson says \"nothing is really lost til Gigi can't find it,'\" said Worthing.\n\nAs to the engagement ring?\n\n\"I haven't stopped smiling,\" said Berard as she gazed at her ring. \"I'm so happy. We looked for hours. I felt no one would find it.\"\n\n\"I'll never forget you,' she told Worthing as she thanked her.", "id": "9767074", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Stranger finds lost engagement ring along Maine road after seeing Facebook plea", "image": "https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/08/42501581_H21072514-600x400.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1510, "date": "2017-06-23", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1517}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Worthing"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "82011", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worthing", "label": {"eng": "Worthing"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "North Conway"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "216114", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Conway,_New_Hampshire", "label": {"eng": "North Conway"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}, "id": "304767", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery"}, {"label": {"eng": "Georgia May Jagger"}, "id": "326487", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 551, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 761, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 954, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Wedding"}], "time": "19:54:00"}

He looked it up. He discovered it meant \"having characteristics of both sexes or no characteristics of either sex\".\n\nAnd he decided it was perfect for his gender-blending extravaganza.\n\nHe brings it to St Paul's, Chapel Road, Worthing (01903 368967) on August 25 (doors 7.30pm, start 8pm, tickets \u00a313).\n\nThe piece offers a celebration of iconic women in music as Paul and his seven-piece ensemble bring the show to the place where it all started, Paul's hometown.\n\nPaul is promising a colourful, camp cabaret extravaganza as they re-imagine classic songs originally performed by female artists including Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell and PJ Harvey, to name but a few.\n\nPaul is inviting you to dance, sing, laugh and cry as he interweaves his stories of childhood out-castings and social misfittery into a string of well-loved compositions, promising every sense will be tantalised in an outrageous, rainbow-coloured romp.\n\n\"I was born and brought up in Worthing, but I have been away for 15 years. I have lived all over the place.\n\n\"I lived in Sydney for a while, and I have just come back from Berlin, but mainly I have been living in Brighton.\n\n\"I was at Worthing High from 94-98, and I suppose I struggled like most teenagers, not really anything to do with Worthing. But there were things growing up... and that's really what this show is about.\n\n\"The idea came to me in Berlin. I wanted to create something new, and Berlin is the home of cabaret. I wanted to do some covers.\n\n\"For years, I have been writing my own stuff, but I wanted to focus on some of the songs that had meant something to me. I started with Sade, and then I thought about doing a covers show of my favourite artists, and it just so happens that a lot of them are female artists.\n\n\"And then I thought that I want to tell my own story. The songs are all in different styles. There is Kate Bush, Bjork, Diana Ross, Suzanne Vega, Tracy Chapman, people like that, a lot of 80s music, and they all mean different things to me.\n\n\"They are like the soundtrack of my life, the stuff that I was listening to when I was growing up and feeling really outside and alone. I felt really confused about my gender, thinking that it would be a life-long problem.\n\n\"There is a lot of talk about that in the show - though I don't want to give away any of the answers now, but this was the music I was growing up listening to in the 80s and 90s in Worthing, and music was my salvation.\n\n\"There is now a lot of talk about trans and things like that, and I think it is brilliant. But in the 80s and 90s there wasn't, and Worthing was a small town...\"\n\nIt all comes together in Epicene, a musical event presented in a cabaret style that will appeal to a wide audience, bringing together regular gig-goers, fans of the theatre and cabaret queens as well as the LGBT community and its allies, Paul hopes.\n\n\"I wanted to create a fun platform for me to share my story of gender confusion through music that was personal to me but that would reach others and spread the message of the It Gets Better project, an organisation whose mission is to communicate to LGBT youth around the world that life does get better.\"\n\nDon't miss out on all the latest breaking news where you live.\n\nHere are four ways you can be sure you'll be amongst the first to know what's going on.\n\n4) Register with us by clicking on 'sign in' (top right corner).

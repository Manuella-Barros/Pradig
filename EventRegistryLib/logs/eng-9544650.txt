He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag.

Those hopes ended late Tuesday when Rikuya Hoshino (No. 94) withdrew.\n\nThe PGA leans on a catch-all category of \"special invitations.\" The group of LIV players includes Patrick Reed, whose tie for 12th in the Masters moved him inside the top 100. He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nJoaquin Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, already received an invitation. The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had been invited.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert and Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Alex Smalley.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

Although players from LIV Golf do not accrue Official World Golf Ranking points, there are some who earned an invite by being inside the top 100, including Patrick Reed, whose top-12 finish at the Masters last month put inside the top 100 of the OWGR at No. 92 to keep his streak of playing every major alive since the 2014 Masters Tournament.\n\nThe highest-ranked player from LIV Golf playing the PGA Championshp is Jon Rahm, who sits at No. 5. Rahm is looking for his best finish at this event since his T8 in 2021 and his T4 in 2018. Last year, Rahm finished T50 one month after his Masters win and in 2022 he tied for 48th.\n\nThere are other players who received an exemption, specifically through the approval of the PGA of America tournament committee to allow an invite, like Joaquin Niemann and Talor Gooch.\n\nRelated: PGA Championship FAQ: What, When and More, including the qualification process into the second major of 2024\n\nThere are 16 players from the LIV Golf circuit that will be competing at the PGA Championship at Valhalla, led by Koepka, the three-time PGA Championship winner. The 16 players from LIV Golf is two players short of last year's 18.\n\nOne of those players who competed in last year's PGA Championship but not this year's is Louis Oosthuizen, who was the 2010 Open Champion and has finished as a runner-up in all four majors, including the 2012 Masters, the 2015 and 2021 U.S. Open, 2015 Open Championship and the 2017 and 2021 PGA Championship.

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago. Among those left off the list was former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen, who won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour. He is No. 125 in the world.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals - 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Doug

Those hopes ended late Tuesday when Rikuya Hoshino (No. 94) withdrew.\n\nAlso Read | Athletic Bilbao Striker Gorka Guruzeta Undergoes Appendix Operation, Will Miss Rest of La Liga 2023-24 Season.\n\nThe PGA leans on a catch-all category of \"special invitations.\" The group of LIV players includes Patrick Reed, whose tie for 12th in the Masters moved him inside the top 100. He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nAlso Read | Pat Cummins Birthday Special: Quick Facts to Know About ICC Cricket World Cup and WTC Winning Captain.\n\nJoaquin Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, already received an invitation. The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had been invited.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert and Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Alex Smalley.

The PGA of America has announced the field for next week's major at Valhalla, and Woods -- a four-time winner of the event, most recently in 2007 -- is listed among the contenders. The field includes 16 prior PGA champions and 33 major champions.\n\nIt also includes a LIV Golf champion -- Talor Gooch, who won LIV's individual title last season. Gooch had been outspoken in his condemnation of the majors for not inviting LIV players to their events, so much so that he won't even attempt to qualify for the U.S. Open or Open Championship.\n\nThe PGA of America, which has taken a more evenhanded approach toward LIV players than some other entities, decided to extend Gooch a special exemption, in addition to the invitation it made earlier to LIV's Joaquin Niemann. Neither Gooch nor Niemann qualified for the PGA under its typical qualification processes, which include victories on the PGA Tour or high standing in the Official World Golf Rankings. LIV's three-round, no-cut tournaments do not receive points from the OWGR, meaning LIV players do not have the opportunity to improve their rankings.\n\nMany LIV players had already qualified their way into the PGA Championship, either through prior victories at the PGA Championship -- like Phil Mickelson and defending champion Brooks Koepka -- or through strong performance at other recent majors, like Jon Rahm (2023 Masters winner), Cam Smith (2022 Open winner), Dustin Johnson (2020 Masters winner) and Bryson DeChambeau (2020 U.S. Open winner).\n\nAlso in the field: Michael Block, the PGA club pro who launched himself into history last year when he carded an ace, played alongside Rory McIlroy, and finished in the Top 15 at Oak Hill. That performance changed his life, and he'll be one of the stories to watch this year.\n\nBlock and 20 other club pros will round out the full field this year. Six will be playing in their first PGA Championship of their careers. Two spots will be reserved for winners at this week's PGA Tour events, the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic, if they are not already qualified.\n\nThe PGA Championship will take place May 16-19 at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. Previous PGA Championships at Valhalla took place in 1996 (winner: Mark Brooks), 2000 (Woods) and 2014 (McIlroy).

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nJoaquin Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, already received an invitation. The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "nwitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nwi.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_j_phillip@nwitimes.com", "name": "David J.

Woods set the consecutive-cuts-made record last month at the Masters before fading on the weekend to 60th, but left Augusta National optimistic for the rest of the majors this season.

His spot appears to underline the PGA of America's desire to have the strongest possible field in its major; Gooch was a three-time winner and LIV Golf's player of the year in 2023.\n\nLIV Golf's David Puig and Dean Burmester also received exemptions. Puig has won twice on the Asian Tour in the last seven months and is 106th in the world, while Burmester won back-to-back DP World tour events to end 2023 and won on LIV last month in Miami.\n\nThere are 15 LIV golfers in the field. Brooks Koepka is the defending PGA champion, a three-time PGA winner overall and coming in off a win last week in Singapore. Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Martin Kaymer, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed and Cameron Smith are other past major champions from LIV Golf in the field.\n\nScottie Scheffler, the world No. 1 who won last month at the Masters, is scheduled to compete but is on baby watch at home with wife Meredith. He is skipping this week's Wells Fargo Championship, a signature event on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs usual, the field also includes 20 PGA professionals who qualified via the annual PGA Professional Championship. The total PGA professional count is 21, as Michael Block returns after a T15 finish last year at Oak Hill which earned him a spot at Valhalla.\n\nThe winners of this week's Wells Fargo and Myrtle

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nJoaquin Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, already received an invitation. The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago. Among those left off the list was former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen, who won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour. He is No. 125 in the world.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Koepka also won the tournament in 2018 and 2019 and is in good form ahead of his defence after triumphing at last week's LIV event in Singapore.\n\nWoods, a 15-time major champion, won the PGA Championship in 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007, while world No 2 McIlroy emerged victorious in 2012 and 2014. The four-time major winner has yet to win a major since that 2014 tournament which was held at the very same Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky. A good omen, perhaps?\n\nThere is also the opportunity for Jordan Spieth to complete the career Grand Slam, the 30-year-old needing the Wanamaker Trophy to complete his set after his victories at The Masters and US Open in 2015 and The Open two years later.\n\nWorld No 5 Jon Rahm joins Koepka as part of a strong LIV Golf contingent named, which also includes former Open champion Cameron Smith and English hopeful Tyrrell Hatton.\n\nThey are among the 154 golfers named in the field by the PGA of America, with two remaining spots reserved for the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach Classic. Should a golfer who is already exempt emerge victorious at either event, additional players will be chosen from the alternates list.\n\nLIV Golf features 16 players in this year's PGA Championship field, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nAlong with Koepka, Rahm, Smith and Hatton mentioned above, that number includes seven 'special invitations' being extended to players from the Saudi-backed tour, ensuring that golf's entire top 100 in the world rankings will feature at Valhalla.\n\nThe PGA of America strives to have the world's top 100 participate in the tournament in order to maintain its reputation for having the strongest field of the four majors.\n\nThe PGA has used the catch-all category of 'special invitations' to include the likes of Patrick Reed, Joaquin Niemann and Talor Gooch.\n\n2018 Masters champion Reed's tied 12th finish at Augusta National this year moved him inside the top 100 to 92nd, while Niemann won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins to his name this year.\n\nGooch announced in a post on X on Monday, prior to the field being officially announced, that he had received an invitation.\n\nHis selection is perhaps a sign that the PGA of America's selection committee are looking specifically at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside of the Saudi league. He won three LIV events in 2023 on his way to topping their season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, and Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world, and David Puig at 106th in the rankings.\n\nThere might have been one more LIV golfer to feature, but for the fact former Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation due to \"personal commitments\", according to his manager.\n\nWatch the PGA Championship, exclusively live on Sky Sports Golf from May 16-19.

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nJoaquin Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, already received an invitation. The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European Tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals - 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nSINCE JOINING LIV, Gooch has played just two events that weren't on that circuit or were a major, and he didn't have a good result in either. He answered a question last week about potentially playing in qualifying events for the U.S. Open and British Open by bluntly indicating he had no intention of doing so.\n\nGooch sparked derision in golf circles earlier this year when he was quoted as saying of the 2024 Masters - to which he was not invited - \"If Rory McIlroy goes and completes his (career) Grand Slam without some of the best players in the world, there's just going to be an asterisk. It's just the reality. I think everybody wins whenever the majors figure out a way to get the best players in the world there.\" The Masters field ended up including 13 other LIV players, raising questions about whether Gooch's criterion for \"the best players in the world\" was a field with him in it.\n\nAs such, Gooch could find himself feeling an extra dose of pressure to perform well at the PGA Championship, which tees off next week. A one-time winner on the PGA Tour, he is coming off a fourth-place finish at a LIV event in Singapore.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Joaquin Niemann received it in early March, while Talor Gooch, David Puig, Adrian Meronk, Patrick Reed, Dean Burmester, and Lucas Herbert received them on Monday.\n\nPhil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka and Martin Kaymer are exempt for having won the PGA Championship before.

Tyrrell Hatton's exemption is due to qualifying for last season's PGA Tour TOUR Championship.\n\nThe final case is that of Andy Ogletree, who earned a spot in the 2024 PGA Championship thanks to being included in the top 3 of the International Federation Official World Golf Ranking List.\n\nThis is an initiative launched in 2023 to include in the event the top three ranked players in the world who play primarily on the Asian Tour, Japan Golf Tour, PGA Tour of Australasia, and the Sunshine Tour.\n\nA look at the rest of the PGA Championship field\n\nThe PGA Championship field will be made up of 156 players. In addition to the 16 LIV players, the following are already confirmed:\n\nOnly two positions in the field are pending to be defined.

That's a peculiar fact, however, given that it regularly has the strongest overall tournament field among the four majors, and in 2024 it's clear that the PGA is leaning into that advantage.\n\nThe PGA Championship is the only major championship that does not explicitly invite amateur players to compete. Instead, the PGA of America welcomes the top PGA professionals into the field via their qualifying through the PGA Professional Championship or an exemption from their performance in the previous year's tournament.\n\nThe PGA Championship has two other key factors it can use to its advantage as well in today's modern game: field size and special invites.\n\nThe Masters, for example, features the smallest field of all major championships, with fewer than 90 players teeing it up in last month's tournament, including five amateurs. The PGA Championship is essentially a completely opposite setup as it reserves the right to have a 156-player field.\n\nWith the additional spots to be awarded to professionals and the simple fact that the PGA of America can invite whoever it pleases - just as golf's other governing bodies can as well - it awards the PGA Championship the opportunity to essentially invite as many LIV players that it sees fit, and it's taken full advantage this year.\n\nThe field for next week's PGA Championship at Valhalla was released on Tuesday, and there were far more LIV players on the official list than many expected.\n\nSix LIV players who were not qualified for the PGA Championship received special invites from the PGA of America, including Talor Gooch, Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, Patrick Reed, and David Puig. In total, 15 LIV golfers are expected to tee it up at Valhalla.\n\nThe Masters featured just 13 LIV players, with Joaquin Niemann being the lone player from the Saudi-backed circuit to receive a special invite from Augusta National.\n\nWhile the six LIV players who received invites to play in this year's PGA Championship don't necessarily 'move the needle,' all six are undoubtedly among the 156 best players in the world. According to Data Golf, Herbert is the lowest-ranked player among invites sitting at 124th in its ranking system.\n\nWhile the PGA of America nor the PGA Championship will boast about being 'the major with the most LIV players in the field,' it's a no-brainer decision for them to give spots to as many LIV golfers they see fit while further solidifying themselves as having the strongest field of all the major championships.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Professional_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Professional Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Meronk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Meronk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Herbert_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Herbert (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/05/pga-liv-invites.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6470588235294117, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The players deserve the respect and should have received it from day one.\"\n\nThe PGA of America invited Gooch based on his performance at LIV Golf. He received no invitation to the Masters held in April and was also restricted from participating at the US Open last year due to an error.\n\nTalor Gooch earned $39.5 million from individual competitions along with an additional bonus of $18 million for ranking first as an individual at the end of the edition.\n\nLIV golfers will compete at the US PGA Championship at Valhalla\n\nThe 2024 PGA Championship will be held from May 16-19, 2024 at Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky. PGA of America announced the full field that will be seen competing at Valhalla next week, with two spots reserved for winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nLIV golfers Talor Gooch, Dean Burmester, Adrian Meronk, Lucas Herbert, David Puig and Patrick Reed will also be spotted as they have received exemptions to participate in the PGA Championship.\n\nOf all the players, Burmester has had the most success, winning back-to-back DP World Tour events in 2023 followed by his first LIV Golf title in Miami, propelling him to third place in the rankings for the season.\n\nThe one noticeable name missing from the LIV golf's list of invitations appears to be Louis Oosthuizen. He had two wins in the DP World Tour at the end of 2023 and finished runner-up twice in the breakaway league this year.\n\nThere will be a total of 15 LIV Golf players playing in the field of the US PGA Championship, which is two more than last month's Masters.\n\nLast year, Seth Waugh, the CEO of the PGA Championship, dismissed LIV's long-term viability and said (via bunkered.co.uk):\n\n\"I don't think people really care about it, And I don't see how it's a survivable business model. They can fund it for as long as they want to, but no matter how much money you have, at some point, burning it doesn't feel very good.\n\n\"I don't see they are accomplishing much. It seems logical to me, then, that you would work towards some sort of agreement. I hope the game comes back together in some form.\"\n\nGoing from that to offering 15 spots to LIV golfers, it seems like this year will be considered a significant victory for the Saudi league.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hetal_moleshri@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Hetal Moleshri", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greg Norman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Puig", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Puig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Meronk", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Meronk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Herbert_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Herbert (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/b9af0-17151006677935-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1015, "textEnd": 1021}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The players deserve the respect and should have received it from day one.\"\n\nHerbert, who joined the all-Australian Ripper GC this season and has tasted team success at the past two LIV events, will be one of six Australians in the field at Valhalla.\n\nHe'll join 2015 PGA winner Jason Day, Min Woo Lee, Cam Davis, Adam Scott and his LIV team captain Cam Smith, who needs a podium finish at least to get the rankings points boost he needs to keep his Olympic hopes alive.\n\nThere will be 16 LIV players in PGA field, which includes the world's 103 top-ranked golfers, and Tiger Woods.\n\nIt means that the major will be a true meeting of the best male golfers, something which fans have been starved of since the emergence of LIV Golf in 2022.\n\nHowever, given the PGA Tour is run separately from the year's four majors, the golf world is still a long way off achieving re-unification.\n\n\"Here's the thing: the majors were always gonna be fine,\" wrote PGA Tour insider Dan Rapaport. \"They can invite who they want. The Champions League of golf.\n\n\"It's the week-to-week product that suffers with this divide.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Woods, a 15-time major winner, has struggled to walk four rounds in tournaments since suffering severe leg injuries in a 2021 car crash but finished 60th in last month's Masters and says he hopes to play once a month through the US and British Opens.\n\nWoods, ranked 801, has accepted a special invitation into next month's US Open. He withdrew after three rounds in 2022 in his most recent PGA Championship start, skipping last year after ankle surgery.\n\nWoods and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland have each won PGA Championship titles at Valhalla -- Woods in 2000 and McIlroy in 2014 in his most recent major triumph.\n\nThe PGA field includes 33 major winners, 16 of them former PGA Championship winners.\n\nTwo vacancies remain in the field of 156, awaiting winners of this week's PGA Tour events if they are not already qualified for the showdown at Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe line-up includes top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, who won his second Masters title last month, and the rest of the top 103 players in the official world golf rankings.\n\nScheffler is skipping this week's PGA Tour signature event to be with wife Meredith as she prepares to have a baby.\n\nThe field includes 21 club professionals, 20 qualifiers and Michael Block, who returns after sharing 15th last year at

Some of the LIV players, however, qualified for this year's PGA Championship on the basis of their previous victory like Koepka and Phil Mickelson.\n\nA few of the LIV players have also qualified to play at Valhalla by putting a strong show at the other majors in recent years such as Jon Rahm winning 2023 Masters and Dustin Johnson winning it in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "wionews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WION"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.wionews.com/sites/default/files/2024/02/13/411790-tiger-woods.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 348, "textEnd": 357}], "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Currently ranked 801 in the world, Woods had previously accepted a special invitation into next month's US Open after the US Golf Association announced last week that the three-time tournament champion had been awarded an exemption in order to compete at Pinehurst.\n\nThe American finished 60th, last among those who made the cut, in last month's Masters, yet completed 72 holes in a major for the first time since his 2022 Masters comeback. Since 2013, Woods has finished 72 holes at the US Open only once, taking 21st in 2019, only two months after winning the Masters. He missed the cut in 2015, 2018 and 2020 and did not play in the remaining years. The last time he played in the PGA Championship in 2022, he withdrew after three rounds, skipping last year after ankle surgery.\n\nWoods and four-time major winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland have each won PGA Championship titles at Valhalla, who will host the tournament for the fourth time on May 16-19. The American won in 2000 and McIlroy celebrated in 2014, his most recent major triumph.\n\nThe PGA field includes 33 major winners, 16 of them former PGA Championship winners. Two vacancies remain in the field of 156, awaiting winners of this week's PGA Tour events if they are not already qualified for the showdown at Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe lineup includes top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, who won his second Masters title last month, and the rest of the top 103 players in the official world golf rankings. Scheffler is skipping this week's PGA Tour signature event to be with wife Meredith as she prepares to have a baby. Defending champion Brooks Koepka of the United States is among 16 players from the LIV Golf League who will compete in the year's second major tournament.\n\nOther LIV players from the world's top 100 include fifth-ranked Jon Rahm, England's 17th-ranked Tyrrell Hatton, Australia's Cameron Smith and Lucas Herbert, Poland's Adrian Meronk, Chile's Joaquin Niemann and American Patrick Reed. Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, figures to contend, while 94-ranked Rikuya Hoshino withdrew.\n\nBryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Martin Kaymer are also among those who have won in LIV events. American Talor Gooch, last year's LIV season champion, was surprisingly invited into his fifth consecutive PGA Championship. His best result was a share of 20th in 2022 but he missed the cut last year.\n\nThe field includes 21 club professionals, 20 qualifiers and Michael Block, who returns after sharing 15th last year at

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified.

Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nJoaquin Niemann, who won the Australian Open in December and has two LIV Golf wins this year, already received an invitation. The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, and Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in his home country of South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour. His manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of this weekend's Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field in the Wells Fargo at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, N.C., have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The biggest being defending champion Brooks Koepka, who heads to Valhalla having won his third PGA Championship at Oak Hill last year.\n\nOver half of the LIV quota heading to the event received invites from the PGA of America to compete, with their representation at the top of the world rankings dwindling amid the Saudi league's lack Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) recognition.\n\nREAD MORE: Luke Donald's Ryder Cup preparation speaks volumes amid Tiger Woods uncertainty\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy overcome LIV Golf problem as TGL replacement for Jon Rahm confirmed\n\nThe most notable name on the invite list is that of Gooch, who was initially ineligible to compete in any of the four majors in 2024 despite being crowned 2023 LIV champion last campaign. Including the American, here is a look at the seven invitees from the breakaway circuit.\n\nTalor Gooch\n\nStarting with Gooch, the LIV champion will compete at the PGA Championship for the fifth time in his career. He looked set to miss the trip to Kentucky thanks to his fall down the world rankings, with the three-time LIV winner currently sat in 644th in the list.\n\nThe Smash star has been vocal about his lack of major opportunity on the back of his career-best form on the Saudi-backed series, and he has finally been listened to by the powers that be at the PGA of America. Gooch's PGA Championship form is: CUT, T44, T20, CUT.\n\nPatrick Reed\n\nThe next big name to bank a PGA invite is Reed. Reed had announced himself as one of the best players in the world in the late 2010's, capping things off by being crowned Masters champion at Augusta National in 2018. His exemption as a major winner for this event ran out this year though, and with his own fall in the world rankings, he has been forced to rely on an invite this time around.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nPatrick Reed is heading to the PGA Championship\n\nReed has a solid record in the PGA Championship, boasting five top-20 finishes in nine outings, missing the cut just twice. His best performance came in 2017, when the LIV Golf star finished in a tie for second, two shots behind eventual champion Justin Thomas.\n\nJoaquin Niemann\n\nAlso on the LIV invite list is Joaquin Niemann. Niemann has more than made a name for himself in recent months, venturing away from the breakaway circuit in a bid to earn himself a spot in the four majors, which came with some success. After impressing throughout the end of 2023 and start of 2024, the Torque GC star was handed an invite to compete in last month's Masters.\n\nAnd this was mirrored by the PGA of America, after the current LIV Order of Merit leader was gifted a spot in next week's field. Niemann will also compete in the Open Championship in July, after he earned a place at Royal Troon after winning the Australian Open in December.\n\nAdrian Meronk\n\nNext on the list is a man who also competed in last month's Masters in Adrian Meronk. The 2023 DP World Tour Player of The Year is one of LIV Golf's latest recruits after making the Saudi switch in February this year, but like many, Meronk has already felt the effects of his move.\n\nHaving battled his way into the top-50 in the world rankings at the end of 2023, the Pole has now slipped back in the list, currently sitting 63rd. He will however still compete against the world's best in Kentucky next week, playing the PGA Championship for the second time in his career.\n\nAdrian Meronk has been invited to the PGA Championship David Puig\n\nOne LIV Golf star who will be making his debut at the PGA Championship is the in-form David Puig. Puig opted to turn to professional out of college in order to join the breakaway league, but it is efforts on the Asian Tour that have caught the eye of many.\n\nSince last season's International Series England event, Puig has three top-20s, four top 10s, and two victories on the Asian circuit, which has seen him move towards breaking into the top-100 in the world for the first time. His form has since been rewarded with an invite to Valhalla.\n\nLucas Herbert\n\nJoining Puig and co will be Lucas Herbert, who is another one of LIV's latest recruits. Joining Cam Smith's Ripper GC team in January, Herbert had previously played his golf across the PGA Tour and DP World Tour before committing to the Saudi-funded league. This however will not stop him making his fifth consecutive PGA Championship start, after being included on Tuesday's entry list.\n\nDean Burmester\n\nThe final invite handed out to those on the breakaway circuit came the way of Dean Burmester. The South African has impressed both on and off the LIV circuit so far this season, winning the Joburg Open on his return to the DP World Tour last November, before adding his first ever LIV Golf title in Miami last month.\n\nThese efforts have also been rewarded by the PGA of America, who have handed the big-hitting South African the chance to play in the second major championship of the year for the fourth-straight year.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lees@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Lees", "type": "author",

Those hopes ended late Tuesday when Rikuya Hoshino (No. 94) withdrew.\n\nThe PGA leans on a catch-all category of \"special invitations.\" The group of LIV players includes Patrick Reed, whose tie for 12th in the Masters moved him inside the top 100. He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nTags Sports Games And Toys Golf Music Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

While LIV Golf celebrated the news, many were surprised at how few invites LIV received. LIV golfers received 18 invites in 2023.\n\nAnd in a now-deleted tweet, two-time PGA Championship winner Phil Mickelson seemed to suggest that not inviting LIV golfers to participate in golf's major events could backfire. \"What about next year when more great players join (LIV),\" Mickelson tweeted. Implying that keeping LIV golfers out would ultimately backfire on the PGA.\n\nLIV's Brooks Koepka is the reigning PGA Championship winner, and an odds-on favorite to repeat. And no doubt, Jon Rahm, the world No. 5, will make a run. Nonetheless, there's a good chance that LIV, for all its bluster, could get overshadowed, and not just because they might falter as a group, like what happened at this year's Masters.\n\nFirst off, Tiger Woods is set to play. The four-time PGA champion won at this course in 2000. Viewers will tune in to see Tiger more than LIV. Jordan Spieth is looking to complete the career Grand Slam. And despite his performance at the Master's, where he finished +4, Rory McIlroy drew the crowds. And he won the PGA Championship at Valhalla in 2014. Oh yes, and world number 1 Scottie Scheffler is currently resting as he looks to continue his domination. All of these stories have the potential to overshadow any and all LIV-related storylines.\n\nDespite Phil Mickelson's assertion, at least for this year there appears to be enough overall talent, enough talent in the pipeline, enough competing stories, and enough top PGA golfers, that this could potentially become a make-or-break scenario for LIV. If they perform poorly, or merely adequately, as a group, the major's may not need to fear losing sponsors or viewers if they don't invite LIV golfers. The PGA Championship field list is strong, simply put.\n\nCertainly the PGA Championship wants to maintain its reputation for having the world's very best golfers in the tournament. So why then would LIV's Talor Gooch, currently rated No. 644 in the world, get a special exemption to play? Because, as SI's John Schwarb suggests, the PGA is willing to overlook Official World Golf Rankings. True. Since joining LIV Golf in 2022, Gooch has been one of the league's best, even being named LIV Golf's player of the year in 2023. While playing little outside of LIV.\n\nGooch's selection seems to suggest that the PGA are closely monitoring LIV golfer performance, at least individual performance. The Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) does not recognize LIV events in their rankings methodology. For example, Patrick Reed's streak of 40 consecutive majors starts, going back to 2014, was in danger of ending. But the LIV golfer ultimately received a special exemption to play the PGA Championship. As Kerry Haigh, the managing director of championship for the PGA of America, has stated, \"if players are deserving, hopefully we would invite them,\" even if their OWGR doesn't officially merit an invitation. While fans of LIV Golf are generally pleased that sixteen players got exemptions, the reliance on multiple lists, special invitations, and veiled threats-from both sides-is not helping.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_s_hall@heavy.com", "name": "Brian S Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1749086238_95ea26-e1715130103867.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 81, "textEnd": 87}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

This year, 16 players - including defending 2023 champion Brooks Koepka - will try to make it two in a row for the Saudi-backed tour.\n\nThe 2024 PGA Championship will take place May 16-19 at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky and it will be the second time in a row that 16 LIV Golf players are participating in the event. The crop of LIV Golf players also includes other previous champions who won the event when they were members of the PGA Tour.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the LIV Golf players competing at the 2024 PGA Championship.\n\nWho are the LIV Golf players competing at the 2024 PGA Championship?\n\nHere's the list of the 16 LIV Golf players who will compete in the 2024 PGA Championship, in alphabetical order:\n\nDean Burmester, 34, Stinger GCBryson DeChambeau, 30, Crushers GCTalor Gooch, 32, Smash GCTyrrell Hatton, 32, Legion XIIILucas Herbert, 28, Ripper GCDustin Johnson, 39, 4Aces GCMartin Kaymer, 39, Cleeks GC* (2010)Brooks Koepka, 34, Smash GC* (2018, 2019, 2023)Adrian Meronk, 30, Cleeks GCPhil Mickelson, 53, HyFlyers GC* (2005, 2021)Joaquin Niemann, 25, Torque GCAndy Ogletree, 26, HyFlyers GCDavid Puig, 22, Fireballs GCJon Rahm, 29, Legion XIIIPatrick Reed, 33, 4Aces GCCameron Smith, 30, Ripper GC\n\n*denotes previous PGA Championship title\n\nHow can I watch the PGA Championship?\n\nThe PGA Championship will take place starting Thursday, May 16 and will run through Sunday, May 19. Thursday and Friday's coverage will be available on ESPN and ESPN+, while the morning coverage on Saturday and Sunday will be on ESPN and ESPN+ and the afternoon coverage on Saturday and Sunday will be on CBS and Paramount+.\n\nWhat is the LIV Golf Invitational Series?\n\nThe LIV Golf Invitational Series made its debut in June 2022 after the tour lured some notable players from the PGA Tour such as Phil Mickelson and Dustin Johnson. Others like Brooks Koepka, the winner of the most recent PGA Championship, Bryson DeChambeau and Cameron Smith have since joined. The LIV tour presented a disruption in the dynamics of the sport.\n\nWhy is LIV Golf so controversial?\n\nThe Public Investment Fund (PIF), the sovereign wealth investment fund of Saudi Arabia and one of the largest in the world, has backed and is financing LIV Golf Investments, the parent company of LIV Golf. As the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman is the head of the PIF. According to a declassified U.S. intelligence report released in February 2021, Salman approved an operation \"to capture or kill\" Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi inside a Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018.\n\nThe Saudi government is accused of other human rights violations and has invested in Western athletic opportunities in an apparent attempt to improve its image, a practice known as \"sportswashing.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: PGA Championship 2024 field to include 16 LIV Golf players", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news",

Now, the 22-year-old Kiwi has a chance to share the stage with the legendary American golfer at the 2024 PGA Championship. He has joined the PGA of America's late invitee list along with two LIV Golfers - Talor Gooch and David Puig.\n\nKobori was rewarded with the Challenger PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit accolade last season. Interestingly, his predecessor David Micheluzzi, also received a special invite to last year's second major.\n\nKobori received a special invitation for his sensational triumphs on the PGA Tour of Australasia. The golfer was informed about his invite on early Tuesday morning. If the PGA of America had not sent a special invite to the World No. 432 for the Valhalla competition, he would make his major debut at the 2024 Open Championship. However, it seems like Christmas has come early for the 22-year-old Kiwi golfer.\n\nIt will be intriguing to see what the young gun has under his sleeves when he faces the best golfers at the 2024 PGA Championship next week.\n\nBefore the PGA of America announced the official field list for the 106th edition of the PGA Championship, eight LIV golfers were already eligible to compete at the major which included Brooks Koepka, Tyrrell Hatton, Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Martin Kaymer, Cameron Smith, and Jon Rahm. Following that, in March 2024, Joaquin Niemann also ended up receiving a special invite for the major.\n\nBefore Tuesday, only nine LIV Golfers were set to play at Valhalla Golf Course next week. However, after the official field was announced, the number of players from the Saudi-backed league increased to 16.\n\nAlthough the PGA of America announced the field on Tuesday, the League's 2023 Individual Champion Talor Gooch leaked the information out of excitement on his X handle. Now, as per the updated field, Lucas Herbert, Dean Burmester, Adrian Meronk, David Puig, Andy Ogletree, and Patrick Reed will also be joining Gooch in the upcoming major championship.\n\nInterestingly, the number of LIV golfers at the PGA Championship is three times more than the ones who participated at the 2024 Masters. Last year, Brooks Koepka became the first LIV golfer to win a major after he won the PGA Championship title last year.

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "lacrossetribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Crosse Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_j_phillip@lacrossetribune.com", "name": "David J.

Koepka topped the PGA Championship field at Oak Hill Country Club a year ago for his fifth major victory. However, he is just 12-1 to win in the 2024 PGA Championship odds because of the fierce competition he faces. Scottie Scheffler was a runner-up at last year's PGA Championship, but he is the 4-1 favorite in the 2024 PGA Championship field coming off a victory at the Masters. Jon Rahm is next among the 2024 PGA Championship golfers at 10-1, and Rory McIlroy, who is still looking for his first win of the season, is 12-1.\n\nBefore locking in any 2024 PGA Championship picks of your own, entering PGA DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings or FanDuel, or finalizing PGA Championship props and PGA Championship Pick Six entries, be sure to see the 2024 PGA Championship golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up almost $10,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and The Players Championship this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the PGA Championship 2024 field taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 PGA Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2024 PGA Championship: Brooks Koepka, a three-time PGA champion and one of the favorites, stumbles and doesn't even crack the top 10. Koepka has five major tournament wins on his resume and a reputation for elevating his level of play in big events. However, his last two major starts haven't gone well as he was 45th at the Masters, which followed a 64th-place finish at last year's Open Championship. He's failed to shoot par in each of his last seven rounds at major tournaments.\n\nAfter notching three tournament wins in 2023, including last year's PGA Championship, it has been tough sledding for Koepka in 2024. He has no victories, or even top-fives, and across his six starts, he has three times as many finishes outside the top 25 (three) as he has inside the top 10 (one). He played Valhalla at the 2014 PGA Championship and finished in a tie for 15th place, but that placement ranks just eighth out of his 11 career PGA Championship starts.\n\nAnother surprise: Will Zalatoris, a 25-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The San Francisco native is rebounding this season after a back injury derailed his 2023 campaign and has three top-10 finishes heading into the month of May. He finished second at the Genesis invitational, fourth at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and was impressive in his ninth-place finish at the Masters earlier this month.\n\nZalatoris has proven in the past he can turn his game up at major events and finished in the top 10 in the PGA Championship twice in his career, including a second-place finish in 2022. He ranks ninth on the PGA Tour in strokes gained: approach to green (0.694) which could give him an advantage at Valhalla for the 2024 PGA Championship. See who else to pick here.\n\nHow to make 2024 PGA Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds longer than 20-1 to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 PGA Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

His first victory came on April 23, 2023, when he beat Anirban Lahiri to win LIV Golf Adelaide by a margin of three strokes. This victory was the beginning of a special year for Gooch.\n\nImmediately after his victory down under, Gooch participated in LIV Golf Singapore on April 30, 2023. Like Adelaide, Singapore also yielded fruitful results for the 32-year-old golfer as he beat Sergio Garcia in the playoffs to win the competition.\n\nFollowing his victory in Singapore, Talor Gooch had to wait almost a month before securing his third title on the LIV Golf Tour.

Given the fact that he did not do anything to qualify for the event, this invitation shocked many fans and pundits alike.\n\nRegardless, the 32-year-old decided to grab this opportunity with both hands.

The tournament scheduled to take place from May 16th at the Valhalla course, will feature Tiger Woods and the world's top 100 players.\n\nWoods, the 15-time major champion, will be making his fourth start at the Valhalla. His playoff win at this course in 2000 saw him defend his PGA Championship. This was his third straight major win which eventually saw him complete the \"Tiger Slam\" after he won the Masters in 2001.\n\nHis previous appearance at this site was one to forget though. In 2014, Woods shot successive rounds of 74 while playing with a some pain in the back and ended up missing the cut.\n\nThe news of Tiger Woods playing in this major event comes a few days after he received a special exemption from the USGA to play in the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in June. Woods had failed to qualify for the U.S. Open due to his OWGR rankings.\n\nThe exemption that he received from winning the 2019 Masters had also expired. This left him with no other possible ways to appear in the third major of the year. With the Open Championship allowing the past champions to play till the age of 55, the 48-year-old golfer is now on pace to play in all four majors of the year.\n\nThis year the PGA Championship field boasts arguably the strongest field with all of the top 100 players in the World Rankings set to tee off next week. A total of 156 players have been named for this tournament, meaning Brooks Koepka, the defending champion, will have to bring out his A game if he wants to claim his sixth major next week.\n\nBrooks Koepka aiming to repeat back-to-back wins at the PGA Championship\n\nWith the 106th PGA Championship on the horizon, five-time major champion Brooks Koepka is eyeing history. He is aiming to repeat back-to-back wins at the PGA Championship this year as he hopes to defend his crown which he won last year at Oak Hill.\n\nKoepka's win in May last year him become the first LIV Golf star to claim victory at a PGA Tour event. The four-time LIV Golf winner thinks it would be \"cool\" if he went back-to-back just like he did it if before in the years 2018 and 2019.\n\nIn 2018, Koepka claimed his second straight U.S. Open title and won the PGA Championship as well. He went on to retain the PGA Championship crown in 2019 at Bethpage and thus went back-to-back in two different major championships.\n\nIf Koepka is successful next week, he will become just the second golfer after Tiger Woods to claim successive wins at the PGA Championships on two separate occasions. Woods first won the title in 1999 and defended it successfully in 2000. He later went on to win this event in 2006 and 2007. With momentum on his side following the win in Singapore, it will be interesting to see how Koepka performs.\n\nIn case you missed it:", "source": {"uri": "firstsportz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FirstSportz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tiger-Woods-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 291, "textEnd": 299}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Thank you for the invitation @PGA. See y'all there.\"\n\nAnother LIV star, Joaquin Niemann, has also received a call up to a major that seeks to pack its field with the world's best players as a counterweight to the 21 club pros who also compete.\n\nThe four majors - the Masters, PGA, US Open and Open - are the main beneficiaries of the current split in the men's game.\n\nThese are the only tournaments where all of the best players come together to compete for the biggest prizes. This is why it is important for the PGA to invite the likes of Gooch and Niemann - who was also invited to the Masters.\n\nBoth golfers are deemed to have shown sufficient form to warrant inclusion, despite plummeting world rankings because of LIV's lack of recognition in the official standings.\n\nNiemann won the Australian Open and sought to garner world ranking points in various events during LIV's off season to help preserve the Chilean's major status. This effort did not go unnoticed.\n\nGooch, who became a father for the second time last January, was less enthusiastic. A tie for 42nd in the Hong Kong Open last November was his only excursion away from the Saudi Arabian-funded tour.\n\nBoth the US Open and Open Championship offer routes into their fields through qualifying and the American tournament also offers the occasional invitation, as they have done for three-time winner Tiger Woods this year.\n\nGooch would have been in the US Open in 2023, finishing in the top 30 on the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup list before signing for LIV. But a clause stating that a top 30 player must also be eligible for the Tour Championship scuppered his hopes.\n\nSuspended by the PGA Tour for defecting, he became ineligible for the 2022 season-ending tournament in Atlanta and therefore lost the chance to compete in his national championship the following year.\n\nYet this US golfer earned in excess of $34m on the LIV tour in 2023. He won three of their tournaments and lost in a play-off to Koepka in another and was crowned individual champion at the end of the tour's second season.\n\nGooch is not minded to try to qualify for the remaining majors this year - which is curious. It might prompt some to question whether his ambitions might be more driven by monetary concerns than a desire for sporting glory?\n\nThen again, money has always been a key driving force in the professional game - the clue is in the pro bit.\n\nNevertheless, since moving to LIV, Gooch has acquired a reputation for eyebrow raising observations. After their Portland tournament in July 2022 he compared the atmosphere with the Ryder Cup - a match he has never played.\n\nThen before last month's Masters, referring to his absence at Augusta, he observed: \"If Rory McIlroy goes and completes his Grand Slam without some of the best players in the world, there's just going to be an asterisk. It's just the reality.\"\n\nWell we can all breathe easy that Gooch will be at Valhalla. There will be no questioning the validity of the eventual winner given that this Oklahoma native, a man with zero top-10 major finishes, is in the field.\n\nIndeed, while Gooch was compiling his stellar LIV season last year, he comfortably missed cuts at The Open and the PGA after finishing a lowly 34th at the Masters. He has not broken 70 at a major since a final-round 69 at the 2022 Open.\n\nSo it will be fascinating to see how he fares next week. Golf has such vagaries that it can be harsh to say someone has to justify themselves in any given event - but that pressure will surely be there for Gooch in Louisville.\n\nThe PGA has deemed him worthy of inclusion in its field and how someone, who has three LIV top-10s to his name this season but no wins, compares with the world's best could be enlightening.\n\nThe sample size of LIV events is still too small to know whether 54-hole, no cut, shotgun starts against the same competitors improves these players.\n\nKoepka showed 12 months ago that a LIV player can still lift one of the biggest trophies in the game - but is he an outlier? Having won in Singapore last week the US star is in form before next week's defence, but is he as good as he was 12 months ago?\n\nThe number of LIV players eligible for majors continues to dwindle. Patrick Reed ends a 40-tournament run on the biggest stages because the benefits of his 2018 Masters win are now exhausted beyond Augusta.\n\nIt is impossible to know whether Reed's golf remains worthy of major status. With only one LIV top-10 this season and lying 30th of their 55 players, probably not.\n\nBut last month he did finish tied 12th at the Masters and, aged 33, Reed should be in the prime of his career. Instead he will have a week off while the best in the world contest the Wanamaker Trophy in Kentucky.\n\nGooch's mission, surely, is to show that he belongs in such company.", "source": {"uri":

These names include defending champion Brooks Koepka and former champions Martin Kaymer and Phil Mickelson. Major champions in the past five seasons like Cameron Smith, Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm, and Bryson DeChambeau have also received an invite.\n\nTyrrell Hatton received an invitation for finishing in the top 15 at the last PGA Championship as well as being among the top 100-ranked players. Joaquin Niemann is another player from the Saudi-backed circuit who has earned a special invite to the tournament.\n\nThe number of LIV Golf professionals at this year's PGA Championship is lower compared to last year when 16 such players competed. While Koepka won the championship, DeChambeau (T4) and Smith (T9) finished inside the top 10. Only five of the LIV stars failed to make the cut at the tournament.\n\nEven at the Masters Tournament last month, 13 players from the Saudi-backed circuit were part of the playing field, and three of them finished inside the top 10.\n\nHow have invited LIV golfers performed at the PGA Championship in the past?\n\nAmong the 11 invited LIV Golf stars, Brooks Koepka has the best record at the PGA Championship. He is a three-time champion here, including last year's win. Overall, he has six top-10s in 11 starts at the event.\n\nPhil Mickelson has won the PGA Championship twice in his career. In 2021, he became the oldest Major champion at the age of 50 years and 11 months old. Besides his two wins, he also has two runner-up finishes and six other top-10 finishes at the tournament.\n\nMartin Kaymer won the PGA Championship in 2014 but has only three top-10s in 14 starts. Jon Rahm has two top-10s in seven starts, while Tyrrell Hatton also has a couple of top-10 finishes in nine starts.

Niemann also received a special invitation to the Masters -- Augusta National cited his victory in the Australian Open without mentioning his LIV victory in February.\n\nGooch said last week in Singapore he had no intention of joining more than 30 LIV players who plan on trying to qualify for the U.S. Open.

Tiger Woods is a 15-time major champion who just set a record by making his 24th cut in a row at the 2024 Masters. Now, he'll look to replicate his past success at Valhalla Golf Club, where he won the 2000 PGA Championship. How will Tiger's body hold up to another grueling week against the best players in the world and which 2024 PGA Championship contenders should be on your radar?\n\nWoods is scheduled to play and is a 125-1 longshot in the 2024 PGA Championship odds, while Scottie Scheffler is the 3-1 favorite after his win at Augusta. Jon Rahm (10-1), Rory McIlroy (10-1), Brooks Koepka (12-1) and Ludvig Aberg (12-1) round out the top five in the PGA odds board for the second major championship of the season. Before locking in your 2024 PGA Championship picks or Tiger Woods props, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up almost $10,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and The Players Championship this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the PGA Championship 2024 field taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 PGA Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise: Collin Morikawa, a 22-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 27-year-old Californian is already a six-time PGA Tour winner and a two-time major champion, winning the 2020 PGA Championship at TPC Harding Park and the 2021 Open Championship at Royal St. George's.\n\nMorikawa is currently ranked No. 13 in the Official World Golf Ranking and 11th in the FedEx Cup standings after following up his t-3rd at the Masters with a solo ninth at the RBC Heritage. He's made the cut all four times that he's played the PGA Championship and he's finished top 10 in eight of his 17 career major championship starts.\n\nThe model has also examined where Tiger Woods finishes. The 48-year-old made the cut at Augusta but the wheels fell off over the weekend and he'd go on to finish 60th overall out of 60 players who survived the cut. However, he'll have the luxury of playing another course where he's had a lot of success.\n\nHe won the PGA Championship at Valhalla in 2000 but missed the cut when it was held on the same course in 2014. However, Tiger did just finish his first four-round PGA Tour event since the 2023 Genesis Invitational at Augusta last month and he'll be looking to build off that as he continues to try to tailor his game to his physical limitations.

Mark Brooks (1996), Tiger Woods (2000) and Rory McIlroy (2014) have all won PGA Championships at Valhalla throughout the years and the club also hosted the 2008 Ryder Cup, with Team USA winning 16.5-11.5. Now, the esteemed Jack Nicklaus design will take center stage again when the PGA Championship 2024 begins on Thursday, May 16. Scottie Scheffler is the hottest player in golf after winning four of his last five starts, including earning his second green jacket at the 2024 Masters. Scheffler is the 4-1 favorite in the 2024 PGA Championship odds, followed by Jon Rahm (9-1), McIlroy (10-1), Ludvig Aberg (16-1) and Brooks Koepka (16-1).\n\nBefore locking in any 2024 PGA Championship picks of your own, entering PGA DFS lineups on sites like DraftKings or FanDuel, or finalizing PGA Championship props and PGA Championship Pick Six entries, be sure to see the 2024 PGA Championship golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine through your free CBS Sports account here.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up almost $10,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and The Players Championship this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the PGA Championship 2024 field taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Join SportsLine using your CBS Sports account now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 PGA Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise the model is calling for at the 2024 PGA Championship: Brooks Koepka, a three-time PGA champion and one of the favorites, stumbles and doesn't even crack the top 10. Koepka has five major tournament wins on his resume and a reputation for elevating his level of play in big events. However, his last two major starts haven't gone well as he was 45th at the Masters, which followed a 64th-place finish at last year's Open Championship. He's failed to shoot par in each of his last seven rounds at major tournaments.\n\nAfter notching three tournament wins in 2023, including last year's PGA Championship, it has been tough sledding for Koepka in 2024. He has no victories, or even top-fives, and across his six starts, he has three times as many finishes outside the top 25 (three) as he has inside the top 10 (one). He played Valhalla at the 2014 PGA Championship and finished in a tie for 15th place, but that placement ranks just eighth out of his 11 career PGA Championship starts.\n\nAnother surprise: Bryson DeChambeau, a 30-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. The 30-year-old has won two worldwide events in the last calendar year and piled up five top-10 finishes in seven starts during the 2024 season, including a sixth-place finish at the Masters last month.\n\nNow, the 2020 U.S. Open champion will get another crack at a PGA Championship after finishing fourth at Oak Hill last year. DeChambeau overcame a two-shot deficit entering the final round at Winged Foot to win his U.S. Open by a staggering six shots and the bomber has go-low potential as he sets his sights on Valhalla. He gained strokes against the field in three of the four main categories at the Masters and he'll look to turn in another well-rounded performance at the 2024 PGA Championship.

He doesn't need a lot of words", "body": "Individual champion Captain Brooks Koepka, right, of Smash GC, celebrates after his win with his wife Jena Sims, center, and son Crew, left, on the 18th green after the final round of LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Sentosa, Singapore.\n\nBrooks Koepka leaves the bluster to everyone else at LIV Golf. He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@hjnews.com",

He doesn't need a lot of words - WTOP News", "body": "Brooks Koepka leaves the bluster to everyone else at LIV Golf. He cares about only his golf, especially when it's...\n\nBrooks Koepka leaves the bluster to everyone else at LIV Golf. He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The PGA Championship moved from the major finale in August to the second of the season in May, in 2019. Then 2020 came and the golf calendar was reorganized because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The PGA was contested again in August, after the U.S. Open and ahead of the Masters. Things returned to order in '21 and, for the foreseeable future, the PGA of America's crown jewel sits in its spring spot.\n\nWait, isn't this the championship of the PGA Tour?\n\nSigh. No, this is not the championship of the PGA Tour. That would be considered The Players Championship. This is the championship of the PGA of America.\n\nWhy the need to designate \"of America\"? What else would it be - the PGA of Timbuktu?\n\nObviously we need a history lesson here. We'll keep it as brief as possible. There used to be one PGA - the \"of America\" one, which was founded in 1916. In 1968, action was begun that resulted in an eventual split into the PGA of America and the PGA Tour.\n\nWhy the split?\n\nThe original golf pros were the people who work at golf clubs. You know, the ones who sell us logoed ball markers and take our green fees when they're not trying to cure our slices by giving us lessons. The better players among them also played the national tournament circuit.\n\nAs golf grew in popularity and tournaments became more lucrative, a class of pros evolved who were tournament players first and foremost. If they held a club job, it was often ceremonial.\n\nOver time, more of these pros discarded the idea of working at a club at all, instead devoting full time to tournament play.\n\nOK, I follow you so far.\n\nSo now you had one organization, the PGA of America, trying to represent the interests of two entirely different types of \"golf pros.\" No surprise that the root of the dispute was money, specifically what to do with what was becoming a windfall in rights fees from the TV networks. The tournament players, a group that included Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer, wanted that money to go to increased tournament purses, while the club pros wanted it to go into the PGA's general fund. Eventually the touring pros broke off on their own. The PGA of America remained in place, representing the traditional \"club\" pros.\n\nIf the PGA of America was no longer going to represent the interests of tournament players, why does it still have a championship? And why is it a major?\n\nIt wanted to keep the PGA Championship alive for many reasons, not the least of which is that it generates considerable revenue. As for your second question, that is a big ol' can of worms for another day. We will say this, however. For most of the PGA Championship's existence, it has had a justifiable status as a major. Whether that will ever change, whether it will ever be replaced in the major rotation by The Players Championship is anyone's guess. But golf is a game that respects - and clings to - tradition.\n\nAnything else about its history that sets it apart?\n\nThe most obvious thing is that from its inception in 1916 through 1957, the PGA was a match-play tournament. It has been periodically suggested that it return to match play, but that is not considered likely. Prior to the shift to May in 2019, it was previously held during this month in 1949, when Sam Snead won.\n\nPGA Championship past winners: Full year-by-year look at every champion\n\nAll of the PGA Championship winners since the men's major first began in 1916.\n\nWe get the May thing, but why no longer match play?\n\nWorst-case scenario - all the highly seeded \"name\" players get eliminated before the final. If you're a TV network that has spent big bucks to televise this event, do you want two guys you're never heard of in the final?\n\nSpeaking of the final, what's the name of the winner's trophy?\n\nIt's called the Wanamaker Trophy, and it was named after Rodman Wanamaker, a department store magnate who was influential in the formation of the PGA.\n\n*Note: PGA Championship points are based on official PGA Tour earnings.\n\nI probably should have asked this a lot earlier, but what does PGA stand for?\n\nProfessional Golfers' Association. Remember, in the early years of the 20th century, pros were looked down upon. It was only natural that they band together under one umbrella organization.\n\nLet's get to the tournament itself. The Masters has Jack Nicklaus winning at age 46 in 1986 and Tiger Woods' remarkable turns in '97 and '19. The U.S. Open has 20-year-old Francis Ouimet upsetting two of the top British pros in 1913 and Arnold Palmer's charge in 1960. The Open Championship has the Duel in the Sun in 1977 and Woods destroying the field in 2000. So, what have been the most memorable PGAs?\n\nIt would be hard to beat a then-unknown John Daly winning in 1991. He got into the tournament as ninth - ninth! - alternate, then torched the course with a combination of absurdly long driving and incredible touch around the greens. Then there was Bob Tway holing a final-hole bunker shot to beat Greg Norman in 1986 - something we didn't yet know would become a trend. And who could have predicted that the player who would give Woods his toughest test would be one of his former junior-golf rivals, Bob May, who did everything except beat him in 2000? And, of course, there was 2021, when Phil Mickelson, at age 51, became the oldest-ever major champion.\n\nWhat happened last year?\n\nBrooks Koepka won his third Wanamaker trophy at Oak Hill Country Club in Pittsford, New York. The LIV Golf player shot 72-66-66-67 to win by two shots over Viktor Hovland and Scottie Scheffler.\n\nWho has won the most PGA Championships?\n\nNicklaus and Walter Hagen have each won five times. Woods has won four times. Woods has twice won back-to-back in this major, in 1999-2000 and 2006-07.\n\nWhere are they playing?\n\nValhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky. The venue is owned by the PGA of America and has hosted three PGA Championships. Mark Brooks won in a playoff over Kenny Perry in 1996. Tiger Woods prevailed in a playoff over Bob May in 2000. And, Rory McIlroy beat Phil Mickelson by a stroke in 2014. Valhalla also hosted the 2008 Ryder Cup, won by the U.S.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Explained", "body": "The PGA Championship is a Major tournament, which means the field is usually as full as it can possibly be. From former winners and other qualifiers, there are tons of ways to get into the event, but not as many apply to club pros. Club professionals are golfers who being senior pros, either run golf clubs themselves or teach others, like Michael Block, for example.\n\n21 club professionals will be part of the 2024 PGA Championship field, including the 2024 PGA Professional Championship winner, Ben Polland. The golfer will lead the Corebridge Financial Team.\n\nThe PGA of America, the sponsor for this Major tournament, fills the 20 spots for club professionals based on the top finishers at the PGA Professional Championship, leaving room for 21 players to get into the field.\n\nWhich club pros are in the PGA Championship?\n\nThe fact that the PGA of America provides an opportunity for several players who otherwise would not get into the field, such as Michael Block, allows for a more interesting tournament.\n\nHe is part of this year's club pros team, the Corebridge Financial Team. He and Ben Polland, leading the team in 2024, are joined by:\n\nMany of these players will be in their first-ever PGA Championship. Generally speaking, these club pros don't make as much of an impact at the tournament, since they're not technically pro golfers on the PGA Tour, DP World Tour, or LIV Golf.\n\nHowever, sometimes, they do make noise. Block's run at the 2023 PGA Championship where he not only made the cut but finished tied for 15th place comes to mind.\n\nMost of these players hold jobs in and around golf. For example, Wyatt Worthington II is a PGA Golf Manufacturer Sales Representative at Eastside Golf. Braden Shattuck is the PGA Director of Instruction at Rolling Green Golf Club.\n\nThis gives them a unique perspective and knowledge of the sport, and the PGA of America aims to give them a chance to play in the tournament. They are hard pressed to compete with Brooks Koepka, Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, and others, but they are given a shot at competing.\n\nMany of these players do play in professional tournaments. For example, Braden Shattuck was in the field for the Corales Puntacana Championship. He missed the cut but was one shot under par.\n\nSo even though they do play some tournaments from time to time, it's hard to qualify for a Major that way. Unless they win one close in schedule to a Major tournament, they're not going to get in very easily, but the PGA of America steps in to give them a shot to see what they can do.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Block", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Block"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Professional_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Professional Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corales_Puntacana_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corales Puntacana Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/739df-17149957301434-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

He doesn't need a lot of words", "body": "Brooks Koepka hits from the 10th tee during the final round of LIV Golf Singapore on Sunday.\n\nBrooks Koepka leaves the bluster to everyone else at LIV Golf. He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by winning his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work and, hopefully, something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months -- against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field, and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out. Three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16-under) at Erin Hills and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully, looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times: the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@triblive.com", "name": "Doug Ferguson", "type": "author",

The 2024 PGA Championship will be the fourth held at Valhalla and past winners include Mark Brooks (1996), Tiger Woods (2000) and Rory McIlroy (2014). Will we see another dominant superstar like Woods or McIlroy win in 2024 or will we see another under-the-radar pro earn a breakthrough win in the 2024 PGA Championship field like Brooks did in 1996? Scottie Scheffler has won four of the last five times he's teed it up and is the 4-1 favorite in the 2024 PGA Championship odds following a dominant win at Augusta.\n\nMcIlroy is 10-1 in the PGA Championship 2024 odds for the year's second major, while Woods is a 125-1 longshot as he continues to play a limited schedule. Before locking in your 2024 PGA Championship picks or Tiger Woods props, be sure to see the golf predictions and projected leaderboard from the proven computer model at SportsLine.\n\nOur proprietary model, built by DFS pro Mike McClure, has been red-hot since the PGA Tour resumed in June of 2020. In fact, the model is up almost $10,000 on its best bets since the restart, nailing tournament after tournament.\n\nMcClure's model correctly predicted Scottie Scheffler would finish on top of the leaderboard at the 2024 Masters, the Arnold Palmer Invitational, and The Players Championship this season. McClure also included Hideki Matsuyama in his best bets to win the 2024 Genesis Invitational. That bet hit at +9000, and for the entire tournament, McClure's best bets returned nearly $1,000.\n\nThe model also predicted Jon Rahm would be victorious at the 2023 Sentry Tournament of Champions and The American Express. At the 2023 Masters, the model was all over Rahm's second career major victory heading into the weekend. Rahm was two strokes off the lead heading into the third round, but the model still projected him as the winner. It was the second straight Masters win for the model, which also nailed Scheffler winning in 2022.\n\nIn addition, McClure's best bets included Nick Taylor (70-1) winning the 2023 RBC Canadian Open, Jason Day (17-1) winning outright at the 2023 AT&T Byron Nelson, and Rickie Fowler (14-1) finishing on top of the leaderboard at the 2023 Rocket Mortgage Classic.\n\nThis same model has also nailed a whopping 11 majors entering the weekend and hit the Masters three straight years. Anyone who has followed it has seen massive returns.\n\nNow with the PGA Championship 2024 field taking shape, SportsLine simulated the tournament 10,000 times, and the results were surprising. Head to SportsLine now to see the projected leaderboard.\n\nTop 2024 PGA Championship predictions\n\nOne major surprise: Will Zalatoris, a 25-1 longshot, makes a strong run at the title. He's a target for anyone looking for a huge payday. Zalatoris is back up to No. 30 in the Official World Ranking after falling outside the top 50 while recovering from a significant back injury he suffered in 2023.\n\nThe 27-year-old won the 2022 FedEx St. Jude Championship for his first career PGA Tour victory and has become a fixture near the top of the leaderboard at major championships in recent years. Zalatoris has made 11 career starts in majors and finished in the top 10 on seven occasions, including a solo second finish at the 2022 PGA Championship and runner-up finishes at the 2021 Masters and 2022 U.S. Open.\n\nThe model has also examined where Tiger Woods finishes. The 48-year-old is a 15-time major champion and his 82 PGA Tour wins are tied with Sam Snead for the most in tour history. However, since suffering a car accident that caused a compound fracture and left him with arthritis in his left leg, Woods has played sparingly. He's only teed it up seven times worldwide in the last two years and had to withdraw from three of those events due to illness or injury.\n\nWoods made the cut at the Masters for the 24th time in a row last month, breaking the record for more consecutive cuts made at Augusta National Golf Club. He'll also have intimate knowledge of Valhalla, having won the 2000 PGA Championship there. Woods returned to Valhalla in 2014 and missed the cut, but he's a four-time PGA Championship winner and was also a runner-up in this event on three other occasions. The model just locked in its Tiger Woods PGA Championship picks here..\n\nHow to make 2024 PGA Championship picks\n\nThe model is also targeting three other golfers with odds longer than 20-1 to make a strong run at the title. Anyone who backs these longshots could hit it big. You can only see the model's picks here.\n\nWho will win the 2024 PGA Championship, and which longshots will stun the golfing world?

He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nCaptain Brooks Koepka, of Smash GC, hit from the 10th tee during the final round of LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Sentosa, Singapore.

And to top it off, he challenged criticism that no one was tuning in to watch.\n\n\"What\u00b4s the definition of tuning in?\" he asked Bloomberg. \"To an 18-year-old, to a 25-year-old, tuning in may be 12 seconds on the phone. 'Let me see this, then we\u00b4ll go back and do that, and then I\u00b4ll come back over here and do another 14 seconds on this.\u00b4\n\nCaptain Phil Mickelson, of HyFlyers GC, hits from the sixth tee during the pro-am before LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club, Thursday, May 2, 2024, in Sentosa, Singapore. (Charles Laberge/LIV Golf via AP)\n\n\"That to me is tuning in,\" he said. \"That to me is a market that\u00b4s enormously wealthy, right? And enormously influential in the direction where we\u00b4re going.\"\n\nAs for the majors, let Phil Mickelson take it from there. He saw an X post on Sunday that said LIV should make it a priority to get its players access to the majors.\n\nMickelson replied in a post that he later deleted: \"Maybe some LIV players won\u00b4t be missed. But what if NONE of the LIV players played? Would they be missed? What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year? At some point they will care and will have to answer to sponsors and television. FAAFO.\"\n\nThe abbreviation is slang for \"(Expletive) around and find out.\" The next day, Talor Gooch and David Puig were among LIV players to accept invitations to the PGA Championship.\n\nIt wasn\u00b4t all saucy.\n\nLIV announced that longtime Pepsi executive Adam Harter would be its new chief marketing officer. That follows appointments of a chief financial officer, two executive vice presidents and two other hires.\n\nIt certainly doesn\u00b4t sound as though LIV Golf is going anywhere.\n\nA deal announced six months ago is paying dividends for the LPGA Tour this week.\n\nESPN+ and the LPGA signed a two-year agreement for eight tournaments to be streamed live through the 2025 season. In a fortuitous turn of events, one of those tournaments is the Cognizant Founders Cup.\n\nAttention figures to be high as Nelly Korda tries to set the LPGA Tour record with six straight victories. Her victory in the Chevron Championship three weeks ago tied the mark shared by Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nGolf Channel typically provides LPGA coverage. But the PGA Tour has two tournaments (Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach), and the PGA Tour Champions has a major championship (Regions Tradition).\n\nThe Cognizant Cup originally was scheduled to be shown on tape delay (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weeknights, 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the weekend). Now it will be available on the NBC Sports App and Peacock.\n\nESPN+ will stream nearly 40 hours of featured group coverage, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekday rounds, then from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend. Amy Rogers is leading the all-female primary broadcast team.\n\nThe next signature event on the PGA Tour will be without the Masters champion and the runner-up. Scottie Scheffler never planned to play the Wells Fargo Championship because his wife is due to give birth to their first child. The surprise was Ludvig Aberg.\n\nThe rising star from Sweden announced Monday he was withdrawing, releasing limited details except to say he has a \"knee issue\" that requires rest.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctors, we think it\u00b4s best that I take some additional time to rest,\" Aberg said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to playing in the PGA Championship at Valhalla next week.\n\nHe is not being replaced at Quail Hollow because Peter Malnati would be next in line among the top 10 available in the FedEx Cup, and Malnati already is eligible as a PGA Tour winner this year. That leaves a 69-man field - meaning someone will go off as a single - for the third consecutive signature event.\n\nSan Francisco\u00b4s four-man team for the tech-driven TGL league has a basketball background for a golf squad from all over the world.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry\u00b4s Avenue Sports Fund owns The Bay Golf Club, along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, two current and one retired Golden State Warriors players.\n\nThe roster features Ludvig Aberg of Sweden, Shane Lowry of Ireland, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Wyndham Clark of Denver.\n\nAll the matches will be played in Florida at an indoor arena that will be ready for the January launch at SoFi Center. The indoor league, to be broadcast in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+, was delayed a year when an inflatable roof collapsed.\n\n\"We believe that The Bay Golf Club will be a beloved team in Northern California and beyond,\" Lasry said.\n\nTGL is the creation of TMRW Sports launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nWebb Simpson is playing his eighth tournament of the year at the Wells Fargo Championship, four of them by getting a sponsor exemption to the $20 million signature events.\n\nIt\u00b4s easy to suggest it\u00b4s a perk from serving on the PGA Tour board. Simpson got an exemption to the Arnold Palmer Invitational (he\u00b4s a former Palmer/Buddy Worsham scholarship recipient at Wake Forest), RBC Heritage (past champion from 2020) and the Wells Fargo Championship (he\u00b4s a member at Quail Hollow).\n\nThe suspect exemption was from the AT&T Pebble Beach, especially when Gary Woodland did not get one as he recovers from brain surgery and won his U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.\n\nBut there\u00b4s no doubting the potential benefit, even without finishing better than 30th.\n\nSimpson has made the cut in three regular tournaments, earning $63,606 (19 FedEx Cup points). In the three signature events with small fields, he has made $270,125 (74 FedEx Cup points).\n\nHe is No. 151 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old amateur from Arizona, makes her LPGA debut this week in the Cognizant Founders Cup. She won the John Shippen Cognizant Cup on Monday at Upper Montclair to earn a spot in the field. The John Shippen series was created to provide playing opportunities on the LPGA and PGA Tour for top Black golfers. ... The most recent stretch of the Aon Swing Five for signature events was heavily weighted toward the last tournament. So it's no surprise that the top three players from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson - Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren - moved into the top five on the list and earned a spot in the Wells Fargo Championship. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer, who lost in a playoff at the team event in New Orleans, got bumped out. ... The Women's Scottish Open returns to Dundonald Links, about 20 minutes from Royal Troon, for the third straight year on Aug. 15-18. ... Aaron Rai closed with a 64 in the Byron Nelson, which moved him to No. 69 in the PGA Championship Points list and assured his spot at Valhalla.\n\nTaylor Pendrith became the fifth player this year to be outside the top 100 in the world ranking when he won a PGA Tour event with full FedEx Cup points.\n\n\"The pure enjoyment that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it. The stress that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it.\" - Jason Day, a former world No. 1 and father of five.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nCaptain Brooks Koepka, of Smash GC, reacts to his putt on the fourth green during the final round of LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club on Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Sentosa, Singapore.

Or the following year?\"\n\nMickelson and LIV's chief executive officer and commissioner Greg Norman made the same promise following the 2022 and 2023 seasons. It didn't go so well two years ago, but the league made up for that last offseason by signing Rahm and Hatton.\n\nWith seven events down and seven remaining in LIV's third season - next up Houston June 7-9 - some observations on the league that has its headquarters in West Palm Beach:\n\nBrooks Koepka's win last weekend at Singapore makes him the first LIV golfer with four career titles on that circuit. But the number he really cares about is five, as in his number of major championships.\n\nThe Jupiter, Florida, resident will chase his sixth major at Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, the site of the 2024 PGA Championship. Three of his major wins are the PGA Championship, including last year at Oak Hill outside of Rochester, New York.\n\nBrooks Koepka celebrates on the podium after winning the 2024 LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club. (Photo: Lionel Ng/Getty Images)\n\n\"Everything was really solid,\" Koepka said following his win at Singapore. \"I didn't really think I made too many mistakes. It's a great feeling when it kind of feels easy, if you get what I'm saying.\n\n\"I like the way things are trending.\"\n\nJoaquin Niemann is carrying his strong offseason that got him invites to the Masters and PGA Championship into the LIV season.\n\nNiemann leads the individual standings with 134.4 points. Rahm is second at 98.17. Niemann has two wins and has been in the top 10 in all but one event.\n\nCrushers, with captain Bryson DeChambeau, Anirban Lahiri, Paul Casey and Charles Howell III, lead the team standings.\n\nNiemann also leads the money list thanks to those two titles that earned him $4 million each. With $10,888,000 in prize money, he leads Dean Burmester ($7,258,013) and Koepka ($6,080,500).\n\nNiemann has earned $19.2 million in less than two years on LIV (he joined in August 2022). He made $15.1 million in prize money in 122 events on the PGA Tour dating back to his first event in 2017.\n\nRahm boosted LIV's profile after leaving the PGA Tour in December. He is off to a strong start in his new league with top-10 finishes in all seven events, including twice tying for third.\n\nAnd while Rahm has never mentioned regretting the decision that will net him a reported $550 million over three years including bonuses - plus prize money of which he already has topped $5 million this season - he did admit to being \"emotional\" when thinking about what he has given up.\n\nRahm said driving by TPC Scottsdale in his hometown, and knowing he is ineligible for events like the WM Phoenix Open and those in Palm Springs and at Torrey Pines in California is difficult.\n\nThen he thinks about a half billion dollars and all that goes away.\n\nAlthough results are the least important part of Anthony Kim joining LIV and getting his life back in order, it can't be ignored that the one-time world No. 6 continues to struggle on the course.\n\nKim has played five events as a wild card and has not finished better than 50th in the 54-man fields, placing 52nd, 54th, 53rd, 50th and 52nd. Still, his combined 52-over par has earned him $260,000.\n\n\"As important as golf is, I just want to be in the right mental place,\" Kim said at the LIV event at Doral. \"I would get upset if I played a bad round of golf for two weeks, and it would bother me, eat at me.\n\n\"(Now) I could care less what I shot. I know that the next day, I'm going to lace up any shoes or not lace up my shoes and go try my best again.\"\n\nTalor Gooch enjoyed playing the martyr this season for being left out of the majors. But LIV's 2023 individual champion finally got his wish.\n\nGooch announced on social media Monday he will be headed to Valhalla next week, thanking the PGA of America for the invite. The PGA of America confirmed that invite on Tuesday, along with six more LIV golfers.\n\nLIV now has 16 golfers in the PGA Championship, three more than in the recent Masters. Next up is the U.S. Open in June at Pinehurst. Of LIV's 46 non-exempt players for the U.S. Open, 35 are scheduled to compete in qualifying including Niemann, Sergio Garcia, Patrick Reed and Harold Varner III.\n\nGooch said he was not joining them. Perhaps he knows that may not be necessary.\n\nLee Westwood, 51, is the poster child for the fading star who decided to cash in one last time by joining LIV. A former world No. 1, Westwood was one of LIV's original golfers. He did so midway through a season (2021-22) in which he had one top-25 finish in 10 events.\n\nWestwood is one of just three LIV golfers who have yet to earn a point this season, along with Kim and Hudson Swafford. His best finish is T-32 in LIV's season opener at Mayakoba. Only the top 24 finishers in each event earn points. If it weren't for Westwood being a team captain he would be in danger of facing relegation.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors":

He doesn't need a lot of words", "body": "Brooks Koepka leaves the bluster to everyone else at LIV Golf. He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done.

He doesn't need a lot of words", "body": "Brooks Koepka leaves the bluster to everyone else at LIV Golf. He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nIndividual champion captain Brooks Koepka, of Smash GC, poses with the trophy after the final round of LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Sentosa, Singapore. (Jon Ferrey/LIV Golf via AP)\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) - in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead - Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning - in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I\u00b4ve been in this position before, I\u00b4ve capitalized. He\u00b4s only won one. I\u00b4m playing good. I don\u00b4t know, we\u00b4ll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out - three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can\u00b4t go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times - the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nCaptain Brooks Koepka, of Smash GC, hit from the 10th tee during the final round of LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club, Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Sentosa, Singapore.

He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how his game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully, something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back-to-back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Doug Ferguson",

Championship glory as Koepka defends Wanamaker Trophy", "body": "The second golf major of the summer is coming up with the 2024 PGA Championship taking centre-stage at the famous Valhalla Golf Club.\n\nThe PGA Championship is regarded as having the strongest field in golf as it invites twenty PGA club or teaching professionals rather than amateurs like the other majors.\n\nBrooks Koepka is the defending champion this year following his brilliant two-shot win at Oak Hill last May.\n\nKoepka claimed his fifth major title after seeing off challenges from Viktor Hovland and Scottie Scheffler during a dominant week in New York.\n\nBut world No.1 Scheffler is the favourite heading to Kentucky after his stunning victory at The Masters last month.\n\nBut could a key change in Scheffler's personal life open the door to his PGA Tour and LIV Golf rivals?\n\nScheffler is by far the best golfer on the planet.\n\nAs well as his imperious win at Augusta, he has also won at two more prestigious events this year with victories at The Players and the RBC Heritage.\n\nBut the 27-year-old has not played since that win at Hilton Head due to the fact his wife Meredith is about to give birth to their first child.\n\nScheffler has repeatedly said that he will not miss that important life event for anything and has elected to miss the Wells Fargo Championship this week.\n\nMeredith will give birth any day now - if she hasn't already - meaning Scheffler should have time to refocus on his golf.\n\nBut should the little one make him wait longer than expected, he may well miss out at Valhalla.\n\nMcIlroy finished 16 shots behind Scheffler at The Masters last month as another major passed him by.\n\nInfamously, McIlroy has been stuck on four major titles since August 2014, having 20 top ten finishes since.\n\nBut his last victory on the biggest stage actually came at the 2014 PGA Championship and at Valhalla!\n\nMcIlroy will hope his course knowledge and good experiences in Louisville can finally help end his major drought.\n\nThe 35-year-old is also heading to the tournament having turned a corner in terms of form following a morale-boosting win alongside friend Shane Lowry at the Zurich Classic.\n\nMcIlroy is looking for his 40th career win and it would be fitting if he could bring up such a milestone back at Valhalla.\n\nRahm has not tasted victory since his Masters win in 2023.\n\nHe claimed second at The Open last summer but is yet to take a victory on the LIV Golf tour and finished a lowly T45 at Augusta last month.\n\nMany will say his defection to the breakaway tour has hampered his game and the stats would back that up.\n\nBut the Spaniard was superb at the Ryder Cup and still has the perfect game for tough tournaments like the PGA Championship.\n\nRahm, the 2021 US Open champion, will be eager to hit back at his critics and prove he is still a major-calibre player in Kentucky.\n\nStill just 24 years old, Aberg has rocketed up the rankings over the past two years.\n\nHe made his major debut at the Masters last month, finishing a brilliant solo second behind Scheffler and even had more than a sniff of winning it.\n\nThe Swede is a generational talent with the long-game power, short-game nous and level-headed temperament needed to excel at the top of the game.\n\nHis last trophy came at the RSM Classic in November and he'll be itching to return to the winner's circle.\n\nMany will be backing him to go one step further than he did at The Masters and win on his PGA Championship debut.\n\nKoepka is undoubtedly the best golfer outside of the PGA Tour right now.\n\nHe won his fourth LIV Golf event in Singapore recently and has already proven that LIV players are good enough to claim major glory.\n\nKoepka's win at Oak Hill last May was historic.\n\nHe joined Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three PGA titles and became the 20th player to win five majors.\n\nA sixth major title would see him equal the hauls of legends Lee Trevino, Nick Faldo and Phil Mickelson and further boost his claim as a modern-day great.\n\nHe had an underwhelming Masters but loves playing at tough, long American courses and will no doubt be in the mix again come Sunday at Valhalla.", "source": {"uri": "talksport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "talkSPORT"}, "authors":

And to top it off, he challenged criticism that no one was tuning in to watch.\n\n\"What's the definition of tuning in?\" he asked Bloomberg. \"To an 18-year-old, to a 25-year-old, tuning in may be 12 seconds on the phone. 'Let me see this, then we'll go back and do that, and then I'll come back over here and do another 14 seconds on this.'\n\n\"That to me is tuning in,\" he said. \"That to me is a market that's enormously wealthy, right? And enormously influential in the direction where we're going.\"\n\nAs for the majors, let Phil Mickelson take it from there. He saw an X post on Sunday that said LIV should make it a priority to get its players access to the majors.\n\nMickelson replied in a post that he later deleted: \"Maybe some LIV players won't be missed. But what if NONE of the LIV players played? Would they be missed? What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year? At some point they will care and will have to answer to sponsors and television. FAAFO.\"\n\nThe abbreviation is slang for \"(Expletive) around and find out.\" The next day, Talor Gooch and David Puig were among LIV players to accept invitations to the PGA Championship.\n\nIt wasn't all saucy.\n\nLIV announced that longtime Pepsi executive Adam Harter would be its new chief marketing officer. That follows appointments of a chief financial officer, two executive vice presidents and two other hires.\n\nIt certainly doesn't sound as though LIV Golf is going anywhere.\n\nGOOD TIMING FOR LPGA\n\nA deal announced six months ago is paying dividends for the LPGA Tour this week.\n\nESPN+ and the LPGA signed a two-year agreement for eight tournaments to be streamed live through the 2025 season. In a fortuitous turn of events, one of those tournaments is the Cognizant Founders Cup.\n\nAttention figures to be high as Nelly Korda tries to set the LPGA Tour record with six straight victories. Her victory in the Chevron Championship three weeks ago tied the mark shared by Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nGolf Channel typically provides LPGA coverage. But the PGA Tour has two tournaments (Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach), and the PGA Tour Champions has a major championship (Regions Tradition).\n\nThe Cognizant Cup originally was scheduled to be shown on tape delay (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weeknights, 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the weekend). Now it will be available on the NBC Sports App and Peacock.\n\nESPN+ will stream nearly 40 hours of featured group coverage, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekday rounds, then from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend. Amy Rogers is leading the all-female primary broadcast team.\n\nABERG OUT\n\nThe next signature event on the PGA Tour will be without the Masters champion and the runner-up. Scottie Scheffler never planned to play the Wells Fargo Championship because his wife is due to give birth to their first child. The surprise was Ludvig Aberg.\n\nThe rising star from Sweden announced Monday he was withdrawing, releasing limited details except to say he has a \"knee issue\" that requires rest.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctors, we think it's best that I take some additional time to rest,\" Aberg said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to playing in the PGA Championship at Valhalla next week.\n\nHe is not being replaced at Quail Hollow because Peter Malnati would be next in line among the top 10 available in the FedEx Cup, and Malnati already is eligible as a PGA Tour winner this year. That leaves a 69-man field -- meaning someone will go off as a single -- for the third consecutive signature event.\n\nTGL BY THE BAY\n\nSan Francisco's four-man team for the tech-driven TGL league has a basketball background for a golf squad from all over the world.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry's Avenue Sports Fund owns The Bay Golf Club, along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, two current and one retired Golden State Warriors players.\n\nThe roster features Ludvig Aberg of Sweden, Shane Lowry of Ireland, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Wyndham Clark of Denver.\n\nAll the matches will be played in Florida at an indoor arena that will be ready for the January launch at SoFi Center. The indoor league, to be broadcast in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+, was delayed a year when an inflatable roof collapsed.\n\n\"We believe that The Bay Golf Club will be a beloved team in Northern California and beyond,\" Lasry said.\n\nTGL is the creation of TMRW Sports launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nSIMPSON BENEFITS\n\nWebb Simpson is playing his eighth tournament of the year at the Wells Fargo Championship, four of them by getting a sponsor exemption to the $20 million signature events.\n\nIt's easy to suggest it's a perk from serving on the PGA Tour board. Simpson got an exemption to the Arnold Palmer Invitational (he's a former Palmer/Buddy Worsham scholarship recipient at Wake Forest), RBC Heritage (past champion from 2020) and the Wells Fargo Championship (he's a member at Quail Hollow).\n\nThe suspect exemption was from the AT&T Pebble Beach, especially when Gary Woodland did not get one as he recovers from brain surgery and won his U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.\n\nBut there's no doubting the potential benefit, even without finishing better than 30th.\n\nSimpson has made the cut in three regular tournaments, earning $63,606 (19 FedEx Cup points). In the three signature events with small fields, he has made $270,125 (74 FedEx Cup points).\n\nHe is No. 151 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old amateur from Arizona, makes her LPGA debut this week in the Cognizant Founders Cup. She won the John Shippen Cognizant Cup on Monday at Upper Montclair to earn a spot in the field. The John Shippen series was created to provide playing opportunities on the LPGA and PGA Tour for top Black golfers. ... The most recent stretch of the Aon Swing Five for signature events was heavily weighted toward the last tournament. So it's no surprise that the top three players from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson -- Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren -- moved into the top five on the list and earned a spot in the Wells Fargo Championship. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer, who lost in a playoff at the team event in New Orleans, got bumped out. ... The Women's Scottish Open returns to Dundonald Links, about 20 minutes from Royal Troon, for the third straight year on Aug. 15-18. ... Aaron Rai closed with a 64 in the Byron Nelson, which moved him to No. 69 in the PGA Championship Points list and assured his spot at Valhalla.\n\nSTAT OF THE WEEK\n\nTaylor Pendrith became the fifth player this year to be outside the top 100 in the world ranking when he won a PGA Tour event with full FedEx Cup points.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\"The pure enjoyment that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it. The stress that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it.\" -- Jason Day, a former world No. 1 and father of five.\n\n___\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri":

Or the following year?\"\n\nMickelson and LIV's chief executive officer and commissioner Greg Norman made the same promise following the 2022 and 2023 seasons. It didn't go so well two years ago, but the league made up for that last offseason by signing Rahm and Hatton.\n\nWith seven events down and seven remaining in LIV's third season - next up Houston June 7-9 - some observations on the league that has its headquarters in West Palm Beach:\n\nKoepka ramping up for another major\n\nBrooks Koepka's win last weekend at Singapore makes him the first LIV golfer with four career titles on that circuit. But the number he really cares about is five, as in his number of major championships.\n\nThe Jupiter, Florida, resident will chase his sixth major at Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, the site of the 2024 PGA Championship. Three of his major wins are the PGA Championship, including last year at Oak Hill outside of Rochester, New York.\n\nBrooks Koepka celebrates on the podium after winning the 2024 LIV Golf Singapore at Sentosa Golf Club. (Photo: Lionel Ng/Getty Images)\n\n\"Everything was really solid,\" Koepka said following his win at Singapore. \"I didn't really think I made too many mistakes. It's a great feeling when it kind of feels easy, if you get what I'm saying.\n\n\"I like the way things are trending.\"\n\nNiemann leads points race\n\nJoaquin Niemann is carrying his strong offseason that got him invites to the Masters and PGA Championship into the LIV season.\n\nNiemann leads the individual standings with 134.4 points. Rahm is second at 98.17. Niemann has two wins and has been in the top 10 in all but one event.\n\nCrushers, with captain Bryson DeChambeau, Anirban Lahiri, Paul Casey and Charles Howell III, lead the team standings.\n\nMoney, money, money, money\n\nNiemann also leads the money list thanks to those two titles that earned him $4 million each. With $10,888,000 in prize money, he leads Dean Burmester ($7,258,013) and Koepka ($6,080,500).\n\nNiemann has earned $19.2 million in less than two years on LIV (he joined in August 2022). He made $15.1 million in prize money in 122 events on the PGA Tour dating back to his first event in 2017.\n\nAt times, Rahm misses PGA Tour\n\nRahm boosted LIV's profile after leaving the PGA Tour in December. He is off to a strong start in his new league with top-10 finishes in all seven events, including twice tying for third.\n\nAnd while Rahm has never mentioned regretting the decision that will net him a reported $550 million over three years including bonuses - plus prize money of which he already has topped $5 million this season - he did admit to being \"emotional\" when thinking about what he has given up.\n\nRahm said driving by TPC Scottsdale in his hometown, and knowing he is ineligible for events like the WM Phoenix Open and those in Palm Springs and at Torrey Pines in California is difficult.\n\nThen he thinks about a half billion dollars and all that goes away.\n\nAnthony Kim return not going well on course\n\nAlthough results are the least important part of Anthony Kim joining LIV and getting his life back in order, it can't be ignored that the one-time world No. 6 continues to struggle on the course.\n\nKim has played five events as a wild card and has not finished better than 50th in the 54-man fields, placing 52nd, 54th, 53rd, 50th and 52nd. Still, his combined 52-over par has earned him $260,000.\n\n\"As important as golf is, I just want to be in the right mental place,\" Kim said at the LIV event at Doral. \"I would get upset if I played a bad round of golf for two weeks, and it would bother me, eat at me.\n\n\"(Now) I could care less what I shot. I know that the next day, I'm going to lace up any shoes or not lace up my shoes and go try my best again.\"\n\nGooch gets his wish\n\nTalor Gooch enjoyed playing the martyr this season for being left out of the majors. But LIV's 2023 individual champion finally got his wish.\n\nGooch announced on social media Monday he will be headed to Valhalla next week, thanking the PGA of America for the invite. The PGA of America confirmed that invite on Tuesday, along with six more LIV golfers.\n\nLIV now has 16 golfers in the PGA Championship, three more than in the recent Masters. Next up is the U.S. Open in June at Pinehurst. Of LIV's 46 non-exempt players for the U.S. Open, 35 are scheduled to compete in qualifying including Niemann, Sergio Garcia, Patrick Reed and Harold Varner III.\n\nGooch said he was not joining them. Perhaps he knows that may not be necessary.\n\nWestwood fading fast\n\nLee Westwood, 51, is the poster child for the fading star who decided to cash in one last time by joining LIV. A former world No. 1, Westwood was one of LIV's original golfers. He did so midway through a season (2021-22) in which he had one top-25 finish in 10 events.\n\nWestwood is one of just three LIV golfers who have yet to earn a point this season, along with Kim and Hudson Swafford. His best finish is T-32 in LIV's season opener at Mayakoba. Only the top 24 finishers in each event earn points. If it weren't for Westwood being a team captain he would be in danger of facing relegation.", "source": {"uri": "golfweek.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golfweek"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "napavalleyregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Napa Valley Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_j_phillip@napavalleyregister.com", "name": "David J.

He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nToday's Top Headlines 1 man dead after shooting on Aiken's Southside Dougherty Road resurfacing project could cause traffic delays on Aiken's Southside Jackson resident finds purpose, fulfillment as foster parent Rolls-Royce adding capacity at Graniteville plant to meet data center backup power demands Business roundup: New Japanese restaurant opens, La Parisienne has new co-owner 2 men arrested in connection with shooting near Hitchcock Animal Hospital Today's events for May 7 Strom Thurmond baseball walks off against Ninety Six to win district title Local Results for May 7 Super fun: Kentucky Derby parties provide boost for charities\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36- and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf",

He is at No. 92, and the invitation keeps alive his streak of playing every major since the 2014 Masters.\n\nThe PGA Championship returns to Valhalla in Louisville, Kentucky, for the fourth time on May 16-19. Rory McIlroy won at Valhalla the last time it was there in 2014. The course is best known for Woods winning a playoff over Bob May in 2000 for his third straight major.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The surprise was Talor Gooch announcing in an X post on Monday that he had received an invitation.\n\nIt was a sign the PGA of America's selection committee was looking at LIV results on their own, as Gooch doesn't play much outside the Saudi league. He won three times on LIV in 2023 and won the season points list.\n\nOther invitations went to Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk, all of them inside the top 100 in the world. The seventh invitation went to David Puig, the 22-year-old from Spain who is No. 106 in the world ranking. Puig has finished in the top 10 in six of his last seven tournaments on the Asian Tour, including two wins.\n\nLIV will be represented by 16 players, down from 18 a year ago.\n\nThere might have been one more, except British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen turned down his invitation. Oosthuizen, who is No. 125 in the world, won twice late last year in South Africa in tournaments co-sanctioned by the European tour.\n\nHis manager, Carlos Rodriguez, said in a text message that Oosthuizen already had some personal commitments.\n\nThe LIV group includes defending champion Brooks Koepka, who goes for a fourth PGA Championship title. He is the only active LIV player to win a major.\n\nKerry Haigh, the championship director for the PGA of America, has said he would consider deserving players from tours around the world. Invitations were given to Tim Widing of Sweden, who has won consecutive tournaments on the Korn Ferry Tour.\n\nAnother invitation went to Kazuma Kobori, a 22-year-old born in Japan who now plays under the New Zealand flag. He has won three times this year in the Webex Players Series on the PGA Tour of Australasia.\n\nThe field has 21 club professionals -- 20 from the PGA Professional Championship last week, and Michael Block, who qualified by finishing among the top 15 last year at Oak Hill.\n\nThe PGA is keeping two spots open in case the winners of the Wells Fargo Championship and the Myrtle Beach Classic are not already eligible. Only four players in the 69-man field at the Wells Fargo Championship have not qualified. The first alternate is Doug Ghim.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this

That follows appointments of a chief financial officer, two executive vice presidents and two other hires.\n\nIt certainly doesn't sound as though LIV Golf is going anywhere.\n\nGOOD TIMING FOR LPGA\n\nA deal announced six months ago is paying dividends for the LPGA Tour this week.\n\nESPN+ and the LPGA signed a two-year agreement for eight tournaments to be streamed live through the 2025 season. In a fortuitous turn of events, one of those tournaments is the Cognizant Founders Cup.\n\nAttention figures to be high as Nelly Korda tries to set the LPGA Tour record with six straight victories. Her victory in the Chevron Championship three weeks ago tied the mark shared by Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nGolf Channel typically provides LPGA coverage. But the PGA Tour has two tournaments (Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach), and the PGA Tour Champions has a major championship (Regions Tradition).\n\nThe Cognizant Cup originally was scheduled to be shown on tape delay (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weeknights, 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the weekend). Now it will be available on the NBC Sports App and Peacock.\n\nESPN+ will stream nearly 40 hours of featured group coverage, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekday rounds, then from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend. Amy Rogers is leading the all-female primary broadcast team.\n\nABERG OUT\n\nThe next signature event on the PGA Tour will be without the Masters champion and the runner-up. Scottie Scheffler never planned to play the Wells Fargo Championship because his wife is due to give birth to their first child. The surprise was Ludvig Aberg.\n\nThe rising star from Sweden announced Monday he was withdrawing, releasing limited details except to say he has a \"knee issue\" that requires rest.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctors, we think it's best that I take some additional time to rest,\" Aberg said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to playing in the PGA Championship at Valhalla next week.\n\nHe is not being replaced at Quail Hollow because Peter Malnati would be next in line among the top 10 available in the FedEx Cup, and Malnati already is eligible as a PGA Tour winner this year. That leaves a 69-man field -- meaning someone will go off as a single -- for the third consecutive signature event.\n\nTGL BY THE BAY\n\nSan Francisco's four-man team for the tech-driven TGL league has a basketball background for a golf squad from all over the world.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry's Avenue Sports Fund owns The Bay Golf Club, along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, two current and one retired Golden State Warriors players.\n\nThe roster features Ludvig Aberg of Sweden, Shane Lowry of Ireland, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Wyndham Clark of Denver.\n\nAll the matches will be played in Florida at an indoor arena that will be ready for the January launch at SoFi Center. The indoor league, to be broadcast in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+, was delayed a year when an inflatable roof collapsed.\n\n\"We believe that The Bay Golf Club will be a beloved team in Northern California and beyond,\" Lasry said.\n\nTGL is the creation of TMRW Sports launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nSIMPSON BENEFITS\n\nWebb Simpson is playing his eighth tournament of the year at the Wells Fargo Championship, four of them by getting a sponsor exemption to the $20 million signature events.\n\nIt's easy to suggest it's a perk from serving on the PGA Tour board. Simpson got an exemption to the Arnold Palmer Invitational (he's a former Palmer/Buddy Worsham scholarship recipient at Wake Forest), RBC Heritage (past champion from 2020) and the Wells Fargo Championship (he's a member at Quail Hollow).\n\nThe suspect exemption was from the AT&T Pebble Beach, especially when Gary Woodland did not get one as he recovers from brain surgery and won his U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.\n\nBut there's no doubting the potential benefit, even without finishing better than 30th.\n\nSimpson has made the cut in three regular tournaments, earning $63,606 (19 FedEx Cup points). In the three signature events with small fields, he has made $270,125 (74 FedEx Cup points).\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old amateur from Arizona, makes her LPGA debut this week in the Cognizant Founders Cup. She won the John Shippen Cognizant Cup on Monday at Upper Montclair to earn a spot in the field. The John Shippen series was created to provide playing opportunities on the LPGA and PGA Tour for top Black golfers. ... The most recent stretch of the Aon Swing Five for signature events was heavily weighted toward the last tournament. So it's no surprise that the top three players from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson -- Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren -- moved into the top five on the list and earned a spot in the Wells Fargo Championship. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer, who lost in a playoff at the team event in New Orleans, got bumped out. ... The Women's Scottish Open returns to Dundonald Links, about 20 minutes from Royal Troon, for the third straight year on Aug. 15-18. ... Aaron Rai closed with a 64 in the Byron Nelson, which moved him to No. 69 in the PGA Championship Points list and assured his spot at Valhalla.\n\nSTAT OF THE WEEK\n\nTaylor Pendrith became the fifth player this year to be outside the top 100 in the world ranking when he won a PGA Tour event with full FedEx Cup points.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\"The pure enjoyment that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it.

But the PGA Tour has two tournaments (Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach), and the PGA Tour Champions has a major championship (Regions Tradition).\n\nThe Cognizant Cup originally was scheduled to be shown on tape delay (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weeknights, 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the weekend). Now it will be available on the NBC Sports App and Peacock.\n\nESPN+ will stream nearly 40 hours of featured group coverage, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekday rounds, then from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend. Amy Rogers is leading the all-female primary broadcast team.\n\nABERG OUT\n\nThe next signature event on the PGA Tour will be without the Masters champion and the runner-up. Scottie Scheffler never planned to play the Wells Fargo Championship because his wife is due to give birth to their first child. The surprise was Ludvig Aberg.\n\nThe rising star from Sweden announced Monday he was withdrawing, releasing limited details except to say he has a \"knee issue\" that requires rest.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctors, we think it's best that I take some additional time to rest,\" Aberg said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to playing in the PGA Championship at Valhalla next week.\n\nHe is not being replaced at Quail Hollow because Peter Malnati would be next in line among the top 10 available in the FedEx Cup, and Malnati already is eligible as a PGA Tour winner this year. That leaves a 69-man field -- meaning someone will go off as a single -- for the third consecutive signature event.\n\nTGL BY THE BAY\n\nSan Francisco's four-man team for the tech-driven TGL league has a basketball background for a golf squad from all over the world.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry's Avenue Sports Fund owns The Bay Golf Club, along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, two current and one retired Golden State Warriors players.\n\nThe roster features Ludvig Aberg of Sweden, Shane Lowry of Ireland, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Wyndham Clark of Denver.\n\nAll the matches will be played in Florida at an indoor arena that will be ready for the January launch at SoFi Center. The indoor league, to be broadcast in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+, was delayed a year when an inflatable roof collapsed.\n\n\"We believe that The Bay Golf Club will be a beloved team in Northern California and beyond,\" Lasry said.\n\nTGL is the creation of TMRW Sports launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nSIMPSON BENEFITS\n\nWebb Simpson is playing his eighth tournament of the year at the Wells Fargo Championship, four of them by getting a sponsor exemption to the $20 million signature events.\n\nIt's easy to suggest it's a perk from serving on the PGA Tour board. Simpson got an exemption to the Arnold Palmer Invitational (he's a former Palmer/Buddy Worsham scholarship recipient at Wake Forest), RBC Heritage (past champion from 2020) and the Wells Fargo Championship (he's a member at Quail Hollow).\n\nThe suspect exemption was from the AT&T Pebble Beach, especially when Gary Woodland did not get one as he recovers from brain surgery and won his U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.\n\nBut there's no doubting the potential benefit, even without finishing better than 30th.\n\nSimpson has made the cut in three regular tournaments, earning $63,606 (19 FedEx Cup points). In the three signature events with small fields, he has made $270,125 (74 FedEx Cup points).\n\nHe is No. 151 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nDIVOTS\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old amateur from Arizona, makes her LPGA debut this week in the Cognizant Founders Cup. She won the John Shippen Cognizant Cup on Monday at Upper Montclair to earn a spot in the field. The John Shippen series was created to provide playing opportunities on the LPGA and PGA Tour for top Black golfers. ... The most recent stretch of the Aon Swing Five for signature events was heavily weighted toward the last tournament. So it's no surprise that the top three players from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson -- Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren -- moved into the top five on the list and earned a spot in the Wells Fargo Championship. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer, who lost in a playoff at the team event in New Orleans, got bumped out. ... The Women's Scottish Open returns to Dundonald Links, about 20 minutes from Royal Troon, for the third straight year on Aug. 15-18. ... Aaron Rai closed with a 64 in the Byron Nelson, which moved him to No. 69 in the PGA Championship Points list and assured his spot at Valhalla.\n\nSTAT OF THE WEEK\n\nTaylor Pendrith became the fifth player this year to be outside the top 100 in the world ranking when he won a PGA Tour event with full FedEx Cup points.\n\nFINAL WORD\n\n\"The pure enjoyment that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it. The stress that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it.\" -- Jason Day, a former world No. 1 and father of five.\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com",

Koepka won the PGA Championship in 2018 and 2019 before finishing two strokes ahead of Scottie Scheffler and Viktor Hovland last year for the fifth major victory of his career. The two-time U.S. Open champion now has a chance to join Tiger Woods, who went back-to-back in the PGA Championship twice (1999-2000, 2006-07). Koepka will hope to redeem himself after finishing 45th at the Masters last month.\n\nKoepka is 12-1 and Scheffler, who won the Masters for the second time in three years, is the 3-1 favorite in the latest 2024 PGA Championship odds. Jon Rahm is 10-1 in the 2024 PGA Championship betting odds, while two-time winner Rory McIlroy and Ludvig Aberg also are among the top 2024 PGA Championship contenders at 12-1. Before making any 2024 PGA Championship picks or bets, you need to see the PGA Championship 2024 predictions and best bets from golf insider Patrick McDonald.\n\nMcDonald joined CBS Sports as a golf writer in 2022 after stops at NBC Sports and RyderCup.com. Covering the sport from a broader perspective, McDonald still likes to dip his toes into the betting pools on a weekly basis between the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and more. Featured weekly on the Early Wedge, he has given out numerous winners already in 2024, including Jake Knapp (50-1) at the Mexico Open. Anyone who has followed his lead is way up.\n\nNow, McDonald has focused his attention on the 2024 PGA Championship field and has locked in his best bets, top sleepers and favorites to avoid. You can only see them here.\n\nTop 2024 PGA Championship expert picks\n\nOne shocker from McDonald: The expert is fading Scottie Scheffler, who is priced too short to back in such a deep and talented 2024 PGA Championship field. The world No. 1 has won four of the 10 tournaments he's played this season, matching the career-high for victories he set in 2021-22. The four wins came in his last five outings, with the other result in that stretch being runner-up at the Houston Open. \"He's the rightful favorite, as he's the best player in the world by a very wide margin, but I can't get behind Scheffler at +300,\" McDonald told SportsLine. See who else to fade here.\n\nOn the other hand, McDonald loves the value on Xander Schauffele at 20-1. The 30-year-old remains in search of his first win of the season, and also the first in a major of his career. Schauffele has recorded seven top-10 finishes in 11 events this campaign, with his best result being runner-up to Scheffler at The Players. He has posted 12 top-10s in major tournaments and three over the last five, including an eighth-place at The Masters. \"He has been the second-best player in the world from a statistical sense and is as good of a sure thing when it comes to entering the weekend in contention,\" McDonald said. See who else to back here.\n\nHow to make 2024 PGA Championship golf picks\n\nMcDonald has locked in his best bets for the PGA Championship 2024 and also has selected a longshot who's priced well over 50-1. This golfer \"has made significant strides in his game\" this year. If this player can pull off a stunning victory, he would cash in huge for anyone who backs him.

And to top it off, he challenged criticism that no one was tuning in to watch.\n\n\"What's the definition of tuning in?\" he asked Bloomberg. \"To an 18-year-old, to a 25-year-old, tuning in may be 12 seconds on the phone. 'Let me see this, then we'll go back and do that, and then I'll come back over here and do another 14 seconds on this.'\n\n\"That to me is tuning in,\" he said. \"That to me is a market that's enormously wealthy, right? And enormously influential in the direction where we're going.\"\n\nAs for the majors, let Phil Mickelson take it from there. He saw an X post on Sunday that said LIV should make it a priority to get its players access to the majors.\n\nMickelson replied in a post that he later deleted: \"Maybe some LIV players won't be missed. But what if NONE of the LIV players played? Would they be missed? What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year? At some point they will care and will have to answer to sponsors and television. FAAFO.\"\n\nThe abbreviation is slang for \"(Expletive) around and find out.\" The next day, Talor Gooch and David Puig were among LIV players to accept invitations to the PGA Championship.\n\nIt wasn't all saucy.\n\nLIV announced that longtime Pepsi executive Adam Harter would be its new chief marketing officer. That follows appointments of a chief financial officer, two executive vice presidents and two other hires.\n\nIt certainly doesn't sound as though LIV Golf is going anywhere.\n\nA deal announced six months ago is paying dividends for the LPGA Tour this week.\n\nESPN+ and the LPGA signed a two-year agreement for eight tournaments to be streamed live through the 2025 season. In a fortuitous turn of events, one of those tournaments is the Cognizant Founders Cup.\n\nAttention figures to be high as Nelly Korda tries to set the LPGA Tour record with six straight victories. Her victory in the Chevron Championship three weeks ago tied the mark shared by Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nGolf Channel typically provides LPGA coverage. But the PGA Tour has two tournaments (Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach), and the PGA Tour Champions has a major championship (Regions Tradition).\n\nThe Cognizant Cup originally was scheduled to be shown on tape delay (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weeknights, 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the weekend). Now it will be available on the NBC Sports App and Peacock.\n\nESPN+ will stream nearly 40 hours of featured group coverage, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekday rounds, then from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend. Amy Rogers is leading the all-female primary broadcast team.\n\nThe next signature event on the PGA Tour will be without the Masters champion and the runner-up. Scottie Scheffler never planned to play the Wells Fargo Championship because his wife is due to give birth to their first child. The surprise was Ludvig Aberg.\n\nThe rising star from Sweden announced Monday he was withdrawing, releasing limited details except to say he has a \"knee issue\" that requires rest.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctors, we think it's best that I take some additional time to rest,\" Aberg said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to playing in the PGA Championship at Valhalla next week.\n\nHe is not being replaced at Quail Hollow because Peter Malnati would be next in line among the top 10 available in the FedEx Cup, and Malnati already is eligible as a PGA Tour winner this year. That leaves a 69-man field -- meaning someone will go off as a single -- for the third consecutive signature event.\n\nSan Francisco's four-man team for the tech-driven TGL league has a basketball background for a golf squad from all over the world.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry's Avenue Sports Fund owns The Bay Golf Club, along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, two current and one retired Golden State Warriors players.\n\nThe roster features Ludvig Aberg of Sweden, Shane Lowry of Ireland, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Wyndham Clark of Denver.\n\nAll the matches will be played in Florida at an indoor arena that will be ready for the January launch at SoFi Center. The indoor league, to be broadcast in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+, was delayed a year when an inflatable roof collapsed.\n\n\"We believe that The Bay Golf Club will be a beloved team in Northern California and beyond,\" Lasry said.\n\nTGL is the creation of TMRW Sports launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nWebb Simpson is playing his eighth tournament of the year at the Wells Fargo Championship, four of them by getting a sponsor exemption to the $20 million signature events.\n\nIt's easy to suggest it's a perk from serving on the PGA Tour board. Simpson got an exemption to the Arnold Palmer Invitational (he's a former Palmer/Buddy Worsham scholarship recipient at Wake Forest), RBC Heritage (past champion from 2020) and the Wells Fargo Championship (he's a member at Quail Hollow).\n\nThe suspect exemption was from the AT&T Pebble Beach, especially when Gary Woodland did not get one as he recovers from brain surgery and won his U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.\n\nBut there's no doubting the potential benefit, even without finishing better than 30th.\n\nSimpson has made the cut in three regular tournaments, earning $63,606 (19 FedEx Cup points). In the three signature events with small fields, he has made $270,125 (74 FedEx Cup points).\n\nHe is No. 151 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old amateur from Arizona, makes her LPGA debut this week in the Cognizant Founders Cup. She won the John Shippen Cognizant Cup on Monday at Upper Montclair to earn a spot in the field. The John Shippen series was created to provide playing opportunities on the LPGA and PGA Tour for top Black golfers. ... The most recent stretch of the Aon Swing Five for signature events was heavily weighted toward the last tournament. So it's no surprise that the top three players from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson -- Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren -- moved into the top five on the list and earned a spot in the Wells Fargo Championship. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer, who lost in a playoff at the team event in New Orleans, got bumped out. ... The Women's Scottish Open returns to Dundonald Links, about 20 minutes from Royal Troon, for the third straight year on Aug. 15-18. ... Aaron Rai closed with a 64 in the Byron Nelson, which moved him to No. 69 in the PGA Championship Points list and assured his spot at Valhalla.\n\nTaylor Pendrith became the fifth player this year to be outside the top 100 in the world ranking when he won a PGA Tour event with full FedEx Cup points.\n\n\"The pure enjoyment that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it. The stress that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it.\" -- Jason Day, a former world No. 1 and father of five.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news",

He already has one Major title this year after victory at The Masters.\n\nWith Scheffler's wife Meredith due to give birth imminently, there is a chance he will be a late withdrawal, but assuming he plays, the World No.1 will be hard to stop.\n\nAs ever, 15-time Major winner Tiger Woods will command much of the attention in his first appearance since finishing 60th at The Masters. Despite fading over the weekend at Augusta National, Woods remains fiercely competitive as he looks for a sixth PGA Championship title.\n\nRory McIlroy is still seeking a fifth Major title a decade after claiming his fourth. Will this finally be the week when he achieves it?\n\nAnother player hoping to make his own piece of history this week is Jordan Spieth, who is just one PGA Championship title short of a career Grand Slam.\n\nOther big names in the field include 2023 Masters champion Jon Rahm, Brian Harman, who won The Open last year, and US Open champion Wyndham Clark.\n\nAs well as Koepka and Rahm, other LIV golfers fancied to do well include 2022 Open champion Cameron Smith, former World No.1 Dustin Johnson and 2020 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau. It would also be hard to completely write off the chances of another LIV Golf star, 2021 PGA Champion Phil Mickelson, who is looking for a seventh Major title.\n\nJustin Thomas won his second PGA Championship title in 2022, and he will be hoping to get firmly on track after a frustrating spell of form over the last 12 months.\n\nOne of the game's rising stars, Ludvig Aberg, withdrew from last week's Wells Fargo Championship with a knee issue, but he's also in the field and will be looking to show the kind of form that saw him finish runner-up to Scheffler at The Masters.\n\nOther big names include two-time Major winner Collin Morikawa and Max Homa, who will both be encouraged after finishing T3 at The Masters.\n\nThe likes of Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele and Viktor Hovland, who are all in the world's top 10, play too.\n\nMuch of the attention will also be on club pro Michael Block, who created a sensation in 2023 with a finish of T15, comfortably ahead of stars of the calibre or Rahm and Spieth.\n\nBelow is the complete field for the 2024 PGA Championship at Valhalla.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"},

And to top it off, he challenged criticism that no one was tuning in to watch.\n\n\"What's the definition of tuning in?\" he asked Bloomberg. \"To an 18-year-old, to a 25-year-old, tuning in may be 12 seconds on the phone. 'Let me see this, then we'll go back and do that, and then I'll come back over here and do another 14 seconds on this.'\n\nPHOTOS: Greg Norman and Phil Mickelson make for an interesting week on LIV Golf\n\n\"That to me is tuning in,\" he said. \"That to me is a market that's enormously wealthy, right? And enormously influential in the direction where we're going.\"\n\nAs for the majors, let Phil Mickelson take it from there. He saw an X post on Sunday that said LIV should make it a priority to get its players access to the majors.\n\nMickelson replied in a post that he later deleted: \"Maybe some LIV players won't be missed. But what if NONE of the LIV players played? Would they be missed? What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year? At some point they will care and will have to answer to sponsors and television. FAAFO.\"\n\nThe abbreviation is slang for \"(Expletive) around and find out.\" The next day, Talor Gooch and David Puig were among LIV players to accept invitations to the PGA Championship.\n\nIt wasn't all saucy.\n\nLIV announced that longtime Pepsi executive Adam Harter would be its new chief marketing officer. That follows appointments of a chief financial officer, two executive vice presidents and two other hires.\n\nIt certainly doesn't sound as though LIV Golf is going anywhere.\n\nA deal announced six months ago is paying dividends for the LPGA Tour this week.\n\nESPN+ and the LPGA signed a two-year agreement for eight tournaments to be streamed live through the 2025 season. In a fortuitous turn of events, one of those tournaments is the Cognizant Founders Cup.\n\nAttention figures to be high as Nelly Korda tries to set the LPGA Tour record with six straight victories. Her victory in the Chevron Championship three weeks ago tied the mark shared by Nancy Lopez and Annika Sorenstam.\n\nGolf Channel typically provides LPGA coverage. But the PGA Tour has two tournaments (Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach), and the PGA Tour Champions has a major championship (Regions Tradition).\n\nThe Cognizant Cup originally was scheduled to be shown on tape delay (7 p.m. to 9 p.m. on weeknights, 8:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the weekend). Now it will be available on the NBC Sports App and Peacock.\n\nESPN+ will stream nearly 40 hours of featured group coverage, from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on the weekday rounds, then from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on the weekend. Amy Rogers is leading the all-female primary broadcast team.\n\nThe next signature event on the PGA Tour will be without the Masters champion and the runner-up. Scottie Scheffler never planned to play the Wells Fargo Championship because his wife is due to give birth to their first child. The surprise was Ludvig Aberg.\n\nThe rising star from Sweden announced Monday he was withdrawing, releasing limited details except to say he has a \"knee issue\" that requires rest.\n\n\"After consulting with my doctors, we think it's best that I take some additional time to rest,\" Aberg said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to playing in the PGA Championship at Valhalla next week.\n\nHe is not being replaced at Quail Hollow because Peter Malnati would be next in line among the top 10 available in the FedEx Cup, and Malnati already is eligible as a PGA Tour winner this year. That leaves a 69-man field - meaning someone will go off as a single - for the third consecutive signature event.\n\nSan Francisco's four-man team for the tech-driven TGL league has a basketball background for a golf squad from all over the world.\n\nFormer Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry's Avenue Sports Fund owns The Bay Golf Club, along with Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, two current and one retired Golden State Warriors players.\n\nThe roster features Ludvig Aberg of Sweden, Shane Lowry of Ireland, Min Woo Lee of Australia and Wyndham Clark of Denver.\n\nAll the matches will be played in Florida at an indoor arena that will be ready for the January launch at SoFi Center. The indoor league, to be broadcast in prime time on ESPN and ESPN+, was delayed a year when an inflatable roof collapsed.\n\n\"We believe that The Bay Golf Club will be a beloved team in Northern California and beyond,\" Lasry said.\n\nTGL is the creation of TMRW Sports launched by Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.\n\nWebb Simpson is playing his eighth tournament of the year at the Wells Fargo Championship, four of them by getting a sponsor exemption to the $20 million signature events.\n\nIt's easy to suggest it's a perk from serving on the PGA Tour board. Simpson got an exemption to the Arnold Palmer Invitational (he's a former Palmer/Buddy Worsham scholarship recipient at Wake Forest), RBC Heritage (past champion from 2020) and the Wells Fargo Championship (he's a member at Quail Hollow).\n\nThe suspect exemption was from the AT&T Pebble Beach, especially when Gary Woodland did not get one as he recovers from brain surgery and won his U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.\n\nBut there's no doubting the potential benefit, even without finishing better than 30th.\n\nSimpson has made the cut in three regular tournaments, earning $63,606 (19 FedEx Cup points). In the three signature events with small fields, he has made $270,125 (74 FedEx Cup points).\n\nHe is No. 151 in the FedEx Cup standings.\n\nAshley Shaw, a 15-year-old amateur from Arizona, makes her LPGA debut this week in the Cognizant Founders Cup. She won the John Shippen Cognizant Cup on Monday at Upper Montclair to earn a spot in the field. The John Shippen series was created to provide playing opportunities on the LPGA and PGA Tour for top Black golfers. ... The most recent stretch of the Aon Swing Five for signature events was heavily weighted toward the last tournament. So it's no surprise that the top three players from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson - Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren - moved into the top five on the list and earned a spot in the Wells Fargo Championship. Chad Ramey and Martin Trainer, who lost in a playoff at the team event in New Orleans, got bumped out. ... The Women's Scottish Open returns to Dundonald Links, about 20 minutes from Royal Troon, for the third straight year on Aug. 15-18. ... Aaron Rai closed with a 64 in the Byron Nelson, which moved him to No. 69 in the PGA Championship Points list and assured his spot at Valhalla.\n\nTaylor Pendrith became the fifth player this year to be outside the top 100 in the world ranking when he won a PGA Tour event with full FedEx Cup points.\n\n\"The pure enjoyment that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it. The stress that you get from having kids, there is nothing like it.\" - Jason Day, a former world No. 1 and father of five.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Nine, to be exact. Which made it high time for the PGA of America to finalize next week's PGA Championship field with special invites. And they mixed in a surprise or two.\n\nThe field of 156 was officially finalized Tuesday morning, with six LIV golfers receiving an invite. Most of those came as expected. The PGA of America typically invites any players ranked in the top 100 in the Official World Golf Ranking, which meant the likes of Adrian Meronk, Patrick Reed and Lucas Herbert weren't surprises to earn admission.\n\nLIV Golf tournaments do not receive OWGR points (at the moment) because the league has failed to establish its tournaments to fit various OWGR standards. But Meronk and Herbert both joined that tour this year, so they've held on to enough OWGR points from a year ago to qualify. Reed, on the other hand, has played a number of Asian Tour events, which offer points, and also fared pretty well in major championships, which dish out the most points. His 12th-place finish at the Masters last month pushed him back inside the top 100 in the world, ensuring he will compete in his 42nd straight major next week.\n\nOutside the top 100 OWGR is where the invites get most interesting. 22-year-old David Puig received an invite to Valhalla next week after playing as much golf this year as any of his LIV colleagues. Puig has already played in four Asian Tour events in 2024, in addition to a bunch toward the end of 2023. This year, he's finished in the top 10 in all of them, even winning the Malaysian open in February. He's ranked No. 106 right now by the OWGR and 103 by DataGolf, which measures players exclusively on their performance, regardless of tour.\n\nIn other words, Puig is right there on the edge of the top-level golf, and plenty worthy of an invite based on his worldwide finishes. Dean Burmester presents an even more fascinating case, as he ranks outside the top 100 OWGR but well inside that number via DataGolf. Burmester won multiple tournaments in his native South Africa at the tail end of 2023, and then won LIV Golf's pre-Masters event in Miami. As a result, DataGolf calls him the 38th-best player in the world right now. Yes, even higher than Brooks Koepka. The PGA of America deemed him a value add to its field and now he'll play in his eighth career major championship.\n\nThe final LIV golfer to accept a major championship invite may surprise you. It's Talor Gooch, world No. 644, and not Louis Oosthuizen, world No. 125.\n\nThe difference between those two rankings says everything about each player's approach to the golfing calendar. Gooch hasn't played an OWGR-sanctioned event since November. Meanwhile, Oosthuizen won multiple DP World Tour events in December, and nearly won an Asian Tour event in February. But in terms of LIV Golf bonafides, Gooch has Oosthuizen beat. By a lot. The former has won three LIV events while the latter has lifted zero individual trophies.\n\nIf you ask the folks at DataGolf, there's virtually no difference between the two. Gooch is ranked 35th while Oosthuizen is ranked 32nd. In the absence of any other explanation (like, say, Oosthuizen receiving an invitation and turning it down) it's likely the line for invites was drawn directly between these two gents. Good for Gooch, not so good for Oosty.\n\nIt remains possible, though unlikely, Oosthuizen could still earn an invite in the coming days. The PGA of America announced just 154 names of its 156-man field as it is holding two final spots for the winners of this week's two PGA Tour events. If a non-qualified player wins either event, they'll be added to the field at Valhalla. But in the event that, say, Rory McIlroy (already in the field) wins the Wells Fargo Championship, we could see a last-last-last minute invite go out to another player like Oosthuizen.\n\nAs for Gooch, it will be his last chance for major championship glory in 2024. He made it clear last week that he did not sign up for the qualifying series of the U.S. Open, nor the Open Championship. Winning the PGA Championship, though -- that would easily take care of those.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Meronk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Meronk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Herbert_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Herbert (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Puig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Puig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/reed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child. Rory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on

Since then, he has scooped three victories in four starts on the Challenger tier on the PGA Tour of Australasia, booked his spot at The Open Championship at Royal Troon, pocketed a DP World Tour card for 2024-25, and now extradited his first appearance at a Major.\n\nThe 22-year-old's story is similar to that of former PGA Tour of Australasia Order of Merit winner and DP World Tour pro, David Micheluzzi. Not only have both claimed the aforementioned prize, but the Australian also made his Major bow at last year's PGA Championship.\n\nKobori's triumph on the season-long points list ultimately earned him a spot at Valhalla Golf Club in Kentucky, though, with the PGA of Australia stating that the Canterbury golfer was informed of his invitation during the early hours of Tuesday morning.\n\nThe world No.432 will be joined by a number of LIV Golf League players after several names - including Talor Gooch and David Puig - were offered a late slot into the second men's Major of the year.\n\nTypically, all golfers inside the World's top-100 - according to the OWGR - are handed an invite into the PGA Championship. But due to the fact that LIV is unable to offer world-ranking points at its tournaments, many players such as Gooch and Joaquin Niemann have fallen much further down the list than their play truly reflects.\n\nHowever, due to the PGA of America operating independently to the three main circuits in men's golf, it can offer places at its Major to whoever it likes - including World No. 644, Gooch.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonny_leighfield@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Jonny Leighfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour_of_Australasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour of Australasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby league team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LLN7affe4hhnMNB9iGXFXU-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Headlining the group will be Brooks Koepka, who is the only active LIV Golf member to win a major after joining the tour.\n\nSix-time major winner Phil Mickelson entered the conversation this week after issuing a warning about the future of golf in a since-deleted post on social media where he questioned the level of competition without some of the game's best players.\n\nMickelson, a two-time winner at the PGA Championship, will be among the LIV players at Valhalla next week.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paulina_dedaj@foxnews.com", "name": "Paulina Dedaj", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Steele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/05/1024/512/Louis_Oosthuizen.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-07", "dateEnd": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 970, "textEnd": 978}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

WJBC mourns loss of former radio host Scott Laughlin\n\nAnd it did.\n\nHe made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child.\n\nRory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple. And then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Sports Golf Games And Toys Boxing Tv Broadcasting Law Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign

LIV Golf also boasts 16 players in the field, including world No. 644 Talor Gooch, who received an invitation.\n\nOne notable absence is Louis Oosthuizen, a LIV member and current world No. 125, who has finished first, first and second in his last three non-LIV, world-ranked starts dating to last December's win at the Alfred Dunhill Championship.\n\nOosthuizen is also fourth in LIV's point standings through seven starts.\n\nAccording to the AP's Doug Ferguson, Oosthuizen was offered an invitation to compete by the PGA, but he turned it down because of \"personal commitments.\" Ferguson added that the specifics of those commitments were unknown.\n\nOosthuizen owns one major victory, the 2010 Open Championship, plus six runner-up finishes in majors, including at the 2017 and 2021 PGAs.

But he doesn't necessarily see the need for it, either.\n\nGolfers currently playing on the Saudi-backed league are still unable to attain Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) points, meaning they're only able to play in the four major championships via a special exemption from the event organisers. As talks between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - the backers of LIV Golf - continue to drag on with no end in sight, Whan conceded that a a LIV track to the U.S. Open could emerge should the two series remain divided.\n\n\"If you asked me a year ago, 'What's it going to be like in three months?' I would have confidently given you an answer. I would have been confidently wrong,\" he told Golfweek. \"If LIV stays as a separate entity and keeps the quality of players that it's got, can I envision a pathway to the U.S. Open through LIV? I can, but I'd like to see what the final product is, and we're just not exactly sure we know that yet.\"\n\nREAD MORE Rory McIlroy was struggling to have fun on PGA Tour until being taught 'great lesson\n\nREAD MORE 7 LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, 36 players from LIV had entered the U.S. Open qualifying stages, with eight already extended exemptions into the PGA Championship field: Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Tyrrell Hatton, Brooks Koepka, Martin Kaymer, Phil Mickelson, Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm.\n\nTalor Gooch, meanwhile, was one of seven LIV golfers to receive an invite to the third men's major of 2024. The series' 2023 individual champion hasn't competed on other OWGR-acknowledged tours since June 2022, marking the first time the PGA of America has recognized a player's accomplishments on LIV.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US .\n\nWhen asked if the USGA felt any need to form new pathways for players that defected from the PGA Tour instead of simply encouraging them to qualify for championships, Whan said: \"Well, it's a little bit of both.\n\n\"I would say that, a lot of people forget the first LIV event happened the weekend before the U.S. Open in 2022 and a lot of players were suspended and that's kind of where the frustrations and challenges came in professional men's golf,\" he continued. \"And everybody was wondering what's the USGA, what is the U.S. Open going to do?\n\n\"And we said, quite simply, if you've qualified for the U.S. Open you are going to play in the U.S. Open and [we] sent a pretty clear message early on. Last year, in 2023, we had [and I'm] not sure if I have my numbers exactly right but we had 15 LIV players played at LACC. Of the 50 players that we are calling LIV players, that's 30 percent of their tour teed it up at LACC.\n\nIf players on LIV want to play in the U.S. Open, Whan insisted the opportunity is there for the taking. \"I think this year between the seven or eight players that have qualified through major wins there's another 29 or 30 players that are already exempt into the final stage of qualifying,\" he concluded. \"If they want to qualify, that's up to them. But nothing is stopping you from playing the U.S. Open and nothing ever has and nothing ever will.\"", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_neschis@irishmirror.ie", "name": "Matthew Neschis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/incoming/article32766210.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-2151521110.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that went,\" Koepka said, living up to his reputation of cutting to the chase. \"I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child. Rory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple.\n\nAnd then he won another major.\n\nTwo days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster.\n\nHe doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there.\n\nThere's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nTags Sports Golf Games And Toys Boxing Tv Broadcasting Law Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

Koepka will be one of the most closely watched players at Valhalla Golf Club, as he is no less than the defending champion.\n\nBrooks Koepka has won the PGA Championship three times, twice in a row (2018 - 2019). In the 2024 edition, he had the opportunity to repeat this feat and the matter did not go unnoticed by the press.\n\nAt a press conference during the recently concluded LIV Golf Singapore, Brooks Koepka had this to say about his consecutive majors won:\n\n\"I've gone back to back at the PGA [Championship] and the US Open. Hopefully looking to do it again, I don't know if it's ever been done but that'd be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nBrooks Koepka is one of only two players to have won two consecutive editions of the PGA Championship. The other to do so was none other than Tiger Woods.\n\nTiger Woods himself also holds the record that Brooks Koepka will be trying to match at the PGA Championship in 2024, successfully defending his title twice in the event. Woods did it by winning in 2000 and repeating in 2001, then winning in 2006 and repeating in 2007.\n\nAs for the U.S. Open, Brooks Koepka (2017-2018) is the seventh player in history to accomplish this feat. Previously, the feat was accomplished by Curtis Strange (1988 - 1989), Ben Hogan (1950 - 1951), Ralph Guldahl (1937 - 1938), Bobby Jones (1929 - 1930), John McDermoth (1911 - 1912) and the only player to win three consecutive titles, William Anderson (1903 - 1904 - 1905).\n\nKoepka has a brilliant record at the PGA Championship, with three wins, one-second place, and two other top 5s. He has never missed the cut in this event and his worst result was finishing T70 in 2013.\n\nBrooks Koepka's 2024 season, heading to the PGA Championship\n\nPrior to playing LIV Golf Singapore, Koepka stated that he was concerned about the quality of his game, he said (via LIV Golf news service):\n\n\"Clearly not very good, with Augusta the way that it went. I kind of felt like I wasted all the time from December until then. Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nUp to that point, Koepka had only finished in two top 10s at LIV Golf, while at The Masters he finished T45.\n\nBut in Adelaide, Koepka gave a sign of where he was heading by finishing 10th. A week later, he won the Singapore event in emphatic fashion, with rounds of -5, -7 and -3, for a score of 15 under.\n\nWith this result, Koepka placed fifth in the individual standings for the 2024 season in LIV Golf, but he was also in the form that has seen him win five majors in just 11 seasons of his professional career (2024 is his 12th).", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julio_valdera@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Julio Valdera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Guldahl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ralph Guldahl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hogan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Hogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Strange", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Strange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Jones_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Jones (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/073d5-17151143641335-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

While most pros have spent weeks, if not months, trying to earn a spot in the field, one former major winner and current LIV pro received an invite but decided not to play, according to a new report.\n\nOn Tuesday, the PGA officials announced the preliminary field for next week's major, featuring 154 players in what will be a 156-player field. Included on that list were six pros who now ply their trades with LIV Golf and who weren't otherwise qualified.\n\nThree of them -- Adrian Meronk, Patrick Reed and Lucas Herbert -- are ranked in the Top 100 in the Official World Golf Ranking. Three others -- David Puig, Dean Burmester and Talor Gooch -- proved their value with their play on the Asian Tour, DP World Tour and on LIV.\n\nBut there was one glaring absence from the LIV invitees list: Louis Oosthuizen.\n\nNot only is Oosthuizen a major champion, thanks to his blowout victory at the 2010 Open at St. Andrews, he's also had numerous near-misses on golf's biggest stages. Oosthuizen lost the 2012 Masters to Bubba Watson in a playoff. He finished runner-up at the 2015 U.S. Open and T2 at the 2021 U.S. Open. As for the PGA, he also has two runner-up finishes there, earning T2s in 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe fact that his name was missing from the field was even stranger given the fact that he won two DP World Tour events in December.\n\nBut now, thanks to the AP's Doug Ferguson, we may have some insight into why Oosthuizen won't be at Valhalla along with his fellow LIV compatriots.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Ferguson tweeted, \"Turns out PGA offered Oosthuizen an invitation. He turned it down because of personal commitments. Not sure what those were.\"\n\nIf that report is true, it means PGA Championship officials did deem Oosthuizen worth of participating in their event, and they did want him in the field. Oosthuizen, however, declined the invite for personal reasons.\n\nThanks to his DP World Tour wins, Oosthuizen in now ranked No. 125 in the Official World Golf Ranking. He had moved all the way up to No. 107 after a runner-up at the International Series Oman event in February, but that wasn't enough to make the Masters field last month, for which he did not receive an invite, or for an automatic invite into the PGA.", "source": {"uri": "golf.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Puig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Puig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Meronk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Meronk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Herbert_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Herbert (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrews", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St Andrews"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Series_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Series (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://golf.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/louis-oosthuizen-liv-pga.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Whether it's adding players as it did last offseason with Jon Rahm, Tyrrell Hatton and Adrian Meronk; or growing its business side as it has this year by adding a chief financial officer and chief marketing officer, among others.\n\nAnd LIV's chief pot stirrer, at least among the players, Phil Mickelson, continues to drop hints about more raids on the PGA Tour.\n\nMickelson responded to a tweet about the lack of LIV golfers in the major championships by responding \"What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year?\"\n\nMickelson and LIV chief officer and commissioner, Palm Beach Gardens' Greg Norman, made the same promise following the 2022 and 2023 seasons. It didn't go so well two years ago but the league made up for that last off season by signing with Rahm and Hatton.\n\nWith seven events down and seven remaining in LIV's third season -- next up Houston June 7-9 -- some observations on the league headquartered in West Palm Beach:\n\nBrooks Koepka's win last weekend at Singapore makes him the first LIV golfer with four career titles. But the number he really cares about is five, as in his number of major championships.\n\nThe Jupiter resident will chase his sixth major next week at Valhalla, site of the PGA Championship. Three of those major wins are the PGA Championship, including last year at Oak Hill outside of Rochester.\n\n\"Everything was really solid,\" Koepka said following his win at Singapore. \"I didn't really think I made too many mistakes. It's a great feeling when it kind of feels easy, if you get what I'm saying.\n\n\"I like the way things are trending.\"\n\nJoaquin Niemann, the Chilean who lives in North Palm Beach, is carrying his strong offseason that got him invites to the Masters and PGA Championship into the LIV season.\n\nNiemann leads the individual standings with a 134.4 points. Rahm is second at 98.17. Niemann has two wins and has been in the top 10 in all but one event.\n\nCrushers with captain Bryson DeChambeau, Palm Beach Gardens' Anirban Lahiri, Paul Casey and Charles Howell III, lead the team standings.\n\nNiemann also leads the money list thanks to those two titles that earned him $4 million each. With $10,888,000 in prize money, he leads Dean Burmester ($7,258,013) and Koepka ($6,080,500).\n\nNiemann has earned $19.2 million in less than two years on LIV (he joined in August 2022). He made $15.1 million in prize money in 122 events on the PGA Tour dating back to his first event in 2017.\n\nJon Rahm boosted LIV's profile after leaving the PGA Tour in December. He is off to a strong start in his new league with top 10 finishes in all seven events, including twice tying for third.\n\nAnd while Rahm has never mentioned regretting the decision that will net him a reported $550 million over three years including bonuses -- plus prize money of which he already has topped $5 million this season -- he did admit to being \"emotional\" when thinking about what he has given up.\n\nRahm said driving by TPC Scottsdale in his home town, and knowing he is ineligible for events like the Phoenix Open and those in Palm Springs and at Torrey Pines is difficult.\n\nThen he thinks about a half billion dollars and all that goes away.\n\nAlthough results are the least important part of Anthony Kim joining LIV and getting his life back in order, it can't be ignored that the one-time world No. 6 continues to struggle on the course.\n\nKim has played five events as a wild card and has not finished better than 50th in the 54-man fields. He has placed 52nd, 54th, 53rd, 50th and 52nd. Still, his combined 52-over par has earned him $260,000.\n\n\"As important as golf is, I just want to be in the right mental place,\" Kim said at the LIV event at Doral. \"I would get upset if I played a bad round of golf for two weeks, and it would bother me, eat at me.\n\n\"(Now) I could care less what I shot. I know that the next day, I'm going to lace up any shoes or not lace up my shoes and go try my best again.\"\n\nTalor Gooch enjoyed playing the martyr this season for being left out of the majors. But LIV's 2023 individual champion finally got his wish.\n\nGooch announced on social media Monday he will be headed to Valhalla next week, thanking the PGA of America for the invite.\n\nGooch's special exemption makes him the 10th LIV golfer in the PGA Championship field, compared to 13 in the Masters. Next up is the U.S. Open in June at Pinehurst. Of LIV's 46 non-exempt players for the U.S. Open, 35 are scheduled to compete in final qualifying including Niemann, Sergio Garcia, Patrick Reed and Harold Varner III.\n\nGooch said he was not joining them. Perhaps he knows that may not be necessary.\n\nLee Westwood, 51, is the poster child for the fading star who decided to cash in one last time by joining LIV. A former world No. 1, Westwood was one of LIV's original golfers. He did so midway through a season (2021-22) in which he had one top 25 finish in 10 events.\n\nWestwood is one of just three LIV golfers who have yet to earn a point this season, along with Kim and Hudson Swafford. His best finish is T32 in LIV's season opener at Mayakoba. Only the top 24 finishers in each event earn points. If it weren't for Westwood being a team captain he would be in danger of facing relegation.\n\nTom D'Angelo is a senior sports columnist and golf writer for The Palm Beach Post.

They join a few others who were already in the field, so the tour will be well-represented in Valhalla next weekend. They won't outnumber the other tours, but there are several members with a shot at winning one of golf's ultimate prizes.\n\nWith these six golfers being invited, the field has more talented golfers than it did before, but fans on social media aren't that excited about their addition. Many believe these six won't do much in the tournament, with a few going as far as claiming they won't even make the cut.\n\n\"Now the LIVidiots will just pivot to whining about althe next perceived slight, in 3....2....1.....,\" an angry fan claimed.\n\n\"All for them to lose to this guy,\" was another comment.\n\nNot everyone was unhappy or disappointed with these selections, though. Some were glad to see the LIV stars getting their time in the limelight at the PGA Championship next weekend.\n\nGooch's addition to the field is a notable one. He was one of the most vocal about LIV Golf players being glossed over for The Masters. He was pretty upset that he wasn't invited to Augusta, and said that the tournament might have an asterisk if he and LIV's best weren't in the field.\n\nHe also said he wasn't going to try and play U.S. Open qualifiers to cement his place in that field next month, likely hoping for a special invite. He got one to the PGA Championship, and now he has the chance, along with the other invites, to prove he belongs with this level of competition.\n\nPadraig Harrington cautions LIV Golf players for future Major tournaments\n\nThose six LIV players are not the only LIV Golf members in the field for the PGA Championship. Reigning champion Brooks Koepka, Phil Mickelson, Joaquin Niemann, and others will be as well. When they all convene at Valhalla, Padraig Harrington has a word of advice for them.\n\nHe noted via SB Nation that their language was more unsavory than others at The Masters last month:\n\n\"There was quite a bit of... on the Masters... there was an awful lot of extra expletives from LIV players,\" Harrington said. \"Clearly, LIV players don't get fined for expletives, and I'm not saying they're encouraged, but they're certainly not discouraged from doing it.\"\n\nHarrington says they don't have to hold back, and that's something he's not a fan of. He went on to say that he doesn't care if they smash up a golf club out of frustration, and if they want to take anything out on themselves, that's fair game.\n\nBut in his mind, doing anything to the course or the surrounding fans, which in this case would be using profane language around them, needs some \"moderation\", as he put it.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golf_tours", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golf tours"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P\u00e1draig_Harrington", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "P\u00e1draig Harrington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Country club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/701cf-17150964013155-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

He has yet to record a hole-in-one, but he did secure an M.A. in Sports Journalism from St. Bonaventure University.\n\nOn a recent call with the media, South African Trevor Immelman, the lead analyst for CBS Sports, expressed his surprise at Louis Oosthuizen's omission from the 2024 PGA Championship.\n\nDataGolf lists Oosthuizen, also a South African, as the 32nd-ranked player in the world. This past December, he won the Alfred Dunhill Championship and the AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open on the DP World Tour. He also finished second at the International Series Oman in February and has recorded four top-10s in LIV Golf events this season.\n\nPlus, the South African has proven himself on the biggest stages before, winning the Claret Jug in 2010 and coming close to claiming a Green Jacket at Augusta National in 2012.\n\nOosthuizen has also tied for second twice at the PGA Championship, in 2017 and 2021.\n\nHence, when the PGA of America released its field for the 106th PGA Championship early Tuesday, everyone, including Immelman, was shocked to see Oosthuizen not included.\n\nBut come to find out, Oosthuizen declined the PGA of America's invitation, per Doug Ferguson of The Associated Press and Bob Harig of Sports Illustrated.\n\nFerguson noted that Oosthuizen turned down the invite to compete in the \"strongest field in golf\" for personal reasons. Specific details are unknown.\n\nNevertheless, the PGA of America invited six more LIV Golf players in addition to the nine that had already gained entry through different qualifying criteria.\n\nTalor Gooch, who, unlike Oosthuizen, has not played in any events outside of LIV Golf, received an invite. As did young up-and-comer David Puig, who has followed in Oosthuizen's footsteps and competed in numerous events around the globe outside of LIV.\n\nOosthuizen's fellow countryman, Dean Burmester, will play at Valhalla. So, too, will Australian Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk of Poland, and 2017 Masters champion Patrick Reed.\n\nIn all, 15 players will tee it up at the 2024 PGA Championship, while 16 received invites. Last year, at Oak Hill, 18 LIV Golf players teed it up, but that did not include Oosthuizen. He did not meet the qualifying criteria, nor had he played well enough to receive an invite from the PGA of America in the months leading up to Oak Hill.\n\nBut he has vastly improved his game over the past eight months, which explains why he received an invite this time around.

Seven of those have been handed special invites, with the league's membership continuing to drift down the world rankings.\n\nThe headline name on the invite list is that of Talor Gooch, who has been handed his first start at a major championship since being crowned LIV's 2023 champion. Gooch found career-best form last season, winning three times on the Saudi-backed circuit, before lifting the year-long crown.\n\nREAD MORE: 7 LIV Golf stars earn PGA Championship invite as Talor Gooch and Patrick Reed handed major lifeline\n\nREAD MORE: Luke Donald's Ryder Cup preparation speaks volumes amid Tiger Woods uncertainty\n\nHis efforts were not recognised in the rankings, though, with LIV continuing to host its events without Official World Golf Ranking points on offer. This has seen Gooch drift down the world list to 644th, thus making him ineligible to compete in the four major events of 2024.\n\nAfter missing the Masters last month, he will make his major return though following his invite to the PGA. He is also joined by Joaquin Niemann, Patrick Reed, Adrian Meronk, David Puig and Lucas Herbert on the special exemption list, after the field for the championship in Kentucky was released on Tuesday.\n\nOne glaring absentee from the list though was Oosthuizen. It has since been reported by The Associated Press that the 41-year-old opted to turn down an offer to compete due to unknown commitments in his personal life. The South African has been in impressive form in recents months, competing across the Saudi-backed league, DP World Tour, Sunshine Tour and Asian Tour.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nLouis Oosthuizen has been in impressive form\n\nOosthuizen - who is a former Open champion - has starred away from LIV so far this term, winning back-to-back titles on the DP World Tour and Sunshine Tour in December. The South African won on home soil at the Alfred Dunhill Championship, before collecting the Mauritius Open title one week later.\n\nThe LIV star also finished second at the Asian Tour's International Series event in Oman in February, and has finished runner-up on two separate occasions on the breakaway circuit in Jeddah and Adelaide. He currently sits fourth in LIV's season-long rankings, after three top-10 finishes in his last five starts.\n\nOosthuizen missed his first Masters since 2008 last month, after his fall down the world rankings saw him miss out on qualification for Augusta National. The South African went on to call for 'complete change' in order for the four flagship events to be more accessible for LIV stars.\n\nHe told Gulf News: \"I think the whole system needs to change completely.If they don't want to give us World Ranking points on LIV Golf then they should change the system where they give spots to Majors on each tour around the world or something like that. I'm surprised those (OWGR) guys have a lot more experience than me, sitting on boards and doing their things, that I can't believe there's no solution to it.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lees@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Lees", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Puig", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Puig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Meronk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Meronk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Herbert_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Herbert (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunshine Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asian Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dunhill_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alfred Dunhill Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mauritius"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32200692.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_GettyImages-1852200535.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Was it regret following a moment of anger? Or perhaps the incoming LIV Golf Chief Marketing Officer asked Phil to delete the tweet? Either way, the retraction may signal LIV Golf taking a more conciliatory approach with the PGA? Or more intriguing, that LIV Golf is now ready to build out its global brand and its audience all on its own, and not in relation to the PGA.\n\nAs we wrote earlier this month, Phil Mickelson is focusing on his legacy and contemplating retirement. \"Mickelson sounds downright wistful,\" we noted. And after admitting his career was \"towards its end,\" Phil told Bloomberg, \"there are moments when you're on a golf course alone, and you have this solace and you're at peace.\"\n\nWistful or not, Phil is certainly not happy with how PGA is treating LIV golfers, where LIV tournaments aren't part of the qualifying for the upcoming PGA Championship (and other majors). On Sunday, May 5, 2024, Mickelson tweeted \"maybe some LIV players won't be missed but what if NONE of the LIV players played (in the PGA Championship)? Would they be missed? What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year? At some point they will care and will have to answer to sponsors and television. FAAFO.\"\n\nIt wasn't his anger at LIV tournaments not being recognized by the PGA or Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR). It was Mickelson's not-so-veiled threat that LIV was going to poach more top golfers from the PGA that caught everyone's attention. \"What about next year when more great players join? Or the following year?\" True, Mickelson deleted the tweet shortly after posting it. Deleting angry or stupid tweets, something callous or foolish stated in the heat of the moment, that's not a surprise. What is a surprise is that nothing Mickelson tweeted appeared to be untrue. It's widely expected that LIV Golf will go after more top PGA players. There is still no sanctified pathway for LIV golfers to qualify for majors by playing in LIV tournaments. Without top LIV golfers, many of whom are among the best golfers in the world, almost certainly viewership and sponsorship of PGA events will be diminished. Everything Mickelson tweeted passes muster.\n\nPerhaps neither Phil Mickelson nor LIV Golf are ready to declare a truce with the PGA. Maybe they simply no longer care. And are going after bigger prizes. This becomes more obvious when tracing recent statements made by LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman-and in LIV's recent hiring of Pepsico executive, Adam Harter, as LIV's new Chief Marketing Officer (CMO).\n\nConsider that Norman recently admitted that LIV wanted to buy up top golf courses, similar to how NASCAR owns many of the racetracks it runs on, and then transform these courses into economic centers in their own right. Golf course, residential properties along the course, restaurants and shop, merchandising, all one locus of golf-related activity. \"Think about LIV owning all their own golf courses, each team having a home venue (which) they host. And now you can build out around that. It's not just a golf course. You bring in education, you bring in hospitality, you bring in real estate, you bring in merchandise,\" Norman said.\n\nSoon after Norman's business plan admissions, LIV announced the hiring of Harter. It was a day after Mickelson deleted his tweet, in fact. Coincidence? According to LIV, Adam Harter will \"lead all marketing activities, including developing the league and team brands, growing the size and engagement of the global fan base, delivering unique and dynamic marketing initiatives for LIV Golf and The International Series, and championing partnerships to continue advancing the sport of golf around the world.\"\n\nWhat's especially intriguing about Harter is that part of his Pepsico branding work included \"transformative deals\" with the NBA, NFL, and NASCAR superstars, and overseeing the Pepsi Super Bowl Halftime show. Deliberately chasing a younger, more global audience. Greg Norman has stated that LIV Golf is going after a younger audience, an audience that may catch a few minutes of a tournament on their phone. Harter appears to be primed to flesh this out. Of course, Pepsi still lags behind Coke. Is LIV Golf destined to be the new Pepsi to PGA's traditional Coca-Cola?", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_s_hall@heavy.com", "name": "Brian S Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Norman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_International_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL International Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PepsiCo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2150374777.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But he doesn't necessarily see the need for it, either.\n\nGolfers currently playing on the Saudi-backed league are still unable to attain Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) points, meaning they're only able to play in the four major championships via a special exemption from the event organisers. As talks between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - the backers of LIV Golf - continue to drag on with no end in sight, Whan conceded that a a LIV track to the U.S. Open could emerge should the two series remain divided.\n\n\"If you asked me a year ago, 'What's it going to be like in three months?' I would have confidently given you an answer. I would have been confidently wrong,\" he told Golfweek . \"If LIV stays as a separate entity and keeps the quality of players that it's got, can I envision a pathway to the U.S. Open through LIV?

The series' 2023 individual champion hasn't competed on other OWGR-acknowledged tours since June 2022, marking the first time the PGA of America has recognized a player's accomplishments on LIV.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nMike Whan said LIV players are more than welcome to try and qualify for the U.S. Open\n\nWhen asked if the USGA felt any need to form new pathways for players that defected from the PGA Tour instead of simply encouraging them to qualify for championships, Whan said: \"Well, it's a little bit of both.\n\n\"I would say that, a lot of people forget the first LIV event happened the weekend before the U.S. Open in 2022 and a lot of players were suspended and that's kind of where the frustrations and challenges came in professional men's golf,\" he continued. \"And everybody was wondering what's the USGA, what is the U.S. Open going to do?\n\n\"And we said, quite simply, if you've qualified for the U.S. Open you are going to play in the U.S. Open and [we] sent a pretty clear message early on. Last year, in 2023, we had [and I'm] not sure if I have my numbers exactly right but we had 15 LIV players played at LACC. Of the 50 players that we are calling LIV players, that's 30 percent of their tour teed it up at LACC.\n\nIf players on LIV want to play in the U.S. Open, Whan insisted the opportunity is there for the taking. \"I think this year between the seven or eight players that have qualified through major wins there's another 29 or 30 players that are already exempt into the final stage of qualifying,\" he concluded. \"If they want to qualify, that's up to them.

The campaign aims at promoting responsible gambling habits, such as setting a budget and viewing betting as entertainment rather than a reliable way to earn money.\n\nThe PGA of America's online and social media accounts will share \"co-branded responsible gaming content\" throughout next week, when the PGA Championship begins.\n\n\"As the PGA of America welcomes ESPN BET as the Official Sports Betting Sponsor of the 106th PGA Championship, it is core to our values to ensure golf fans have the right tools in their bag to bet responsibly,\" PGA of America Chief Commercial Officer Jeff Price said in a press release. \"Activating AGA's Have A Game Plan campaign during this year's PGA Championship and beyond will be an integral part of our strategy as interest in golf wagering grows.\"\n\nScottie Scheffler is currently the heavy favorite to win the PGA Championship across multiple betting apps, with ESPN BET giving him +350 odds to win the tournament.

He cares about only his golf, especially when it's not going the way he wants.\n\nHe was burning inside a year ago when he played not to lose in the final round of the Masters and watched his two-shot lead turn into a four-shot loss. He vowed not to let that happen again, and he delivered a month later by claiming his fifth major title at the PGA Championship.\n\nKoepka found more motivation in failure already this year. That he was an afterthought in five LIV Golf events wasn't nearly as irritating as being a no-show at Augusta National. He failed to break par in any round and beat only 10 players who made the cut.\n\nHe was asked in Singapore how is game was trending.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Just keep grinding away, keep doing the work, and hopefully something will turn around.\"\n\nAnd it did. He made 17 birdies over three rounds in Singapore, was never seriously challenged on the final day and won by two shots. He referred to the Masters as a wake-up call.\n\nIt might be that way for others, too, especially with the PGA Championship at Valhalla next on the docket.\n\nKoepka is the first player to win four LIV Golf titles.\n\nThat doesn't make him the betting favorite at the PGA Championship. Scottie Scheffler has won four times in the last two months against far stronger fields (and over 72 holes) -- in two signature events, The Players Championship and the Masters.\n\nThe search is for who can stop him, and a couple of candidates have emerged in recent weeks as Scheffler waits at home in Dallas for the birth of his first child. Rory McIlroy won in New Orleans, albeit a team event with Shane Lowry, and restored some of the fun in golf that had been sorely missing. He won the last time the PGA Championship was at Valhalla, a wild finish in the dark with McIlroy joining the group ahead -- Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, both still with hopes of winning -- in an effort to finish.\n\nLudvig Aberg is the best futures bet on challenging Scheffler. He's a month away from completing one year as a pro and already is No. 6 in the world ranking with two wins and a Ryder Cup celebration. In his first major, he was runner-up to Scheffler at the Masters.\n\nBut there's something fascinating about Koepka, particularly in the majors, and whenever he seems to have a chip on his shoulder that he puts there himself.\n\nHe once said majors were the easiest to win because they effectively had the smallest fields by process of elimination. Koepka figured he was flat-out better than half of the 156-man field and half of those guys would be off their game. Then he began to factor in how can they handle the pressure. By his math, it was only a few guys left to beat.\n\nSimple. And then he won another major. Two days after he made those comments, Koepka opened with 63-65 at Bethpage Black in the 2019 PGA Championship to set a major championship record for 36 holes. He set PGA Championship records for largest 36and 54-hole leads.\n\nThe back nine on Sunday wasn't pretty when he made four straight bogeys and fans on Long Island began cheering for more. Unfazed, Koepka closed it out for a two-shot victory.\n\n\"It's New York. What do you expect when you're half-choking it away?\" Koepka said.\n\nNo bull. No bluster. He doesn't always deliver. There was the shade he threw Dustin Johnson's way the following year at Harding Park when Koepka was trying to become the first player to win three straight PGA Championship titles in stroke play.\n\nHe was two shots behind Johnson after 54 holes and said: \"When I've been in this position before, I've capitalized. He's only won one. I'm playing good. I don't know, we'll see.\" Koepka didn't make a birdie until the 12th hole, shot 74 and tied for 29th.\n\nHe failed to take down 50-year-old Mickelson at Kiawah Island. He lost a 54-hole lead to Jon Rahm at the Masters last year.\n\nBut he's always there. There's still a loose notion that LIV Golf's format, schedule and guaranteed riches don't prepare its players for the majors. The results don't bear that out -- three LIV players finished in the top 10 at the Masters this year and last, three in the PGA Championship last year, two in the U.S. Open.\n\nAnd it should never apply to Koepka. His record in the majors, when he is healthy, is daunting.\n\n\"I think the big thing that kind of separates me is my ability to lock in and go someplace where I think a lot of guys can't go,\" he said in Singapore.\n\nThat ability allowed him to win one U.S. Open by tying the record score to par (16 under) at Erin Hills, and win the next year with a score over par at Shinnecock Hills. He also won back-to-back in the PGA Championship.\n\n\"Hopefully looking to do it again,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's ever been done, but it would be kind of a cool thing.\"\n\nWinning back to back in the majors on three occasions has been done. Tiger Woods did it four times -- the Masters (2001-02), the PGA Championship (1999-2000 and 2006-07) and the British Open (2005-06). Just not at the U.S. Open.\n\nWoods never said it was easy. It never is. Koepka likes it that way.\n\nTags Sports Golf Games And Toys Boxing Tv Broadcasting Law Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that

LIV first filed with the Official World Golf Ranking board in July 2022, but the bid was rejected in October.\n\nCEO and commissioner Greg Norman abandoned that effort shortly after, which led him to publicly question the \"accuracy, credibility, and integrity of the OWGR rankings\" system.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nWith the first of four majors already complete, questions about LIV Golf's representation on the biggest stages in golf have continued to be raised ahead of the PGA Championship next week.\n\nIn response to a post on X that pointed to a recent example of LIV players earning more from prize purses but not receiving any world ranking points, Mickelson fired back in a since-deleted post about what the future of golf might look like if no player from the LIV tour were able to compete at the majors.\n\nBRYSON DECHAMBEAU LAUDS LIV GOLF'S POTENTIAL AHEAD OF SINGAPORE: 'BIGGER, BADDER AND BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE'\n\n\"Maybe some LIV players won't be missed.

It's a simple thing - it's nice and clean. There is some representation of what I have done in my career.

We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously, if this merger comes along, there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.\"\n\nWith no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago, one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.\n\nPGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises equity share plan. Large, as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods, $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, according to the The Telegraph.\n\nMore: LIV Golf receives big boost with seven additional golfers invited to play in PGA Championship\n\nWhen it comes to legacy, reputation and their safety, Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.\n\nPaulina Gretzky, Johnson's wife, revealed the couple receiving death threats after her husband joined LIV.\n\n\"People sending death threats and awful, awful, awful things,\" she said. \"People were aggressive that's for sure. But that's when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don't need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.\"\n\nBut financially ... Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV, while Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.\n\nAnd many others will earn tens of millions, such as Tyrrell Hatton, who reportedly signed for around $65 million.", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Swing_(2023_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full Swing (2023 TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Watson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Watson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jupiter, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jupiter, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Disabled", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Disabled", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/04/07/NPPP/73237654007-usatsi-22965662.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4471,2516,x0,y232&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Currently, golfers playing on the Saudi-backed league are still unable to earn Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) points. This means they can only play in the four major championships via a special exemption from the event organisers.\n\nAs discussions between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund - the backers of LIV Golf - continue with no resolution in sight, Whan admitted that a LIV track to the US Open could emerge if the two series remain separate, reports the Mirror. \"If you asked me a year ago, 'What's it going to be like in three months?' I would have confidently given you an answer. I would have been confidently wrong,\" he confessed to Golfweek.\n\n\"If LIV stays as a separate entity and keeps the quality of players that it's got, can I envision a pathway to the U.S. Open through LIV? I can, but I'd like to see what the final product is, and we're just not exactly sure we know that yet.\"\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, 36 players from LIV had entered the U. S. Open qualifying stages, with eight already extended exemptions into the PGA Championship field: Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Tyrrell Hatton, Brooks Koepka, Martin Kaymer, Phil Mickelson, Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm.\n\nTalor Gooch, meanwhile, was one of seven LIV golfers to receive an invite to the third men's major of 2024. The series' 2023 individual champion hasn't competed on other OWGR-acknowledged tours since June 2022, marking the first time the PGA of America has recognised a player's accomplishments on LIV.\n\nWhen asked if the USGA felt any need to form new pathways for players that defected from the PGA Tour instead of simply encouraging them to qualify for championships, Whan said: \"Well, it's a little bit of both.\"\n\n\"I would say that, a lot of people forget the first LIV event happened the weekend before the U.S. Open in 2022 and a lot of players were suspended and that's kind of where the frustrations and challenges came in professional men's golf,\" he continued. \"And everybody was wondering what's the USGA, what is the U.S. Open going to do? \".\n\n\"And we said, quite simply, if you've qualified for the U.S. Open you are going to play in the U.S. Open and [we] sent a pretty clear message early on. Last year, in 2023, we had [and I'm] not sure if I have my numbers exactly right but we had 15 LIV players played at LACC. Of the 50 players that we are calling LIV players, that's 30 percent of their tour teed it up at LACC.\"\n\nWhan has made it crystal clear that players from the LIV Golf series are not barred from the prestigious tournament. He pointed out that a significant number of players have already secured their spots through major victories or exemptions into the final qualifying stage.\n\n\"I think this year between the seven or eight players that have qualified through major wins there's another 29 or 30 players that are already exempt into the final stage of qualifying,\" he said. Whan emphasised, \"If they want to qualify, that's up to them. But nothing is stopping you from playing the U.S. Open and nothing ever has and nothing ever will.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_pilcher@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Ross Pilcher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Golf_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Golf Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Investment_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Investment Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrrell_Hatton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyrrell Hatton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golfweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golfweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Kaymer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Martin Kaymer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dustin Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/article32766751.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_gettyimages-2151521110jpgc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

However, the 15-time major champ has confirmed he's going to take a crack at the 2024 PGA Championship. Tiger was recently spotted practicing at Valhalla course and has told several outlets be plans to participate. Woods has won the PGA Championship four times in his career (the last time he won was in 2007). The 48-year-old is not expected to take the trophy this year but will no doubt be one of the biggest names to watch.\n\nThe PGA Championship comes in the wake of The Masters, won this year by Scottie Scheffler. The world's number one ranked golfer is expected to win the PGA Championship as well, with odds very much in his favor after a masterclass performance at Augusta (some sports books have Scheffler at +350 to win). After Scheffler, there's Rory McIlroy (currently around +1200) and Jon Rahm (currently around +1400). Last year's winner Brooks Koepka is showing odds at +2000.", "source": {"uri": "menshealth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Channel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_TV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sling TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hulu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Masters Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mh-5-9-pga-663d1cf263f93.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 421, "textEnd": 430}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 34, "textEnd": 42}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The league also has Jon Rahm, Cameron Smith, Bryson DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson, and Dustin Johnson -- all major winners in the past five years.\n\nBut as time wears on, exemptions into majors continue to run out.\n\nThe PGA of America has recognized this, inviting six LIV Golf players not otherwise eligible -- including Talor Gooch -- into next week's PGA Championship at Valhalla.\n\nThe same goes for the United States Golf Association (USGA), which facilitates the U.S. Open.\n\nUSGA CEO Mike Whan even envisions a scenario in which LIV Golf players qualify for a U.S. Open through a special pathway, according to an interview with Golfweek.\n\n\"If you asked me a year ago, 'What's it going to be like in three months?' I would have confidently given you an answer. I would have been confidently wrong,\" Whan said to Golfweek.\n\n\"If LIV [Golf] stays as a separate entity and keeps the quality of players it's got, can I envision a pathway to the U.S. Open through LIV? I can. But I'd like to see what the final product is, and we're just not exactly sure we know that yet.\"\n\nThirty-six LIV players have entered U.S. Open qualifying stages, per Golfweek. Eight players have already received exemptions into the field, thanks to their triumphs in recent majors or current OWGR standing. Of that list, only Tyrrell Hatton has not won a major, but since he joined LIV in 2024, his OWGR ranking has not plummeted like other LIV players who joined at the onset. Hatton is currently ranked 17th in the OWGR.\n\nNevertheless, worries over OWGR rankings could disappear if the USGA adopts a new strategy for LIV players.\n\nBut the U.S. Open prides itself on being just that: an open. Anyone can qualify, should they shoot scores low enough to make it through the qualifying stages.\n\nThe USGA rarely hands out special exemptions, too. But it recently awarded Tiger Woods a special invite to Pinehurst No. 2, the site of this year's U.S. Open. Woods is a three-time U.S. Open champion, winning in 2000, 2002, and 2008.\n\nWith all this in mind, professional golf remains divided and in disarray.

He has been part of the PGA Championship thirteen times and has a couple of runner-up finishes at the event. However, he wasn't part of the playing field last year and will remain out of action this time too.\n\nVeteran golf journalist Doug Ferguson reported that contrary to the initial reports, Louis Oosthuizen was offered a PGA Championship invitation. However, he declined it, citing undisclosed personal commitments. This is the second straight major he has not been a part of after the Masters.\n\nFans online had mixed reactions to Louis Oosthuizen turning down the invitation to the Valhalla Golf Club. While many questioned his priorities, a few came in for his support too. Here's a look at some reactions:\n\n\"Lmaooo what a legend,\" one fan wrote.\n\n\"He deserved an invite. So fair enough,\" another user wrote.\n\n\"I thought he didn't get an invite,\" this fan commented.\n\n\"So golf isn't even a priority for him.\" one fan questioned. \"Not even a major?!?! He makes \"plans\" instead prepping for a major championship? LIV really has their players locked in.\"\n\n\"Declined wow,\" this user reacted. \"Yeah his values towards the majors is definitely changing as well. Best example, Talor Gooch lol. But yeah it's interesting how LIV players are creating a dissonance/disinterest towards major championships when the PGA Tour and OWGR repel them in ways.\"\n\n\"Well that's final, the pga championship did right by all measures. Kudos to them,\" one user posted.\n\nWhen did Louis Oosthuizen last compete at the PGA Championship?\n\nLouis Oosthuizen was last seen at the PGA Championship in 2022, where he tied for 60th. Over the four days, he carded 73, 71, 73, and 72 to aggregate at 9-over, finishing 14 strokes behind the winner, Justin Thomas.\n\nOverall, Louis Oosthuizen has made 13 starts at the PGA Championship and has made the cut 10 times, including two top tens. Notably, both top-ten finishes were also runner-up finishes. His first runner-up finish came in 2017 when he aggregated at 6-under, finishing two strokes behind Thomas. Four years later, he once again came close to the title but fell two strokes behind Phil Mickelson.\n\nThe 41-year-old South African has had multiple runner-up finishes in all four major tours, but his lone win came at the Open Championship in 2010.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shobhit_kukreti@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Shobhit Kukreti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Mickelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Mickelson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations_and_Announcements", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Invitations and Announcements", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/e02ce-17151631135736-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

His week at the Oak Hill Country Club was highlighted with an ace in the final round, where he was paired with Rory McIlroy. This also earned him sponsor invitations to several events last season and an automatic spot at this year's PGA Championship for finishing in the top 15.\n\nOn Tuesday, May 7, CBS Sports announced the telecast of Block's documentary on the coming Saturday. The documentary will cover the golfer's underdog story and how he stole the spotlight last year at Oak Hill. CBS will also telecast another special 'PGA Championship Preview' on Sunday, May 12 at 2 PM ET.\n\nBoth the specials will also help build hype for this year's PGA Championship at Valhalla Golf Club, where Block will once again try to repeat last year's performance.\n\nMichael Block to compete at the PGA Championship 2024\n\nThe 47-year-old golfer will again be seen at the PGA Championship, where he came into the limelight last year and received immense love from fans. The PGA Championship 2024 will take place at Valhalla Golf Club from May 16 to May 19.\n\nThe PGA Championship will be Michael Block's third start of the season. He was previously seen competing at the American Express and the Farmers Insurance Open but missed the cut at both events.\n\nSpeaking of last season, Block's T15 finish at Oak Hill was the only cut he made on the PGA Tour. However, he made a T27 finish at the ISPS Handa Australian Open last December.\n\nBlock has competed in seven major championships but has only made the cut once, which came at the PGA Championship last year. It will be interesting to see if he can change his fortune again at the same event this time.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shobhit_kukreti@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Shobhit Kukreti", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Block", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Block"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramount+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmers_Insurance_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Farmers Insurance Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Express", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Express"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Croquet/Resorts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Aquathlon", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Aquathlon", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/98b92-17151470425990-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "dateEnd": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1457, "textEnd": 1473}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 81, "textEnd": 87}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 724, "textEnd": 729}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 998, "textEnd": 1004}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

We're the ones that took the risk for everything. So why should they be compensated? Obviously, if this merger comes along, there's gonna be a lot of guys who wish they would've signed.\"\n\nWith no final deal since the framework agreement was announced 11 months ago, one heavily discussed aspect is how PGA Tour players are rewarded and LIV golfers penalized for their decisions.\n\nPGA Tour players are being promised very large sums of money through the enterprises equity share plan. Large, as in a reported $100 million for Tiger Woods, $50 million for Rory McIlroy and $30 million for players like Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth, according to the The Telegraph.\n\nMore: LIV Golf receives big boost with seven additional golfers invited to play in PGA Championship\n\nWhen it comes to legacy, reputation and their safety, Johnson is correct. These players have made sacrifices.\n\nPaulina Gretzky, Johnson's wife, revealed the couple receiving death threats after her husband joined LIV.\n\n\"People sending death threats and awful, awful, awful things,\" she said. \"People were aggressive that's for sure. But that's when I shut it down for a little bit. I was like I don't need to look at this. Everyone has an opinion on it. Fine.\"\n\nBut financially ... Jon Rahm's sacrifice will earn him a reported $550 million including bonuses for joining LIV, while Johnson, Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka and Cam Smith reportedly all signed with LIV for more than $100 million.\n\nAnd many others will earn tens of millions, such as Tyrrell Hatton, who reportedly signed for around $65 million.\n\nTom D'Angelo is a senior sports columnist and golf writer for The Palm Beach Post.

Here we take a look at some of the key stats and facts in the only Major that is exclusively for professional players.\n\nWanamaker Trophy\n\nOne of the largest and grandest trophies in the sporting world, this piece of silverware is named after Rodman Wanamaker, who owned several department stores and was also a key player in the founding of the PGA of America. The trophy stands 28 inches high and weighs a whopping 27 pounds.\n\n99\n\nThe PGA Championship perennially showcases the strongest field in golf (a record equalling 99 of the top 100 players in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) competed last year) and also features the top 20 PGA Club Professionals. No amateurs can compete in the event.\n\n3\n\nValhalla Golf Club has hosted the tournament on three previous occasions. The first two were settled by a play-off with Mark Brooks coming out on top in 1996 before Tiger Woods needed extra holes to win four years later. Rory McIlroy beat Phil Mickelson by a stroke in 2014, which remains the last time the Northern Irishman tasted Major silverware.\n\n8\n\nRory McIlroy's eight-shot victory at Kiawah Island in 2012 remains the biggest winning margin at the tournament.\n\n128\n\nWith a 63 and a 65 in his first two rounds, Brooks Koepka set the lowest opening 36-hole score (128) in Major championship history at the 2019 PGA Championship at Bethpage Black in New York. The American went on to win the tournament for a second time, successfully defending the title he won in 2018.\n\n5\n\nJack Nicklaus and Walter Hagen hold the record for most PGA Championship victories. Hagen was victorious in 1921, 1924, 1925, 1926 and 1927 while Nicklaus won in 1963, 1971, 1973, 1975 and 1980.\n\n50\n\nPhil Mickelson holds the record for the oldest winner of a Major after triumphing at the 2021 PGA Championship when he was 50 years, 11 months and 7 days old.\n\n6\n\nThere have only been six European winners in 105 editions of the event - Jim Barnes, Jock Hutchinson, Tommy Armour, Padraig Harrington, Martin Kaymer and Rory McIlroy (x2). The last eight champions have all been American.\n\n-20\n\nJason Day became the first player to finish on 20-under par in Major Championship history in the 2015 edition at Whistling Straits. Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson have since equaled that total at the 2016 Open and 2020 Masters respectively.\n\nA first for Asia\n\nIn 2009 South Korea's Y.E Yang etched his name in the history books with a come-from-behind victory over 54-hold leader Tiger Woods at Hazeltine to become the first Asian-born male player to win a Major title.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType":

However, fans have been left baffled by one glaring omission - two-time runner-up Louis Oosthuizen.\n\nIn March, Joaquin Niemann revealed he had received a special invite to the Valhalla tournament, and now it has been confirmed that he will be followed by Patrick Reed, Talor Gooch, Dean Burmester, Lucas Herbert, Adrian Meronk and David Puig.\n\nTypically, any player in the world's top 100 the week before the tournament earns a place and, despite LIV Golf's inability to offer world ranking points, only two players among the seven with special invites, Puig and Gooch, are beneath that threshold.\n\nThat also applies to 2010 Open champion Oosthuizen, who is 125th, 19 places beneath Puig but a massive 519 ahead of World No.644 Gooch. As well as Oosthuizen's relatively high world ranking, he also has considerable pedigree at the tournament, including T2 finishes in 2017 and 2021.\n\nOosthuizen has also shown some excellent form in recent months away from LIV Golf. That included back-to-back DP World Tour victories at the Alfred Dunhill Championship and the AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open in December, and runner-up at the international Series Oman on the Asian Tour in February.\n\nDespite those achievements, there's no place for the 41-year-old, who was also absent from the 2023 tournament at Oak Hill, and that's a decision that has been questioned on social media.\n\nAP's Doug Ferguson described the omission as \"a surprise,\" while PA Media Golf Correspondent Phil Casey questioned whether Oosthuizen would be even bothered about missing out. In a similar vein, popular X golf account Flushing It wondered if Oosthuizen may have turned down an invite, writing: \"It's entirely possible he declined an offer.\"\n\nFans questioned the decision too, with one calling it a \"glaring oversight\" and another describing it as \"brutal.\"\n\nWhile Oosthuizen won't get to showcase his abilities for a 14th time at the Major, there are logical reasons why the other two LIV golfers outside the world's top 100 have received invites.\n\nGooch is the LIV Golf individual champion after a stunning 2023 that included three victories, while Puig has been in sensational form away from LIV Golf. Victory at the IRS Prima Malaysian Open was the highlight of his Asian Tour appearances so far this year, which has also included three other top-10 finishes.\n\nThe PGA Championship gets underway at Valhalla on 16 May.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_hall@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Mike Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Puig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Puig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Meronk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Meronk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Herbert_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Herbert (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AfrAsia_Bank_Mauritius_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Dunhill_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alfred Dunhill Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WGC_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WGC Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PA_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PA Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asian Tour"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jBRKqQ6dwwfFyNLdRcem5V-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 2573, "textEnd": 2579}], "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The 15-time Major champion has won this tournament on four separate occasions, most recently in 2007.\n\nAttention will also turn to Koepka's fellow LIV stars, perhaps most notably the likes of Joaquin Niemann, Patrick Reed and Talor Gooch who all received last-minute invites to the event.\n\nAhead of what promises to be another enthralling week of Major championship action, here is everything you need to know about keeping up with every minute of the action in the USA and UK.", "source": {"uri": "golfmonthly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Golf Monthly Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_fleming@golfmonthly.com", "name": "Ben Fleming", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Spieth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Spieth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaqu\u00edn_Niemann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaqu\u00edn Niemann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_National_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta National Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Reed", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Reed"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Guts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Guts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MKj3wqWUjejFftxuSxAuvj-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6627450980392158, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

The field is not of the highest caliber, with Europeans seen as likely to dominate on American soil.\n\nOne hole at The Dunes stands out above the rest: the thirteenth, aptly named Waterloo. This challenging par 4 wraps around Singleton Lake, forming a sharp ninety-degree dogleg right around the water. Overall, the course will present a formidable test for PGA Tour golfers, a venue that has previously hosted the 1962 U.S.\n\nWomen's Open, the PGA TOUR Champions' Tour Championship, the PGA TOUR Q-School, and the 2017 U.S. Women's Amateur Four-Ball. The technical favorite of the day is Ryan Fox. The New Zealander is currently the highest-ranked player in the field, sitting at number 66 in the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nAlongside him, attention is also on South African Erik Van Rooyen, a PGA Tour winner, and Europeans Thorbjorn Olesen and Victor Perez. Both the Dane and the Frenchman are in pursuit of their first wins on American soil after successes on the DP World Tour, formerly the European Tour.\n\nLeading the American contingent is four-time PGA Tour winner Daniel Berger, with Patrick Fishburn recently making waves. The PGA Tour is an organization responsible for overseeing the main professional golf tours in the United States.\n\nIt is headquartered in Ponte Vedra Beach, a suburb of Jacksonville, Florida. The organization is officially spelled in all uppercase letters as \"PGA TOUR\". The PGA Tour became an independent entity in 1968, following its split from the PGA of America, which is now primarily an association of golf professionals such as instructors and club managers.\n\nInitially, tournament players formed their own organization, the Association of Professional Golfers (APG). Later that year, they dissolved the APG and agreed to operate as the PGA \"Tournament Players Division,\" a completely autonomous division of the PGA under the oversight of a new 10-member Tournament Policy Board.\n\nThe name was officially changed to \"PGA Tour\" in 1975. In 1981, the PGA Tour had a marketing dispute with the PGA of America and decided to officially change its name. From the end of August that year, it became known as the \"TPA Tour,\" which stands for \"Tournament Players Association.\" The dispute was resolved within seven months, and the tour's name reverted to \"PGA Tour\" in March 1982.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_gussoni@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Andrea

The line-up of 156 players is filled with former champions, the world's top 100, Major winners over the past five years, special invites and others.\n\nAnd it's the top-100 aspect of it is where PGA Tour pro Dylan Wu is a little confused. Not that he appeared to be complaining about his own prospects during a brief rant on social media earlier this week.\n\nThe World No.154 wondered how certain players right on the edge of the world's top-100 - such as SH Kim and Chan Kim - were overlooked for an invite when multiple players much further down the rankings were awarded a spot.\n\nQuoting the PGA Championship's post about the full field being confirmed, Wu said: \"Why is there never \"real\" qualifications for the PGA Championship? You have a points list and world-ranking invite. Usually just outside top 100 in OWGR gets in. Chan Kim ranked 104th in OWGR doesn't get in. SH Kim at 107th isn't in.\n\n\"Jesper Svennson ranked 108th gets in. Tim Widing 120th gets in. Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald gets a spot. A bunch of guys get leapfrogged even though they're ranked higher than others. Seems like they just invite whoever they want. Unfair to the guys on the edge like Chan and SH.\"\n\nThe PGA Championship is unique in that its qualifying/invite system allows room for manoeuvre while the other three men's Majors all have definitive qualifying criteria, leaving little room for doubt over what it takes to tee it up in one of the season's biggest events.\n\nThe next Major stop also does not include amateurs, with the 20 low scoring club pros from the most recent PGA Professional Championship eligible to tee it up.\n\nWu continued: \"Just seems like the world of professional golf is in a weird spot, and I love that the tournament invited a handful of great LIV players but figure out a correct system for a major championship where guys know they'll be in or not.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old also complained about sponsor's exemptions being handed out to Player-Directors on the PGA Tour board recently after Webb Simpson and Adam Scott were invited to play in the Arnold Palmer Invitational earlier this season.\n\nAt the time, it was Scott's third consecutive exemption into one of the PGA Tour's Signature Events while Simpson - who has recently stepped down to be replaced by Rory McIlroy - has just received his fourth sponsor's invite into the sixth Signature tournament of the year.\n\nWu said it \"doesn't seem fair\" that players receive more than one invitation to a tournament where extra money and FedEx Cup points are on the line, going on to suggest that both players' positions in the golfing establishment helped them earn a leg up.\n\nHe said: \"Great players and major champions.

This news was reported by the golf specialized website 'Tengolf.es' Puig's inclusion increases the Spanish presence at the second major of the season to three, joining Jon Rahm, the 2023 Masters champion, and Adri\u00e1n Otaegui, who qualified after his victory at the Volvo China Open on the DP World Tour.\n\nCurrently ranked 106th in the world, Puig secures his spot in the PGA Championship not through the automatic qualification which reserves places for the top 100 players but rather through a discretionary invitation from the American professional golf institution.\n\nThis invitation reflects his rising status in the golf world, particularly following his victory at the Malaysia Open in February. The PGA Championship will mark the second major appearance in Puig's career, his first being at the US Open in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, Puig has already secured his place at the British Open at Royal Troon in July, thanks to his win at the Malaysia Open on the Asian Tour. David Puig's inclusion in the PGA Championship not only highlights his achievements on the international stage but also underlines the growing prominence of Spanish golfers in major tournaments.\n\nAs Puig prepares to compete among the world's best, his participation is anticipated to be a significant milestone in his burgeoning career. Rahm attended Arizona State University, where he won 11 college tournaments, ranking second only to Phil Mickelson, who secured 16 titles.\n\nIn 2015, as an amateur, he competed in the Phoenix Open, finishing fifth. On April 1st, he ascended to the top of the World Amateur Golf Ranking, holding the position for 25 weeks before regaining it for an additional 35 weeks.\n\nThis achievement qualified him for the following year's U.S. Open and Open Championship, where he placed twenty-third in the former before turning professional, thereby forfeiting his right to play in the latter. His professional debut came at the Quicken Loans National, finishing third.\n\nHe then secured second place at the Canadian Open. At the end of the season, he earned a PGA Tour card for 2017. Rahm clinched his first victory at the Farmers Insurance Open, thanks to an eagle on the final hole, gaining entry into the world's major tournaments.\n\nAt the Mexico Championship, part of the World Golf Championships series, he finished third, two strokes behind the winner, Dustin Johnson, and then lost to Johnson in the final of the second event, the Dell Technologies Match Play.\n\nHe later won the Irish Open by six strokes and the season-ending European Tour event, the DP World Tour Championship, Dubai, also receiving the Rookie of the Year award.", "source": {"uri":

He won the Miami event in early April when he banked around R75 million for the victory.\n\nOther LIV stars in the field include last year's PGA champion, Brooks Koepka, who will be a hunting a sixth Major title, Cameron Smith and Jon Rahm.\n\nThe full field will include 156 of the best players in the game, with the last two spots to be filled this weekend, by the winners of the PGA Tour events at the Wells Fargo Championship and Myrtle Beach Classic.\n\nVan Velzen, who hails from Benoni, will be the most foreign player to SA and world golfing fans playing at Valhalla. But he has earned his place in the elite field after a stellar season.\n\nHe hit the headlines when he challenged for the SA Open title at Blair Athol in 2023, eventually finishing second and then he went on to claim a third Sunshine Tour victory in 10 months earlier this year.\n\nIn 27 tournaments in the 2023/24 season Van Velzen missed five cuts and made 11 top-10 finishes.\n\nBy winning the Order of Merit he will also tee it up at the 152nd Open Championship at Royal Troon in July.\n\nThe 2024 PGA Championship tees off next Thursday and runs to Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriston_Lawrence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thriston Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Bezuidenhout", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christiaan Bezuidenhout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_van_Rooyen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik van Rooyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Burmester", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dean Burmester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Oosthuizen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louis Oosthuizen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Smith_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Smith (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunshine Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Beach,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Myrtle Beach, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PGA-Van-Velzen-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

And he rode that success to bigger and better things as the year rolled on as just a month later he also won his first major, the U.S. Open.\n\nThe tournament will be played at the par-71 Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte, N.C.\n\nLet's take a look at who just might walk away with the trophy and that impressive check.\n\nMore: Top-rated US sports betting sites | Best sportsbook promos and bonuses\n\nWe stayed away from Rory McIlroy, the favorite this week at , in the Zurich team event when he partnered with Shane Lowry to win the title.\n\nShame on us.\n\nNow, back on his own, we're betting he takes that momentum and keeps rolling, especially with the year's second major coming up quickly.\n\nMcIlroy is one of those players who can look like he's struggling but still put up great numbers.\n\nDon't believe us?\n\nWell, he's still ranked No. 2 in the world behind Scheffler (OK, way behind Scheffler) and he's 15 in the FedEx Cup race.\n\nAnd he's in both positions with just the one win to his credit in 2024.\n\nAnd that victory earned him just 300 FedEx Cup points (instead of 500 for a regular PGA Tour win and 700 for a Signature event win) so those points aren't as impressive.\n\nWhat is impressive is he's nine-for-nine in cuts made in 2024 with his team victory and two other top 10s. He's also been in the top 25 in seven of his tournaments so he's played well enough to make an impact...just not well enough to post a solo victory.\n\nUntil this week.\n\nWe feel he's going to ramp up his game as the year's second major--next week's PGA Championship--is right around the corner.\n\nFor his career, McIlroy has 25 victories but only four majors.\n\nThe good news is he's won the PGA Championship twice including in 2022.\n\nHe's playing more golf in 2024 and he's dialing in the parts of his game that have proven to be costly down the stretches.\n\nWe're looking at him to win this week for another reason: He also won here in 2021.\n\nIf he does win, he's going to be in prime position to take aim at his fifth major...next week's PGA Championship.\n\nRelated: Best sportsbooks and apps for betting on golf\n\nWe've been big Collin Morikawa fans since he burst onto the PGA Tour scene in 2019.\n\nSince that time he's posted six Tour wins with his last one being the 2023 ZOZO Championship last November.\n\nBut lately it hasn't been all fun and games for Morikawa, to win this week, who also had six missed cuts in 2023 while he fought swing woes.\n\nNow his game appears to be in a good spot as he's had top 10s in two of his last three starts. He was T-3 at the Masters and solo ninth at the RBC Heritage Classic.\n\nLike McIlroy, he's looking to make sure his game is fine-tuned heading into the PGA Championship, which he won in 2020 for his first of two major victories.\n\nHe missed the cut here in 2023 when he was in the middle of his swing troubles but we're going to give him a pass as we're thinking he's going to have positive thoughts heading into this week.\n\nTake a look at Tommy Fleetwood at .\n\nHe's still in search of his first PGA Tour victory and this might just be an ideal spot.\n\nHe was T-5 here in 2023 and he's having a solid start to his 2024 campaign.\n\nHe has three top 10s in the seven events where he has made the cut (he has one MC) so he's on the first page of the leaderboard on Sunday enough to pique our interest.\n\nIn his career, he does have eight wins worldwide. On the PGA Tour he's got five runnerup finishes and five third-place finishes so he's been oh-so-close.\n\nNow's the time to cash that big paycheck and finally hoist a Tour trophy.\n\nWe're going to use DraftKings for a couple of prop bets.\n\nFirst, check out Billy Horschel to finish in the top 10 at +450.\n\nHorschel is in the field because he won the last off-field event, the Corales Puntacana Championship in mid-April (we did back him in that event) to earn his way back into the big-money events.\n\nHorschel may not be the biggest name in the field this week--not by a longshot as he's ranked just 68 in the world--but no one will fight harder once he gets his foot in the door.\n\nWe also like Taylor Pendrith to be the top Canadian finisher at +450. He just needs to beat five others: Adam Hadwin, Corey Conners, Mackenzie Hughes, Nick Taylor and Adam Svensson.\n\nPendrith comes into this event after picking up his first PGA Tour win at the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. Prior to the win, he had back-to-back T-11 finishes so he's in great form.\n\nThe win last week was his ticket into this event. We feel he's going to want to prove to everyone his win was no fluke and he deserves to be in these high-stakes tournaments.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FedEx Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyndham_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wyndham Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quail_Hollow_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quail Hollow Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Fargo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wells Fargo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collin_Morikawa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collin Morikawa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corales_Puntacana_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corales Puntacana Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Pendrith", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Pendrith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Svensson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Svensson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zozo_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zozo Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackenzie_Hughes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mackenzie Hughes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Taylor_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Taylor (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Hadwin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adam Hadwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Horschel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billy Horschel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Nelson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Byron Nelson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Fleetwood", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Fleetwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBC_Heritage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RBC Heritage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corey_Conners", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corey Conners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CJ Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/wells%20fargo%20odds%20props%20predictions%20pga%20tour_0.jpg?itok=HjPef-O4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Woods set the consecutive-cuts-made record last month at the Masters before fading on the weekend to 60th, but left Augusta National optimistic for the rest of the majors this season. He accepted a special exemption to the U.S. Open last week.\n\nNo. 644 is LIV Golf's Talor Gooch, who confirmed his special exemption from the PGA of America on Monday via his social media. His spot appears to underline the PGA of America's desire to have the strongest possible field in its major; Gooch was a three-time winner and LIV Golf's player of the year in 2023.\n\nLIV Golf's David Puig and Dean Burmester also received exemptions. Puig has won twice on the Asian Tour in the last seven months and is 106th in the world, while Burmester won back-to-back DP World tour events to end 2023 and won on LIV last month in Miami.\n\nThere are 15 LIV golfers in the field. Brooks Koepka is the defending PGA champion, a three-time PGA winner overall and coming in off a win last week in Singapore. Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson, Martin Kaymer, Phil Mickelson, Patrick Reed and Cameron Smith are other past major champions from LIV Golf in the field.\n\nScottie Scheffler, the world No. 1 who won last month at the Masters, is scheduled to compete but is on baby watch at home with wife Meredith. He is skipping this week's Wells Fargo Championship, a signature event on the PGA Tour.\n\nAs usual, the field also includes 20 PGA professionals who qualified via the annual PGA Professional Championship. The total PGA professional count is 21, as Michael Block returns after a T15 finish last year at Oak Hill which earned him a spot at Valhalla.\n\nThe winners of this week's Wells Fargo and Myrtle Beach Classic on the PGA Tour will receive spots in the field if they're not in already.\n\nBelow is the full field for the the PGA Championship, which is May 16-19.\n\n\u00c5berg, Ludvig -

Scottie Scheffler and Ludvig Aberg are the only eligible players not in the field. Scheffler had planned to miss all along because of the impending birth of his first child. Aberg has a knee issue and said he needed a week of rest. ... Quail Hollow will host the PGA Championship next year for the second time. ... Webb Simpson, a Quail Hollow member, received one of four sponsor exemptions. He has received four exemptions to signature events this year. ... The top three finishers from the CJ Cup Byron Nelson -- Taylor Pendrith, Ben Kohles and Alex Noren -- played their way into the Wells Fargo Championship through the Swing Five. Dominican Republic winner Billy Horschel also is part of the Swing Five and makes his debut in a signature event this year. ... The winner gets into the PGA Championship next week if not already eligible.\n\nTelevision: Thursday-Friday, 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (ESPN+); 3-6 p.m. (NBC Sports App and Peacock); 7-9 p.m. (Golf Channel-tape delay); Saturday-Sunday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. (ESPN+); 3-6 p.m. (NBC Sports App and Peacock); 8:30-10:30 p.m. (Golf Channel-tape delay).\n\nNotes: Nelly Korda has won five consecutive tournaments and goes for the LPGA Tour record of six in a row. She shares the record with Nancy Lopez (1978) and Annika Sorenstam (2004-05). ... Korda took seven weeks off after her first win in the streak. She is coming off her second major championship title. ... The field has eight of the top 10 players in the world. Missing are Lilia Vu, who is recovering from injury, and Charley Hull, who is playing in the Aramco-sponsored Ladies European Tour event in South Korea. ... Danielle Kang also is skipping the Founders Cup to play the Aramco event. ... Hannah Green has two wins this year and moved into the top 10 in the world for the first time in her career. ... This is the first of four straight LPGA events within driving range. Three tournaments are in New Jersey. The other is the U.S. Women's Open about an hour west of Philadelphia.\n\nTelevision: Thursday-Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday-Sunday, 5-7:30 p.m. (Golf Channel).\n\nNotes: This is the first of five majors on the PGA Tour Champions schedule. ... Steve Stricker starts a stretch of three straight majors. He is in the field for the PGA Championship next week at Valhalla and then defending his title in the Senior PGA Championship the following week. ... Two of the last three tournaments on the PGA Tour Champions have been shortened to 36 holes because of bad weather in Texas. ... Bernhard Langer tied for 31st in his return to competition after three months from tearing his left Achilles tendon. ... Stricker has won this major three of the last four years. Another victory would tie him with Jack Nicklaus for most victories in the Tradition. ... John Daly is playing on a sponsor exemption. ... Jim Furyk has a new caddie this week after encouraging Mike \"Fluff\" Cowan to leave and work for C.T. Pan on the PGA Tour.\n\nTelevision: Thursday-Friday, 9:30-11:30 a.m. (Golf Channel); Saturday-Sunday, 3-5 p.m. (Golf Channel).\n\nNotes: This new tournament is held opposite a signature event 180 miles away. ... The winner gets a spot in the PGA Championship next week but not in the Masters or a guaranteed spot in the remaining two $20 million signature events. ... Among the PGA Tour winners in the field are Wesley Bryan, Daniel Berger and Aaron Baddeley. ... Bryan was in line to play in the Wells Fargo Championship with its $20 million purse and no cut. But he was bumped from the Swing Five after the Byron Nelson. ... Bryan's brother, George Bryan, was given a sponsor exemption after failing to qualify. This is the second time the brothers have played in the same tournament. ... This gives South Carolina two events in one year. The last time that happened was when the CJ Cup went to Congaree. The other is at Hilton Head Island. ... More than 10 players in the field previously have won opposite-field events on the PGA Tour.\n\nEpson Tour: Carlisle Arizona Women's Golf Classic, TPC Scottsdale (Champions), Scottsdale, Ariz.

Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTalor Gooch gets to play in at least one major this year. On Monday, the LIV golfer announced that he had received a special invitation to compete in the PGA Championship. But, Talor Gooch's invite was not well received by golf enthusiasts. Fans were furious that the LIV golfer got an invite despite not participating in the qualifier or making any effort at all.\n\nDuring a recent episode of \"The Rick Shiels Golf Show\" podcast, Rick Shiels, along with Guy Charnock, offered his insights on the matter. The two of them emphasized how the American professional golfer had stated that he would not attempt to qualify for the U.S. Open. The 32-year-old golfer had previously shown disappointment, given that he hadn't qualified for any major this season.\n\nCharnock then went ahead and questioned whether the three-time LIV Golf title winner deserved to play at the Vallarta Golf Course next week. In response, Shiels expressed skepticism about the justification for Talor Gooch's inclusion, noting that the LIV golfer's recent form didn't seem extraordinary enough to warrant a spot in the upcoming tournament.\n\n\"It's just come as a surprise. I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it, or does deserve it, I'm just very, very shocked considering he won so many times last year. He won two of his events before the PGA Championship last year, and won one of them after. I don't know.\"\n\nGooch rarely plays outside the Saudi-backed league schedule. His invite was purely on his LIV performance last year where he ended up winning three titles and ultimately topped the LIV points leaderboard taking home an $18 million bonus.\n\nThe championship director at the PGA of America, Kerry Haigh, had already declared that the committee would consider players from all the tours, including the Saudi-funded league. But the LIV golfer's form this season has been disappointing so far, with no wins to his name. Will this hamper the golfer's ability to win the major next week?\n\nRich Shiels drew attention to the sharp difference between Gooch's recent and previous year's performance. He remarked on how phenomenal the 2021 RSM Classic winner was last year, capturing three trophies. However, this year presents a different scenario.\n\n\"It really came as a surprise to me to be honest with you because if we actually look at this year's results last year he had an unbelievable year on.. LIV don't get me wrong he's had he had three wins a second place and another top 10 finish he has three wins which is massive okay when you actually look ar this year he's now moved teams but obviously his individual performance he has yet to win this year.\"\n\nNevertheless, Shiels stated that he is eager to see how the LIV defector performs next week. Meanwhile, Charnock pointed out Gooch's recent appearances at the PGA Championship, which included missing the cut both in 2023 and 2020, finishing T20 in 2022, and T44 in 2021. Given the figures, it's quite interesting to see how Gooch fares this time around and whether he can shut everyone out with his strong record in the upcoming major.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alisha_kotadia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Alisha Kotadia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talor_Gooch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Talor Gooch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIV", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LIV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_National_Doral_Miami", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trump National Doral Miami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_golfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional golfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSM_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RSM Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/8c94fea5-untitled-design-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

He knows success at Valhalla will be as much about mental fortitude as it will be skill from tee to green and he has worked with a sports psychologist to make sure the mind is in sync with the body.\n\n\"He just said, honestly, just be a bit more mindful of everything you're doing... the crowd's going to be a bit bigger, the nerves are going to be a bit bigger, so just be a bit more mindful with what you're doing.

I love having a crowd so will definitely be looking to play some good golf and get the crowd going, for sure.\"\n\nThe world No 432 will likely not be the only New Zealander in the field in Kentucky, compatriot Ryan Fox sits slightly higher in the rankings at 61 and will be looking to improve on his strong tied-23rd finish at the PGA Championship in 2023.\n\nKobori says a practice round with Fox could be the ideal preparation as well as an opportunity to bounce a few ideas off someone with major experience.\n\n\"I didn't even think about that, but that's probably a really good idea. I might even try and jack up a practice round with Foxy and see how that goes. He's obviously played before, I think he's played in all four majors, so he probably knows what's going on more than I do.\"\n\nThe first men's golf major was played 164 years ago. In that time only eight have managed to win at their first time of asking. With that in mind, Kobori says a focus on each shot he plays and his own performance will give him an idea of where he sits against the game's elite - irrespective of where he finishes.\n\n\"I want to be able to play my game. By the end of the week I'll have a really good understanding of where my game compares to everyone else in the world. This is one of four very rare occasions where I can play against the best in the world, so I'm going to use this as an opportunity to have a bit of a benchmark to see where I'm at.\"\n\nKobori is aware of his comparative inexperience in heading to his first major championship where he will be coming up against names such as Rory McIlroy, who won the PGA Championship when it was last held at Valhalla in 2014, but acknowledges you have to start somewhere.\n\n\"I think that tournament [PGA Championship], if you exclude pro-ams, that's going to be my 18th tournament as a pro, so not many under my belt. I mean, s***, we're going into the deep end so let's do it.\"\n\nThe PGA Championship begins May 17 NZT with tee times and pairings to be released closer to the date.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_toogood@nzherald.co.nz", "name": "Will Toogood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Troon_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Troon Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Fox_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Fox (golfer)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/v2/Z6JYNN6WNFE6PPVW4P24ECH2ZA.JPG?auth=c6a3e1544a82a663b8ebdf57bd8b460a03ad4b4e85dfaad4e9741b5d13b04ddf&width=1200&height=675&quality=70&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 4267, "textEnd": 4273}], "sentiment": 0.5058823529411764, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

With 69 of the best players on the PGA Tour and many of those names who aim to factor in a week's time at Valhalla in the field, the Wells Fargo Championship is likely to produce a major championship-type leaderboard on a major championship-type test.\n\nQuail Hollow once again hosts the Wells Fargo Championship as it has done so in the past, including last year when Wyndham Clark broke through for his first career PGA Tour victory. Clark has since transformed into a completely different golfer winning the U.S. Open later that year and has since tacked on this year's AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am while consistently contending in these signature events.\n\nWhile Clark was the top man a year ago, Rory McIlroy has been on that perch over the last decade or so. Three times a winner at Quail Hollow and fresh off his 25th career PGA Tour victory and 35th birthday, the four-time major champion hopes to continue this upward trajectory ahead of his return to Valhalla -- the site of his last major championship triumph in 2014.\n\nMcIlroy's drought consists of major championships, but that of Patrick Cantlay, Xander Schauffele, Jordan Spieth, Justin Thomas, Tommy Fleetwood and Cameron Young consists of PGA Tour wins. This lot has combined to get shutout over the last two years and will hope to breakthrough for a much-needed title in Charlotte.\n\nMasters contenders Collin Morikawa and Max Homa plan to tee it up while Hideki Matsuyama and Viktor Hovland round out the action at Quail Hollow.\n\nAll times Eastern; streaming start times approximated\n\nRound 1 -

So, how do you to where the best golfers in the world are playing?\n\nThe PGA has you covered with free public shuttles.\n\nPeople who decide to use UBER, Lyft, or Z-Trip must be picked up and dropped off at the PGA Championship's Official Rideshare lot located near Valhalla Golf Club.\n\nFor an efficient Rideshare experience, PGA recommends entering \"2024 PGA Championship\" as the destination in your Rideshare app.\n\nThat's the best way for your driver to take you to the designated Rideshare lot.\n\nSpectators using rideshare will enter and exit the Championship grounds through the Main Spectator Entrance, a short walk from the Official Rideshare lot.\n\nThe PGA Championship advises that it cannot guarantee drivers and there may be extended wait times for rideshare vehicles during peak departure hours from Valhalla Golf Club.", "source": {"uri": "wlky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WLKY"}, "authors": [{"uri": "curadhan_powell@wlky.com", "name": "Curadhan Powell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Golfers'_Association_(Great_Britain_and_Ireland)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional Golfers' Association (Great Britain and Ireland)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Exposition_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Exposition Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/pga-png-6487953a48066.png?crop=1.00xw:0.997xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 624, "textEnd": 630, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1015, "textEnd": 1021, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 1057, "textEnd": 1063, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 1098, "textEnd": 1104, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-17", "textStart": 1134, "textEnd": 1140, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 1172, "textEnd": 1178, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 1214, "textEnd": 1220, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-", "textStart": 641, "textEnd": 647}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

Responses may also (occasionally) be \"Neutral\" since there's a lot of gray area in golf.\n\nDo you agree or disagree? Let us know on the SI Golf X account.\n\nBob Harig: FACT. Based on his major promise and a confidence-boosting performance, Koepka will head to Louisville as LIV's best hope. But don't count out Cam Smith, who seems to have his game coming around as well.\n\nJohn Pluym: FACT. Koepka's at his best in the majors despite his recent Masters performance. Whether that's enough to overtake Scottie Scheffler (Yes, I think he wins the PGA), we'll see. But he's definitely LIV's best hope in Louisville.\n\nJeff Ritter: FACT. He's the most proven major champion on the LIV circuit aside from Mickelson's six titles, and Koepka may be putting it together just in time to pick off one more this summer and match Mickelson.\n\nJohn Schwarb: FACT. This is a nod to Koepka but also acknowledgment that Jon Rahm still hasn't rediscovered the top gear he had before going to LIV. He's actually second in season points (well behind Joaquin Niemann) but his best finishes are a pair of thirds; wasn't he supposed to dominate and be at the top of any major discussions?\n\nBob Harig: FACT. This is likely inevitable. Koepka seems certain to win more times on LIV Golf and his future with the PGA Tour seems murky at best.\n\nJohn Pluym: FACT. I don't think there's any doubt that he wins more tournaments on LIV Golf than the PGA Tour.\n\nJeff Ritter: FACT. Perhaps someday there will be a path back to the PGA Tour for Koepka and his fellow LIV'ers, but at the moment it looks like he'll lift more LIV trophies from here on out.\n\nJohn Schwarb: NEUTRAL. Two possible paths for Koepka to go back to the PGA Tour: some kind of reunification or he returns after not signing a second LIV contract (he's believed to be signed through next year). I wouldn't put money on either but somehow I don't think he's done winning regular Tour events.\n\nBob Harig: FACT. Have been saying this and writing this for years. There was going to come a time where Tiger would need an exemption and -- if he's willing and able -- he will get as many as he wants. It's unlikely Woods would attempt to play if he felt he was was unworthy. He deserves to make that call. And if Jack got eight exemptions and Arnie got five, there's no reason why a nine-time USGA champion -- including three U.S. Opens -- wouldn't get an abundance of special invites.\n\nJohn Pluym: FACT. Jack Nicklaus won 18 professional majors in his career, including four U.S. Open titles. He received a record eight special exemptions, including five in a row until he stopped playing the U.S. Open after 2000 at Pebble Beach. So as long as Tiger wants to play in the U.S. Open, he should get as many as he wants. He's the only golfer in recent history to be on the same level as Nicklaus. As such, the USGA should keep giving him special exemptions.\n\nJeff Ritter: FACT. This shouldn't even be controversial. (Is it controversial?) Woods made the tour what it is today, and although he's diminished he can still play, as evidenced by that recent made-cut at Augusta. Is there any special exemption that will do more to boost fan interest and overall buzz than Tiger Woods?\n\nJohn Schwarb: FACT. What Woods has done to earn multiple exemptions isn't up for debate, and the truth is he is highly unlikely to take as many as Nicklaus and play U.S. Opens into his late 50s. Not sure he'll even match Arnie's five. Golf fans need to just enjoy these moments.\n\nBob Harig: NEUTRAL. This all depends on where you sit on this issue. Certainly, not even trying to qualify doesn't help Gooch's cause. He could use it as motivation. He's only hurting himself here. If he believes himself to be a major player -- why wouldn't he? -- he should do everything he can to get in the majors, even if he disagrees with the process.\n\nJohn Pluym: FACT. His Official World Golf Ranking is No. 644, and he had only one PGA Tour victory before joining LIV. So based on the facts, he is only hurting himself by not going through qualifying. And, honestly, he hasn't proved to be good enough to be deserving of a special exemption.\n\nJeff Ritter: FICTION. Skipping major qualifying is good headline fodder but it doesn't change how I perceive Gooch at all -- he has shown all of us that when it comes to career decisions, his top priority is cash. Since he didn't give a reason, I assume he is skipping the lower-paying USO to stay fresh for the $4 million top prize at LIV Golf Nashville the following week.\n\nJohn Schwarb: FACT. I don't think many fans begrudge pro golfers getting their bags of cash like other athletes but a lack of effort or caring is where they draw the line.

He played golf at Indio High School and graduated from the golf management program at College of the Desert.\n\n\"The desert is a special place. If there was a good fit, and I could fully display my talents and experience, I would absolutely be back there,\" Chavez said. \"My residence is still there. I commute to work, but the desert has a special place.\"\n\nA veteran of numerous golf facilities in the desert, Chavez is now part of the PGA LEAD program, a program that might move him forward in his desire to represent the national PGA of America as well as regional and local PGA of American sectors. PGA LEAD is an 18-month program dedicated to inclusive governance, environments, systems and structures that create the opportunity for all PGA of America Golf Professionals to develop, grow and lead.\n\nStarted in 2016, the program attempts to identify diverse members of the PGA of America, then provide them with mentoring and tools to enable them to enter leadership positions in the association.\n\n\"PGA LEAD has been around for a few years already and the whole topic about serving the association and learning the inner workings of the association kind of got me interested,\" the 50-year-old Chavez said. \"Basically this is a program to form tomorrow's leaders of the association. Get to know the inner workings of the association, how one would progress into serving at a local section or even at a national level. That was kind of interesting to me.\"\n\nMore: From amateurs to touring pros, U.S. Open local qualifying in the desert is fascinating\n\nBut PGA Lead has other goals. According to the PGA of America, which represents club professionals and teaching professionals across the country, \"This 18-month program reinforces the PGA of America's commitment to create a game, workforce and industry supply chain that better mirror America's demographics. The Association is committed to inclusive governance, environments, systems and structures that create the opportunity for all PGA of America Golf Professionals to develop, grow and lead.\"\n\nThat goal is also important to Chavez.\n\n\"I actually lived in Mexico my first years of my life. That's where I learned the game of golf, in Mexico,\" Chavez said. \"I think golf has no bounds. There are no nationalities. I use my Spanish-speaking abilities to relate to Hispanics to do my job and to do it at a high level. But I think my first language is golf.\n\n\"The years of working in golf allow me to do my job in many environments,\" he added. \"I've worked for Asian ownerships, I worked for the traditional Corporate America and the traditional homeowners association of member owner golf courses.\"\n\nLong-time pro\n\nChavez has been in the golf business 30 years, from his first job working at the now-defunct Mesquite Country Club in Palm Springs to stretches of time at Sun City Palm Desert and Sun City Shadow Hills in Indio. In that time, Chavez said he has seen the PGA of American improve its membership diversity.\n\n\"The PGA has done, it has come leaps and bounds since I have been a member of the PGA. I've been a member since 2000,\" he said. \"The leadership and the makeup of the leadership has completely evolved with the time and this program was the right fit for me.\"\n\nIn a statement about the PGA LEAD program, PGA of America president John Lindert said he is delighted with the results of the program.\n\n\"It has been tremendous to see PGA LEAD participants grow into leadership positions across the Association at both the section and national levels,\" Lindert said in the statement. \"This program continues to help bring talented PGA of America Golf professionals to the forefront of the golf industry, which will help position the PGA of America's overall mission of growing the game for years to come.\"\n\nChavez has been in leadership roles in the past as president of the Desert Chapter PGA in the Coachella Valley in 2005.

Last year, he had the fourth-best odds to win entering the tournament (+2000). He took it down by shooting 9-under at the Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, New York.\n\nScottie Scheffler, who held the second-best odds at +850, and Viktor Hovland finished tied for second at 7-under. Cameron Davis, Bryson DeChambeau and Kurt Kitayama finished tied for fourth at 3-under.\n\nJon Rahm, who was the favorite entering the tournament (+700), shot an abysmal 7-over.\n\nThis will be the fourth time Valhalla hosts a PGA Championship, with the last occasion coming in 2014. Rory McIlroy won the tournament that year, shooting 16-under to beat Phil Mickelson by a stroke.\n\nTiger Woods won the event at Valhalla in 2000, shooting 18-under to win in a playoff.\n\nScheffler is a massive favorite, currently sitting at +350 to win it all. He's been on a dominant run as of late, winning four tournaments since March, including the Masters. However, it's unclear if he'll play as he's still awaiting the birth of his first child.\n\nBeyond Scheffler, McIlroy (+1200) and Rahm (+1400) hold the second- and third-best odds, respectively.\n\nTiger Woods was included in the full field list for the event.\n\nEven though he has past success at Valhalla, Woods is still a long shot to win the tournament, as he currently sits at +10000 to win it all, similar to the odds he had to win the Masters in April.\n\nWhen you talk about Tiger, you have to bring up Phil Mickelson, who won the 2021 PGA Championship. The lefty has +15000 odds to win this year's tournament.\n\nNow that we teed off with the basics, let's approach the top favorites and my early pick to win the tournament.\n\nIf you follow me on Twitter or read this column, you know I love betting on golf long shots (+1500 to +2000 or longer). There's just something thrilling about holding a lottery ticket deep into Sunday. It also presents you with multiple hedging opportunities if you want to eliminate some of your risks.\n\nA lot of my bets are based on course history and form, so you'll soon get my full list of a couple of guys worth sprinkling pizza money on.

The all-inclusive model continued to grow in popularity in 2023, with 98% of surveyed spectators recommending its continuation for future events.\n\nHere's how it works: Upon scanning their mobile ticket, Championship+ Ticket holders will receive a wristband allowing them to redeem entrees, snacks and non-alcoholic beverages at all on-course Market concession venues.

This major men's golf tournament is set to take place from May 16-19, 2024, in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe prestigious event will return for the fourth time to the Valhalla Golf Club, a course that holds special significance for Woods.\n\nTiger Woods, a name synonymous with golfing excellence, had previously clinched victory at Valhalla in 2000, following his 1999 triumph at the Medinah Country Club in Illinois.\n\nWith four wins at the PGA Championship under his belt, the 15-time major champion is no stranger to this challenging tournament, having also secured the title in 2006 and 2007. However, the last golfer to win the PGA Championship at Valhalla was Rory McIlroy in 2014.\n\nThe upcoming tournament promises intense competition with the inclusion of 16 top players from LIV Golf, led by Brooks Koepka, the American golfer who will be defending his title after dominant performances in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe field also boasts 33 major champions, including Italy's Francesco Molinari, ensuring a high-caliber lineup that will undoubtedly captivate golf fans around the world. Eldrick Tont \"Tiger\" Woods, born on December 30, 1975, in Cypress, California, is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers of all time and a pivotal figure in modern sports.\n\nHis influence extends beyond the golf course, making him one of the most recognizable athletes of the early 21st century. Woods has claimed 15 major tournament victories, revolutionizing golf not only with his exceptional athletic performance but also by drawing a new audience to the sport.\n\nA golf prodigy from a young age, Tiger's journey through junior and amateur ranks was nothing short of remarkable. He turned professional in the summer of 1996 and by 1997, he had won his first Masters. Less than a year after turning pro, he ascended to the number one position in the world rankings.\n\nDominating the sport throughout much of the 2000s, Woods faced significant challenges including knee and back injuries, which required him to adapt and reinvent his playing style. Despite these hurdles, his commercial appeal never waned.\n\nAs the main face of Nike's golf division, Woods secured multiple lucrative endorsements, making him one of the wealthiest athletes of the decade, although his career was not without its public scandals, particularly concerning his private life in 2009.\n\nIn a remarkable comeback, at the age of 43, Woods won his fifth Masters in April 2019 -- his 15th major title and his first major victory in eleven years. This win not only marked a significant personal and professional milestone but also reinforced his status as a golfing legend.\n\nOn May 6, 2019, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by then-President Donald Trump, the highest civilian honor in the United States. In recognition of his contributions to the sport and his impact on society, Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame on March 8, 2022.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrea_gussoni@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Andrea Gussoni", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Valhalla Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medinah_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medinah Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Molinari", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francesco Molinari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypress,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cypress, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cypress, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Medal of Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Golf_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Golf Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_World_Golf_Ranking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Official World Golf Ranking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amateur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules_and_Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Rules and Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image147546.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544650", "eventUri": "eng-9544650", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 225, "textEnd": 231}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-05-06", "textStart": 2801, "textEnd": 2812}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 2590, "textEnd": 2600}], "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 452990479, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 180, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 180}}}

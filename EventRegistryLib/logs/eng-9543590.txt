(Jerilee Bennett/The Gazette via AP, File)DENVER (AP) - Colorado lawmakers passed a sweeping bill Monday to overhaul the state's lax oversight over funeral homes after a series of horrific incidents, including sold body parts, fake ashes and the discovery of 190 decaying bodies. The cases have devastated hundreds of already grieving families and shed a glaring spotlight on the state's funeral home regulations, some of the weakest in the nation. The bill will go to Democratic Gov. Jared Polis' desk for a signature after final changes in the state Senate are considered by the House. If signed, regulators would have far greater enforcement power over funeral homes, and would be required to routinely inspect facilities including after one shutters. It joins a second bill that passed both chambers last week which, if signed, would require funeral home directors and other industry roles to pass a background check, get a degree in mortuary science, and pass a national examination and an apprenticeship. The legislations' passage arrives after the 190 decomposing bodies were found at a funeral homes' bug-infested facility about two hours south of Denver. Many families were left wondering whether the cremated remains they received were actually their child's or parent's. Some have learned they weren't. Instead, some bodies were languishing in a building, some for four years. The owners have been arrested and face hundreds of charges, including abuse of a corpse. At another Colorado funeral home in February, a body was left in the back of a hearse for over a year. Colorado's funeral home regulations are some of the weakest in the nation. Funeral home directors don't have to graduate high school and regulators weren't required to do routine inspections, as is the case in many other states.

Both follow a series of horrific incidents, including sold body parts, fake ashes and the discovery of 190 decaying bodies.\n\nThe cases have devastated hundreds of already grieving families and shed a glaring spotlight on the state's funeral home regulations, some of the weakest in the nation. The bill passed Monday will head to Gov. Jared Polis's desk after the House considers a minor change by the Senate.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nThe legislation would give regulators greater enforcement power over funeral homes and require the routine inspection of facilities including after one shutters. The second bill, which is already headed to the governors' desk, would require funeral directors and other industry roles to be licensed. Those qualifications would include background checks, degrees in mortuary science, passage of a national examination and work experience.\n\nThe legislation arrived after the 190 decomposing bodies were found at a funeral homes' bug-infested facility about two hours south of Denver. Many families were left wondering whether the cremated remains they received were actually their child's or parent's. Some have learned they weren't.\n\nInstead, some bodies were languishing in a building, some for four years.

This legislative action comes in the wake of disturbing incidents that have come to light, involving several funeral homes across the state. Among the reported issues were the sale of body parts, distribution of fake ashes, and the shocking discovery of 190 decaying bodies at one facility. These revelations have not only caused immense distress to many grieving families but also prompted a swift response from the state legislature.\n\nThe bill, which is now awaiting Colorado Governor Jared Polis's signature, proposes to enhance regulatory oversight significantly. It aims to empower regulators with more robust enforcement capabilities and mandates routine inspections of funeral homes, including those that have ceased operations. This legislative effort is complemented by another bill that recently passed both chambers. This companion legislation stipulates that funeral home directors and other professionals in the industry undergo background checks, attain a degree in mortuary science, pass a national examination, and complete an apprenticeship.\n\nThe urgency for these reforms was underscored by the appalling conditions discovered at a funeral home located approximately two hours south of Denver. The facility, infested with bugs, was found to be storing 190 decomposing bodies. The owners of this establishment have since been arrested and are facing numerous charges, including abuse of a corpse. In another disturbing case from February, a body was neglected for over a year in the back of a hearse at a different Colorado funeral home.\n\nHistorically, Colorado's regulations governing funeral homes have been among the most lenient in the United States. Prior to these legislative changes, funeral home directors were not required to possess even a high school diploma, and routine inspections by regulators were not mandatory -- a stark contrast to practices in many other states. The passage of these bills marks a significant overhaul of the industry's regulatory framework, aiming to align Colorado's standards with those observed nationwide.\n\nThese legislative measures represent a critical step towards rectifying the oversight deficiencies that allowed such egregious incidents to occur within Colorado's funeral home industry. By instituting stricter regulations and oversight mechanisms, lawmakers aim to restore public trust and ensure that individuals and families dealing with loss are afforded the dignity and respect they deserve during such sensitive times.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sathish_raman@oneindia.com", "name": "Sathish Raman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Funeral home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortuary_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortuary science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Colorado", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Colorado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Polis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Polis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hearse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_diploma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school diploma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death_Care", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Death Care", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Residential_Housing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Residential Housing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Inspection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Inspection", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Regulation", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://www.oneindia.com/img/2024/05/colorado-lawmakers-pass-funeral-home-regulations-ft.jpg?06052024231724", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543590", "eventUri": "eng-9543590", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Weinstein's Saba Capital Management, a large owner in BlackRock's closed-end funds, and BlackRock, the world's biggest asset management company with more than $10 trillion in assets under management, have been locked in battle for months over the future of 10 BlackRock closed-end funds.

It also wanted investors to fire BlackRock as manager at some of the funds. \"Shareholders rejected Saba\u2019s efforts to unseat BlackRock as investment adviser and voted to support the Board\u2019s nominees at several funds,\" Glenn Hubbard, Chair of the Boards of BlackRock Closed-End Funds said in a statement. \"For the second year in a row, Saba has failed to convince shareholders that Saba will deliver more value than the funds\u2019 current stewardship and management teams,\u201d he added.

Saba has cited poor performance as the reason change is needed at the funds which jointly manage roughly $10 billion. Closed-end funds, unlike open-end funds, don't issue or redeem new shares, which can leave them trading above or below the value of the securities held by the fund. For months, Saba has argued that investors will benefit when the discount to the BlackRock funds' underlying assets is shrunk and that BlackRock should buy back shares from investors which could unlock some $1.4 billion in value. BlackRock said it has taken action to improve performance and that its directors are better choices than Saba's nominees. The battle between BlackRock, which manages money for retail investors and pension funds and advises governments, and Weinstein, who most recently made headlines by last year when he and other prominent investors tried to buy hedge fund Sculptor Capital Management after the company agreed to sell to someone else, is shining light on an often overlooked part of the mutual fund industry. Saba has taken the fight against BlackRock to court and key rulings came this week. BlackRock was advised by JPMorgan Chase, Sidely Austin LLP, Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, Stradley Ronon, and Georgeson.

It follows the Philippine release of other videos on Friday accusing China of \u201cbarbaric and inhumane behaviour\u201d for stopping its navy evacuating the serviceman stationed on the Second Thomas Shoal last month despite telling the Chinese side what it was doing. Manila said it had not been able to transport the serviceman that day as a result of China\u2019s action, but he had been evacuated the following day. But on Saturday, Global Times, a nationalist tabloid, accused the Philippines of \u201clying\u201d about the incident, saying it had sent high-speed boats to take part in \u201cillegal transport and repair\u201d operations on the BRP Sierra Madre, a second world warship grounded on the reef. The footage appeared to show the Philippine military and its coastguard transferring supplies instead of personnel while being surrounded by two Chinese coastguard ships. The video also shows what appeared to be Chinese vessels shadowing the Philippine military\u2019s high-speed boat during the supply mission. There were around 10 people on board, all of whom were in \u201cgood condition\u201d, according to Global Times. Another video posted by a news blog associated with state broadcaster CCTV also captured the Philippine ships transferring what appeared to be a fuel tank with a logo from the American company Valvoline, which the blog said could be used to stop the ship\u2019s hull corroding. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday that China would allow the Philippines to transport food and other necessities to the reef and allow the evacuation of service personnel if given advance notice, but it would not allow this to be used as an excuse to transport construction materials to help make its occupation permanent. In response to Mao\u2019s comments, the Philippine coastguard spokesman Jay Tarriela said on Saturday that \u201cthe Philippine government is under no obligation to seek permission from a country that has illegally and provocatively deployed their forces within our exclusive economic zone\u201d. The reef falls within that area. The Philippines has taken a tougher stance to its long-running territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea since President Ferdinand Marcos Jnr came to power two years ago. It has stepped up supply missions to the Sierra Madre, which was deliberated grounded in 1999 to tighten Manila\u2019s hold over the reef, and Congress has allocated funding for a permanent structure there. China insisted that the Philippines promised it would not send construction materials to repair the grounded ship under the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte, who later admitted he had made an \u201cunwritten\u201d agreement. Macros said he had not known about any such deal, adding that he was \u201chorrified\u201d and would repudiate it. Last month, China provided an audio transcript to Philippine media of a phone meeting with a senior Philippine navy official in January, in which he agreed to a \u201cnew model\u201d for the Philippines\u2019 supply missions that will require China to be informed in advance. The official later denied making any concessions to Beijing. China and the Philippines have been caught up in increasing confrontations over their disputed territories in the South China Sea over the past year, which have included collisions and China using water cannons against Philippine ships. Earlier this week Beijing also accused Manila of cutting fishing nets it placed around the Second Thomas Shoal.", "summary": "Newspaper that published the clips says they show Manila was lying about the incident last month in the Second Thomas Shoal.", "url": "https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3265914/chinese-coastguard-releases-south-china-sea-videos-counter-philippine-claims-barbaric-behaviour", "image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/06/08/ce392ed4-9728-4191-944d-bcf744d6317d_a2625958.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:32:58", "author": "Kawala Xie", "authors": ["Kawala Xie"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "cn", "sentiment": -0.483}

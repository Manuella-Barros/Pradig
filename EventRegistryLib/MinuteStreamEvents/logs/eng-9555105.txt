With relatively little participation in the cash economy, many of those won't be able to buy food even when it's available in markets.\n\n\"Immediate action is required to avert loss of life and livelihoods over the coming months,\" read part of the 45-page appeal document.\n\nChildren under the age 5 and pregnant and breastfeeding women are more vulnerable, while the risk of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation and abuse are heightening as a result of the drought, according to the appeal document.\n\nIn patriarchal Zimbabwe, children, particularly girls, are often tasked with trekking long distances to search for water, putting their safety at risk. Close to 2 million children, both boys and girls, could be forced to drop out of school due to the impact of the drought, the U.N agency said.\n\nThe drought also could exacerbate a cholera outbreak by leading to unsafe hygiene, such as lack of hand washing and and drinking from polluted wells.

The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) announced on Thursday an appeal for $430 million to assist those most in need. The appeal aims to provide \"lifesaving and life-sustaining\" humanitarian assistance to about 7.6 million people, with a focus on aiding 3.1 million individuals in the most severely affected districts over the next year.\n\nEdward Matthew Kallon, the U.N. resident humanitarian coordinator, highlighted the critical situation induced by the El Ni\u00f1o weather phenomenon, which has significantly impacted much of southern Africa. Zimbabwe, an agriculture-dependent nation that once exported food, is now among the countries hardest hit by this drought. The country's harvests for staple corn for the 2023-24 season are estimated at about 700,000 tons, marking a 70% decrease from the previous season. To meet the annual demand for humans and livestock, Zimbabwe requires approximately 2.2 million tons of corn, as per government crop assessment figures.\n\nThe U.N.'s appeal encompasses a range of assistance measures including food aid, cash transfers, and the construction of solar-powered boreholes to provide drinking water for people and livestock in dire need. The El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which warms parts of the Pacific Ocean every two to seven years and affects global weather patterns, has led to below-average rainfall in southern Africa. This year's drought is considered the worst in decades, causing extreme temperatures and floods in some areas while devastating livelihoods dependent on farming.\n\nOver 60% of Zimbabwe's population resides in rural areas, relying heavily on agriculture for their sustenance and income. However, with limited engagement in the cash economy, many are unable to purchase food even when it is available in markets. The U.N. warns that immediate action is necessary to prevent loss of life and livelihoods in the coming months.\n\nThe appeal document also draws attention to vulnerable groups such as children under five years old and pregnant or breastfeeding women who are at greater risk due to the drought. Additionally, it raises concerns about increased risks of gender-based violence, sexual exploitation, and abuse as a result of the crisis. In patriarchal Zimbabwe, children -- especially girls -- are often tasked with fetching water from distant sources, jeopardizing their safety.\n\nFurthermore, nearly 2 million children could be forced to abandon their education due to the drought's impact. The situation could also worsen a cholera outbreak by compromising hygiene practices such as handwashing and leading people to consume water from contaminated sources.\n\nThis dire situation calls for a concerted effort from international donors and humanitarian organizations to mitigate the effects of this unprecedented drought in Zimbabwe and ensure that those most affected receive the necessary support to survive and rebuild their lives.", "source": {"uri": "oneindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneindia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sathish_raman@oneindia.com", "name": "Sathish Raman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Livestock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maize"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borehole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borehole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Solar power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hand washing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cholera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violence_against_women", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Violence against women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breastfeeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breastfeeding"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Child Welfare", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Agriculture", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Food_and_Water", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Food and Water", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.oneindia.com/img/2024/05/un-appeal-for-drought-stricken-zimbabwe-ft.jpg?10052024031431", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555105", "eventUri": "eng-9555105", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

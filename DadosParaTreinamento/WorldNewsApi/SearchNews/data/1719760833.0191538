Harvard\u2019s Interim President Alan M. Gerber and other high-ranking university officials announced they had accepted the recommendation Tuesday. \u201c\u2026the university has a responsibility to speak out to protect and promote its core function. And they must speak out on issues directly relevant to the university\u2019s operation\u201d the Institutional Voice Working Group wrote in its report. \u201cThe university and its leaders should not, however, issue official statements about public matters that do not directly affect the university\u2019s core function.\u201d The move comes as a growing number of Harvard affiliates urged the school to stay silent on political issues in the wake of scalding controversy about Harvard\u2019s decisions after the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, including a statement that condemned Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel signed by former university President Claudine Gay. Gay resigned in January after a congressional hearing in which she failed to say that calls for a genocide of Jews would violate school policy. Harvard has been one of the most visible colleges struggling with campus tensions since the war\u2019s outbreak. Last week, graduates walked out of Harvard\u2019s commencement ceremony in support of Palestine and fellow students who were not allowed to receive their diplomas due to disciplinary sanctions. Working groups aimed to address when Harvard should weigh in on public issues The Institutional Voice Working Group and another group convened to address how to maintain open and civil dialogue on campus were called together by university administration in April to address questions about whether the school should speak out on controversial issues. \u201cIn recent months and years, we have heard clearly that many in our community feel constrained in their ability to express their views on critically important questions,\u201d Garber and Interim Provost John Manning wrote in a statement announcing the two initiatives. \u201cMore and more members of our community have also asked whether and when the University should use its official voice to address matters of social and political significance.\u201d The institutional voice group, composed of eight faculty members representing multiple Harvard colleges, assembled 31 focus groups made up of more than 1,000 faculty, students, staff, and alumni to help make its decision, according to the school. It also conducted an online poll and researched other schools\u2019 approach to speaking out on certain issues. Public statements will alienate students, undermine Harvard\u2019s integrity, working group says In its report, the working group said Harvard\u2019s \u201ccore function\u201d is to create an environment where affiliates can \u201cresearch, teach, and learn.\u201d \u201c[Harvard] commits itself to the values of free inquiry, intellectual expertise, and productive argument among divergent points of view,\u201d the group wrote. Speaking out on controversial issues, the report says, will make it difficult for the school to create an environment of openness to all viewpoints and ideas. \u201cIf the university adopts an official position on an issue beyond its core function, it will be understood to side with one perspective or another on that issue,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cWhen speaking in their official roles\u2026 [university leaders] should restrict themselves to matters within their area of institutional expertise and responsibility: the running of a university.\u201d Faculty members speaking on an issue based on their own expertise is acceptable because they are not speaking on behalf of the university, the report says. Other school have adopted or are considering a similar policy The new policy is a marked change for Harvard. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, former Harvard President Lawrence Bacow issued a statement saying the school \u201cstands with the people of Ukraine.\u201d \u201cThe University has been making statements about all sorts of things for a long time,\u201d Alison Simmons, a co-chair of the institutional voice group, told The Harvard Gazette. But increased political polarization and the rapid pace at which a statement can spread through social media have changed things for the school, according to Simmons. Harvard is not the first to say it will keep quiet about situations that don\u2019t affect the school directly. The University of Chicago formalized a policy of institutional neutrality on political and social issues in 1967. Vanderbilt University in Tennessee and the University of North Carolina are among the schools that have adopted a similar policy more recently. Affiliates at both Yale and Columbia universities have been calling on their schools to institutionalize the strategy. Harvard\u2019s policy does not say it is adopting a policy of neutrality, but one of silence on issues outside of its direct mission. In fact, the working groups\u2019 report found that the school \u201cis not a neutral institution.\u201d \u201cIt values open inquiry, expertise, and diverse points of view, for these are the means through which it pursues truth. The policy of speaking officially only on matters directly related to the university\u2019s core function, not beyond, serves those values\u201d the report reads. Instead of issuing \u201cstatements of empathy\u201d to students affected by global events, Harvard will focus on expanding resources to support affected community members, it said. University administrators acknowledged that it would take time for the new regulations to be codified and applied. \u201cThe process of translating these principles into concrete practice will, of course, require time and experience, and we look forward to the work ahead,\u201d administrators wrote in Tuesday\u2019s statement.", "summary": "<p>A report by a working group found that while the university is not a neutral entity, making statements about political or social issues is likely to alienate students and go against the school's mission. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/28/harvard-will-no-longer-make-public-statements-on-political-social-issues-administration-says/\">Harvard will no longer make public statements on political, social issues, administration says</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/05/28/harvard-will-no-longer-make-public-statements-on-political-social-issues-administration-says/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/harvard-66565f4239699-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:11:08", "author": "Emily Spatz", "authors": ["Emily Spatz"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.029}

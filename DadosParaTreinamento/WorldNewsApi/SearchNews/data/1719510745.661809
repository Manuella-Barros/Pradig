And there were no shortage of raised voices on the Hotline as tempers flared following Saturday\u2019s events at Hampden. Raging Rangers fan Alan Flett called in after his side\u2019s Scottish Cup Final defeat to say: \u201cOnce again, the match officials were on hand to bail Celtic out in their hour of need. Niko Raskin is half the size of Joe Hart for goodness sake! If that\u2019s a foul we may as well pack up and go home.\u201d Stuart McLeod ranted: \u201cAnother match where officiating sees only one side. How ref Nick Walsh and VAR believe Nico Raskin on Joe Hart is a foul and Liam Scales on Dujon Sterling at the other end is no foul defies belief. In every one of these games this season, Rangers have been on the end of some disgraceful decisions. The pressure that has been put on refs from the Celtic fans. Ralph Hamilton said: \u201cAnother wrong VAR call wins the cup for Celtic. Greg Taylor has two arms around 5ft 6ins Raskin when he touched 6ft 5ins Joe Hart. And if that was a foul, so was Scales\u2019 two-hand push on Sterling. VAR have won the game for them wrongly.\u201d Gary Stevenson, Newtonhill, said: \u201cWhy don't the SFA save Scottish clubs some much needed revenue and relocate to Celtic Park? It would save time on lengthy appeals and the referees could receive their instructions first hand without the need for a middle man. We all know that Celtic bias is rife in Scottish football so it's time to quit the facade.\u201d But Celtic fan Paul McArdle, Gourock, blasted back, saying: \u201cLet's get this straight before Scotland\u2019s serial losers play their victim card regarding the shove on Joe Hart. The handball from Ben Davies shows the corruption Celtic face. Any other club, and especially Rangers, would have got a stonewall penalty. Davis stopped the ball from going straight to two Celtic players directly in front of goal. VAR didn't even stop to look at it.\u201d And Richard Wharton, Carlisle, said: \u201cYou have to laugh at Philippe Clement greeting about the ref costing them the cup. This would be the same ref that failed to spot a deliberate first-half handball and a kick out at Alistair Johnston.\u201d With Abdallah Sima\u2019s goal chalked off, it was left to Adam Idah to win the cup for Celtic. And Stephen Mulhern, Dumbarton, said: \u201cOnce again Philippe Clement had his paper hankies out post match, claiming his side where the better team and refereeing decisions cost them the trophy. \"Granted Celtic weren\u2019t at there free flowing best in midfield but it seems the Ange Postecoqlou \u2018We never stop\u2019 mantra still exists at Celtic with Idah\u2019s last-minute strike. My message to Brendan Rodgers is get a \u00a36million bid in immediately as for me, Idah is a carbon copy of Moussa Dembele. We need to get in soon before a bidding war starts down south.\u201d Gerard Milligan, Renfrewshire, said: \u201cIt might be good for Celtic that Matt O\u2019Riley had his worst game in four months as any potential suitors would have closed their notebook long before the end, unless Celtic would rather have the \u00a325million!\u201d Gordon Hendry, Ochiltree, said: \u201cAs a Rangers fan, our manager and board have two immediate decisions to make. First, they have to sign Lawrence Shankland now before the Euros. And second they must sell Cyriel Dessers - anything else is a bonus.\u201d Barriemore Barlow, Dunbartonshire, added: \u201cClement has to clear the decks. There\u2019s no room for sentiment. He can't start his first full season with James Tavernier. Scott Wright has never been good enough while Nico Raskin, Tom Lawrence, Kieran Dowell and another eight need moved out.\u201d", "summary": "Andy Newport was on the Hotline as the curtain comes down on the domestic season and it was a lively one.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/rangers-fanatics-spit-hotline-venom-32895928", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32892397.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS334573031.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:15:23", "author": "Sports Hotline", "authors": ["Sports Hotline"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.023}

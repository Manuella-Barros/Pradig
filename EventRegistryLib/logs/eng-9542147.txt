David Trone, a white Democrat, knows the path to winning a Democratic nomination in Maryland goes through its Black voters.\n\n\"All of my elections, I've always done fantastic in minority areas, because so much of what I stand for is people who are left behind,\" said Trone, a three-term congressman from not far outside Washington, who became lavishly wealthy operating a national chain of discount liquor stores.\n\nThat wealth has allowed Trone to spend an eye-popping $57 million of his own money to try and trample his opponent in Maryland's Democratic U.S. Senate primary -- who happens to be a Black woman.\n\nThe May 14 contest between Trone, 68, and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks, 53, has put an uncomfortable spotlight on race for a party that prides itself on elevating women and people of color.\n\nAlsobrooks is overwhelmingly backed by the state's top Democrats, including Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Maryland's Black governor, Wes Moore, who called her a leader with \"vision and intention.\" But Trone, the founder of Total Wine & More, is spending boatloads to convince Maryland's diverse electorate (nearly a third of the state's population is Black) that he's the progressive outsider and underdog.\n\nTrone has argued that \"diversity is absolutely fantastic\" while also telling voters to \"leave color behind\" and choose the best candidate.\n\nThat pitch, delivered via more than two dozen unique TV ads, seems to be working, based on the very limited public polling of the primary. But it's still enough of a wild card that both candidates are sweating the outcome.\n\nTrone argues his money, which he made over the course of three decades as he grew Total Wine & More from a small family business, frees him from the pressures of special interests. And he's promised that if he wins the nomination, he'll continue to tap his fortune to fund his campaign against Republican Larry Hogan, the state's ultra-popular former Republican governor and the GOP's best shot at winning this seat.\n\n\"I think everybody who understands how politics works -- that money helps drive it -- realizes that having a candidate that can do an awful lot of self-funding is a big win,\" Trone told HuffPost last Thursday, after an event with a group of mostly Black seniors in Baltimore, the heart of the state's Black Democratic electorate.\n\nMany of the people behind Alsobrooks do not see it that way.\n\n\"I find it appalling and out of touch that I can watch a woman stand on stage last week and be so stateswoman-like, and you can have an individual looking at her saying he's the underdog,\" shouted Sydney Harrison, a Prince George's County council member, at a rally for Alsobrooks last Friday. \"How can a billionaire who spends 10-to-1 look at a woman of color and say he's the underdog?\"\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), the former House majority leader, told the same crowd: \"If you want to be for inclusion, if you want to make sure that all people are included in the United States Senate, you need to be for Angela Alsobrooks.\"\n\nAlsobrooks is running to be one of the few women of color ever elected to the U.S. Senate, where Black women are painfully underrepresented -- and the optics of a white man trying to stop her is making this primary especially ugly for Democrats in a state they can't afford to lose in November.\n\n\"I think we're all committed to dampening down the negativity, and preparing to support whoever wins with all we've got,\" insisted Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, another member of the Maryland congressional delegation behind Alsobrooks. \"This is really about the future of the country.\"\n\nThe 2024 election could give Democrats the opportunity to add not just one, but two Black women to the Senate next year. In Delaware, Lisa Blunt Rochester is likely to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Carper in November. But Alsobrooks, running to replace retiring Sen. Ben Cardin, would need to clear the primary against Trone and the general election against Hogan to join her. (A third Black female Senate candidate, Rep. Barbara Lee, finished fourth in California's March all-party primary behind a pair of white male candidates: Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff -- who is backing Trone -- and Schiff's GOP challenger.)\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Trone is arguing that race does not matter in his primary, though he's made several unforced errors underscoring why it does.\n\nLast month, Trone apologized for using what is widely known to be a racial slur during a congressional hearing, claiming he simply reached for the wrong word. At a debate a few days later, Trone cited Reps. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) and Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.), both of whom are Black, as \"great diversity candidates.\" And last week, Trone ignited a barrage of criticism after he referred to some Alsobrooks supporters as \"low-level folks.\"\n\n\"I didn't even know what the word meant,\" Trone told HuffPost, referring to the slur he used, instead of \"bugaboo,\" at the hearing. \"We made one word that was a mistake in a budget hearing and we apologized for it immediately.\"\n\nJoseline Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk, a Maryland state delegate backing Trone, said even though the slur incident troubled her at first, she believes Trone is a good person who's using his money to help Marylanders. \"You know, it does bother me,\" she said. \"But when I spoke with him, he apologized for it right away. He took ownership of it.\"\n\nThis week, Trone debuted his first attack ad against Alsobrooks, featuring several Black leaders from her county questioning whether she's qualified to be a senator.\n\n\"The U.S. Senate is not a place for training wheels,\" Edward Burroughs, a member of the Prince George's County council, says in an early cut of the ad, which was later reworked without this line. (Trone's campaign told HuffPost it found more compelling footage to replace it with.)\n\nBut Trone also describes Alsobrooks, who was elected state's attorney for Prince George's County in 2010 before becoming county executive in 2018, as a career politician, seemingly undercutting his argument that she has no political experience. \"Slowly, Angela, a state employee, state executive, county executive, just moved up the chain,\" he said.\n\nNone of this has helped Trone look any better to Alsobrooks' backers, who see a clumsy candidate forcing a lopsided primary.\n\n\"Money can't buy you love. He's using his wealth to elevate himself,\" said Cheryl Landis, a former Maryland state lawmaker.\n\n\"I'm thinking if I had $45 million, I would rather give that money to charity,\" Landis added, citing the amount of money that Trone was thought to have given his campaign just a week ago, before financial disclosures revealed he had dropped another $12 million. Alsobrooks, meanwhile, has raised nearly $8 million, throughout the primary.\n\nSeveral of the Black seniors who heard from Trone last week in Baltimore told HuffPost they didn't see anything wrong with Trone's massive degree of self-funding.\n\n\"He's been successful at the American dream, that's what we all want,\" said Sarah Holley, a 76-year-old who voted for Hogan once previously, but plans to vote for Trone in the primary and general election. \"How and why on earth would you try to find something wrong with the fact that he's done what we all want to do?\"\n\nSarah Matthews, a Black woman who founded a Baltimore-based advocacy group for older adults, said she isn't moved by Alsobrooks wanting to become the state's first Black female senator. \"Those sound like personal ambitions, and I'm not really interested in her personal ambitions.\"\n\nTrone, who has a raspy voice and gruff demeanor, ensured the Baltimore audience they can feel good about his spending because he's not an overnight success, having gradually expanding his family's wine and beer store into a 30-state chain after his family chicken farm went under. \"I'm a slow, slow success, and because I've been successful, I can use my finances to pay for this election,\" he said.\n\nTrone says he doesn't need the \"buck-175,\" or $174,000, annual salary that comes with being a congressman, and stresses he's focused as a lawmaker on mental health and substance use disorder treatment and prison reform. \"I don't care about the bullshit that goes with\" being in Congress and running campaigns, Trone told HuffPost, thumping his hand against a table for emphasis. \"I actually hate it.\"\n\nAlsobrooks, a young-looking Gen Xer who can quietly command a room, didn't mention Trone by name to the group of volunteers clad in neon green campaign tees at her rally last Friday. But his presence hung over the event.\n\n\"You know, there are some in this race who talk and it makes me so angry -- the more I heard about the pandering, the talk about second chances,\" said Alsobrooks, swiping at Trone's push to employ formerly incarcerated people at his liquor stores. \"I see all of us as people first.\"\n\nAlsobrooks told HuffPost that Trone's money advantage means she's had to work \"10 times as hard as him, but I'm accustomed to that.\"\n\nShe described her upbringing as the daughter of a receptionist and newspaper distributor in the same county where she's now the top elected official. \"I've never had it easy before,\" she said.\n\nThe Washington Post, in its endorsement of Alsobrooks over Trone for the nomination, lauded her stewardship of Prince George's during the pandemic and through public-safety emergencies, and her push for the FBI's new headquarters to be built in Greenbelt, Maryland. Those aspects of her record are also things she points to on the stump.\n\nIs Trone a racist, or something close to it, for his recent remarks and how he's running this race? Alsobrooks wouldn't go there. \"I think his language is reflective of his mindset. I mean, you heard him refer to very talented congresswomen as 'diversity candidates.' ... It's a reflection of how he feels about women candidates generally. And I think more specifically, some of the other language that he's used speaks for itself,\" she said.\n\nBelinda Lindsay, a 61-year-old college professor who showed up to see Alsobrooks last week, said Alsobrooks is \"hope\" and \"inspiration\" for a generation of Black women, though she knows the odds right now are against her.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

David Trone (D-Md.) rolled deep into his opponent's home turf Friday in Bowie, past a cardboard cutout of Prince George's County Executive Angela D. Alsobrooks's profile towering over a sea of campaign signs.\n\n\"Thank you, ma'am. Thank you for coming out,\" Trone said, welcoming the senior citizens arriving to an early voting site in the city's gymnasium. A campaign staffer retrieved a woman's collapsed walker and opened it, setting it on the sidewalk so that she could get to the polls.\n\nA day before, Alsobrooks (D) had line danced with supporters outside the same gym, noting the historic potential of her candidacy as early voting began in the most expensive political race in state history. The once-overlooked U.S. Senate contest catapulted to national prominence with the surprise entrance of a formidable Republican opponent, the popular former governor Larry Hogan.\n\nWhomever emerges victorious from the increasingly contentious primary battle on May 14 will carry the weight of protecting Maryland's reliably Democratic seat against an onslaught of spending from Republicans who recruited Hogan into what's now among a handful of races that could tip the balance of power in the Senate.\n\nWith days remaining to sway voters, the race is increasingly barbed.\n\nAttack ads have started to proliferate. Trone has already poured more than $54 million of his personal fortune into the race, outspending Alsobrooks 10-to-1 and saturating airwaves across the state for months.\n\nA political action committee called Women Vote put nearly $1.5 million starting Saturday behind an ad airing in Baltimore that criticizes Trone's business giving political contributions to Republicans who oppose abortion - a criticism Alsobrooks frequently leveled in forums. (Trone rebuts it with his high rating from Planned Parenthood and financial support of a western Maryland abortion clinic.) He was the first to go negative, airing ads last weekend with leaders from Prince George's who sided with him - and later editing it to remove a surrogate's comment that suggested Alsobrooks needed \"training wheels.\"\n\nThe pair top a crowded field and have few policy disagreements, offering Democratic voters a choice largely between identity and style - and the likelihood of beating Republicans in November.\n\n\"They both have great records, and they're both great people,\" voter Terry Dorsey, 67, of Nottingham, said outside a Baltimore County early voting center last week. But she \"wants to make sure the Democrats can maintain the majority\" and decided to cast a ballot for Trone because she thought \"he can beat Hogan.\"\n\nDiane Beal-Tydings, also 67, said outside Prince George's that having a Black woman in the Senate was critical and cast a vote for Alsobrooks, who is Black.\n\n\"Only we know what we go through,\" Beal-Tydings said. \"She's a role model for those young kids coming up because they can see: If she can do it, I can do it, too.\"\n\nAlsobrooks, who could be the first Black person that racially diverse Maryland sends to the Senate and the only woman in the congressional delegation, built an enviable battalion of the state's top Democrats. Trone, the multimillionaire owner of Total Wine & More who has shunned corporate donors and funded his own campaign, secured the backing of influential labor unions and many congressional colleagues, state leaders and Prince George's County officials. He built an early lead in polls before she went up on TV in earnest.\n\nIn recent days, Trone faced backlash for minimizing her supporters in an NBC 4 interview after characterizing Prince George's officials who endorsed Alsobrooks as \"low-level.\"\n\n\"By calling a majority of the County Council, seven of our eight State Senators, our State Treasurer, and a sitting member of the U.S. Congress 'low level people,' David Trone has insulted every man, woman, and child that calls Prince George's County home,\" six council members said in a statement Saturday morning. \"We may not be a billionaire liquor store owner like you, but you're going to find out that the nearly 1 million residents that call Prince George's County home will play a decisive role in electing our next U.S. Senator.\"\n\nStanding in the bed of a pickup truck Thursday outside the City of Bowie Gymnasium, Alsobrooks laid out the stakes of the race - a Martin Luther King Jr. mural to her left as supporters cheered and hoorahed.\n\n\"We do know that the majority in the Senate of the United States, keeping that in Democratic hands, could not be any more important than it is at this moment,\" she said, adding that the future of abortion access, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and democracy are on the line. So is representation, she noted.\n\n\"Half of the people who are here this evening don't have a voice in our delegation,\" she said. \"We have 10 people in our delegation who are extremely talented, and all 10 are men. We do not have a single woman. ... Every single one of us here ought to be able to see ourselves in the Senate.\"\n\nMichaela Graham, a 23-year-old second-grade teacher from Bowie, cast a vote for Alsobrooks and said an endorsement from veteran Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) assured her that the county executive was a solid choice. A scholarship program Hoyer championed has helped Graham reduce her student loans, she said.\n\nThe next day, Trone was a little further north, outside the Beltsville Senior Activity Center in Laurel, Md., giving interviews and talking about how Hogan is \"the elephant in the room.\"\n\n\"Voters want to hear about message: What do you stand for? That's what we've been trying to talk about,\" he said, rattling off education, addiction and mental health among his top issues. \"We cannot let Maryland be the reason we lose the United States Senate.\"\n\nGabriel Njinimb0t, a Democrat originally from Cameroon challenging incumbent Rep. Glenn Ivey (D), who endorsed Alsbrooks, parked his campaign truck and walked over to Trone. \"I think you got this,\" he said. Trone launched into an explanation of how much outreach his team had done into the African diaspora community and other often-overlooked constituencies, then spotted cars pulling in the far entrance and called out to a volunteer.\n\n\"Is someone over there grabbing them coming in that way?\" he asked. \"We've got to make sure we got every line of fire covered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Democrats' presumed Republican opponent, Hogan, hosted hundreds at a fundraiser and rally at a Davidsonville, Md., farm Saturday afternoon. His campaign bus with the slogan \"Send a message to Washington!\" was parked beside a barn as a live band and open bar greeted supporters.\n\nHogan took the stage, bopping his microphone in time with the lyrics to \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" before launching into a stump speech about how his wife, Yumi, told him he'd regret not stepping up when he thinks he could make a difference - and that he's so fed up with politics that he's yelling at the TV at home.\n\n\"I'm walking around the crowd, and some of you are saying, 'Wow, I had no idea you were running for United States Senate,'\" he said to laughs, then deadpanned: \"I had no idea either.\"\n\nIn an interview afterward, Hogan declined to say who he'd rather face in November.\n\n\"Look, I'm not running against either of those two potential candidates,\" Hogan said. \"I'm running against the broken politics and the system in Washington. I'm not running for one party or against one party. It doesn't matter to me who the candidate is - we're going to make the case and go out and talk about the issues.\"\n\nEarly voters Judy Taylor and her husband, David, both 74, said their biggest concern this cycle is ensuring democracy survives.\n\n\"We need politicians who obey the rules of the laws of the country,\" David Taylor said Thursday outside the Randallstown Community Center in Baltimore County. His wife agreed, particularly in the presidential contest. \"I think our democracy is at risk, and I want some who will abide by the Constitution,\" she said.\n\nThe couple, both registered Democrats, said they would vote for Trone in the primary because they like his voting record in Congress and said his views are in line with theirs. But both said they might vote for Hogan in November.\n\n\"I would vote for him because of his record in the state,\" David Taylor said. \"He was a really good governor.\" Judy Taylor said she likes Hogan and would also \"probably\" vote for him but is hesitant. She said she doesn't want Republicans to gain control of the Senate.", "source": {"uri": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp", "dataType": "news", "title": "japannews.yomiuri.co.jp"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Larry Hogan\n\nA heated Democratic primary contest for U.S. Senate is raising concerns about the potential for a fractured party heading into the general elections in November, when the winner is almost certain to face popular former Gov. Larry Hogan (R).\n\nU.S. Rep. David Trone (D-6th) and Prince George's Couty Executive Angela Alsobrooks (D) are locked in a pitch battle atop a field of eight other candidates for the Democratic nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Ben Cardin (D). Both sides are pointing at their opponent, blaming the other for what they said is bitter campaign rhetoric. But as the campaigns head into the final week of early voting before the May 14 election day, state Treasurer Dereck Davis (D) says Trone's words threaten to divide the party headed into November.\n\n\"I think folks will unify to the degree that we can but words do matter,\" said Davis, who has endorsed Alsobrooks. \"The more divisive the rhetoric, the more personal it gets, the longer it takes for that healing process to occur. And Larry Hogan is no joke. He is going to be one heck of a candidate. As soon as the party is able to unify behind the winner and run united, I think the greater our chances are. But this tone that's taking place, this level of discourse is taking place, it's going to require more healing.\"\n\nOf particular concern to Davis was a recent television news report featuring both candidates.\n\nTrone, in that interview on NBC 4 in Washington, made a comment Davis said was dismissive of the lengthy list of officials from Prince George's County who endorsed Alsobrooks.\n\n\"People that know the county best, ironically, all came to us,\" Trone said in the interview that aired Wednesday. \"The people in Prince George's County that stuck with [Alsobrooks] are the low-level folks. Top-level folks: that's called the attorney general, I think. I think that's called the state's attorney. I think that's called the senior senator. I think they're the top-level folks.\"\n\nTrone was referring to three of his backers: Attorney General Anthony Brown (D), Prince George's State's Attorney Aisha Braveboy (D), and state Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George's).\n\nDavis said Trone's rhetoric in that interview and in other instances \"really wreaked havoc in our county.\"\n\n\"It's fine for elected officials to support whomever they deem is the best choice,\" Davis said. \"I don't have any problem with that and if it's not Angela, you know, so be it. They're entitled to their opinion. But when we start demeaning, or belittling the accomplishments of others, I think that crosses the line and that's where you start getting elected official against the executive official, the community against each other. That that's just not warranted.\"\n\nA Trone spokesperson, Joe Bowen, said Trone grew frustrated during the TV interview because Prince George's County officials who have endorsed him have been diminished by Alsobrooks allies because they've taken campaign contributions from Trone.\n\n\"He made that point very badly,\" Bowen conceded.\n\n\"He's apologetic about that but the facts are the facts,\" Bowen continued. \"Angela has been in elected office in Prince George's County since 2015. She was endorsed by the vast majority of the legislators, but the folks who have served Prince George's the longest, who served our state the longest, who know her the best have endorsed David Trone. I think that the things that those elected officials have to say deserve to be heard. And I think the voters also deserve to understand why they chose to make those decisions. And in that interview, David was frustrated that that part of the question never seems to come up.\"\n\nTrone supporters including, House Health and Government Operations Chair Joseline A. Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk (D-Prince George's and Anne Arundel), dismissed concerns that the Democratic primary will divide the party in November.\n\n\"Let's focus on the issues,\" said Pe\u00f1a-Melnyk. \"There's too much at stake: women's [reproductive] choice health care, the economy, immigration. Let's focus on the issues. And I hope that after we are done, whoever wins, that we can all come together, and we can work hard to fight to make sure that Hogan does not get elected.\"\n\nPe\u00f1a-Melnyk said Democrats need to avoid what she called the mistakes of the recent past when Brown, who was then the lieutenant governor, lost the 2014 race for governor to Hogan, the Republican.\n\n\"That's what matters,\" she said. \"We cannot make the mistake again because we've been here before with Anthony Brown, where some people were never truly on board afterwards. We cannot make that mistake. We can't afford to do that again.\"\n\nThis is the second time in a week that allies of Alsobrooks have publicly criticized Trone over commercials or interviews.\n\nEarlier this week, Alsobrooks supporters took umbrage with Trone over an ad they said portrayed Alsobrooks was unqualified for the Senate.\n\nThe TV spot features a lineup of current and former elected officials from Prince George's County. All those featured had already endorsed Trone.\n\nThe otherwise innocuous campaign ad got spicy when County Councilmember Edward Burroughs III (D) says: \"The U.S. Senate is not a place for training wheels.\"\n\nNearly two-dozen Alsobrooks supporters, in a news conference organized by Prince George's County Council President Jolene Ivey (D), blasted Trone for the swipe.\n\n\"It is frustrating that Congressman Trone is using his millions to attack Angela and continues to make remarks that alienate core constituencies of our Democratic base,\" said Gina Ford, a spokesperson for the Alsobrooks campaign. \"Angela continues to prove with every passing day that she is the only candidate who can defeat Larry Hogan in November -- she has the broad coalition, the uplifting message, and the disciplined focus on the issues that matter most to Marylanders. Elections are about the future, and Angela is the only candidate speaking to that.\"\n\nThe ad has since been re-cut, eliminating the \"training wheels\" comment and replacing it with additional footage of Benson and correcting an error in the ad pertaining to Trone's work in Congress.\n\n\"Our team noticed a typographical error in the number of bills that David has passed through Congress,\" according to a statement released by the Trone campaign. \"While fixing that error, our editors found additional footage of our endorsers that they found compelling and chose to make a number of additional edits. All of the changes were made Friday evening, prior to the original ad being released.\"\n\nDespite the edit, Trone used a similar phrase during the May 1 NBC 4 television interview.\n\n\"This job is not for someone on training wheels,\" Trone said in the interview. \"This job is really for someone that's really been doing the work and understands the relationships.\"\n\nTo Davis, Trone's words ring of self-criticism.\n\n\"The irony is he and some of his advocates mentioned training wheels,\" Davis said. \"The congressman has only been there five years. I mean, he's not a grizzled veteran. And if you look at the irony of the statement, the House of Representatives is a co-equal branch to the Senate. And yet when he ran six years ago, for Congress, he had zero experience. Now after six years or coming up on six years, you're in a position to talk about someone else needing training wheels?\"\n\nDavis said it is another example of Trone putting his foot in his mouth and noted Trone's inadvertent use of a racial slur during a House budget hearing.\n\nIn March, Trone issued an apology after using the derogatory term, saying he mistakenly used the word having meant to say \"bugaboo.\" Only afterwards did he learn the verbal miscue was offensive to Blacks, he said in his apology.\n\n\"I think his own experience is showing in his own sort of lack of deft political touch,\" Davis said.\n\nIn a statement, Bowen, the Trone spokesperson, said the criticisms are a diversion.\n\n\"The elected leaders featured in this ad endorsed David Trone because they know that he is the only candidate focused on putting people over politics and delivering real results for their communities,\" he said.\n\n\"While David has focused on the ways that Washington is broken and proposed bold ideas that can fix Washington, our opponents and their supporters have fixated on which politicians have what status. Elected leaders like Attorney General Anthony Brown, State Senator Joanne Benson, Chairwoman Joseline Pena-Melnyk and State's Attorney Aisha Braveboy have worked closely with David for years, and they endorsed David for the United States Senate because they know he will beat Larry Hogan because David Trone is the most effective legislator in Maryland's federal delegation, and Marylanders want a Senator who can get the job done in a divided Senate.\"", "source": {"uri": "moco360.media", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoCo360"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maryland_matters@moco360.media", "name": "Maryland Matters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "bryan_p_sears@moco360.media", "name": "Bryan P.

David Trone of Potomac continues to pour his personal fortune into his candidacy for a Senate seat-writing his campaign a check for another $3.15 million last week, according to a new disclosure filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nThe most recent comprehensive report filed by the Trone campaign, covering the period from April 1 to 24, had shown Trone directing $54.12 million in personal funds to his campaign since announcing his candidacy a year ago to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Baltimore).\n\nHowever, in a subsequent disclosure form published on the FEC website late last week, Trone-who has vowed to spend \"what it takes\" to win the race-revealed he had added the $3.15 million on April 29. It brings the total amount of his self-funding to $57.25 million in his bid for the Democratic nomination against Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks.\n\nThe disclosure came in a so-called 48-hour report: Although Alsobrooks and Trone will not be required to file their next comprehensive campaign finance reports with the FEC until a couple of months after next week's primary, federal election law mandates that-between April 25 and May 11, three days before the primary-they must disclose contributions of $1,000 or more to their campaigns within 48 hours of receipt.\n\nThe latest self-donation by Trone-founder and co-owner of Total Wine & More, a nationwide chain of alcohol beverage outlets-brings him closer to the all-time record for a self-funding Senate candidate: $63.57 million, set by now-Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott in his 2018 race. However, Scott's funding covered both the primary and general election that year, while Trone has spent nearly that much in the primary alone. And Scott's level of spending came in a state with a population well over three times that of Maryland.\n\nThe FEC pre-primary report covering three and a half weeks in April showed Trone spending $9.77 million in that stretch alone-$4 million more than the total of $5.72 million in spending by Alsobrooks since she announced in May 2023. All told, Trone reported spending close to $51.7 million in the course of the campaign as of the April 24 cutoff for the pre-primary report, with nearly three weeks to go until Primary Day.\n\nThe financial gap between the two leading contenders for the Democratic nomination is underscored by an examination of what they have reported spending on efforts to get their names and messages out to the primary electorate, who are now going to the polls during early voting as well as casting mail ballots. Early voting ends Thursday.\n\nDuring just the April period covered by recent pre-primary report, Trone spent nearly $6 million on television advertising-including $5.67 million to buy time on over-the-air and cable TV channels, as well as $313,000 paid to Siegel Strategies, the New York-based media production firm that Trone regularly uses.\n\nTrone-whose lead in recent independent polling is widely attributed to his visibility from the statewide TV blitz that he launched last fall and has kept on the air since-also spent more than $9.2 million on television in the first three months of 2024, with another $6.7 million coming earlier, during the final quarter of 2023. All told, his campaign reported spending nearly $22 million on TV advertising as of late April-translating into more than 40% of total campaign expenditures to date.\n\nAlsobrooks did not begin advertising until mid-February on Baltimore television stations, and her TV ad campaign did not reach the pricier Washington, D.C., market until last month. Recent FEC reports indicate that she has spent a total of approximately $2.5 million to air TV ads-slightly more than 10% of the amount spent by Trone, with $1.62 million of Alsobrooks' spending coming in April, on top of about $865,000 during the first quarter of the year. Those figures don't include another $125,000 for media production with the Alexandria, Va.-based firm of Magnus Pearson.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trone campaign reported spending about $1.35 million in April with two firms- Washington, D.C.-based Gambit Strategies and Liftoff Campaigns in Silver Spring -- for digital advertising and related consulting services. It spent more than $4.7 million in this category during the first quarter of the year, for a total of $6 million since Jan. 1.\n\nIn contrast, the Alsobrooks campaign spent about $200,000 on virtual outreach during this period with two D.C.-based firms, BreakSomething and Wavelength Strategy. About $165,000 in expenditures on online ads, text messaging and digital consulting were reported in the report filed for the first quarter of 2024, with another $40,000 spent for this purpose in April.\n\nThe disparity in the two campaigns' direct mail effort was equally striking. The only direct mail expenditure reported by the Alsobrooks campaign since the beginning of the year was a $22,400 payment to EMILY's List, a political action committee that has endorsed Alsobrooks.\n\nEMILY's List-which backs Democratic women candidates who support abortion rights-has repeatedly criticized Trone and his company for past donations to Republican candidates opposed to abortion in states where Total Wine & More has done business.\n\nThe Trone campaign has paid more than $1.23 million since Jan. 1 to the Philadelphia-area direct mail firm of AMS Communications. During this period, more than a dozen glossy fliers have been targeted to Democratic voters-the latest of which landed in mailboxes this weekend and reflects the increasingly sharp tone of the Alsobrooks-Trone race in recent weeks.\n\n\"Trone Will Beat Larry Hogan, Alsobrooks Will Lose,\" the headline of the flier declares, alluding to popular former Gov. Larry Hogan-who is expected to emerge from the May 14 primary with the Republican nomination.\n\nWhile Trone appears to have a continuing ability to write checks to himself-as illustrated by last week's additional $3.15 million-the Alsobrooks campaign, which has relied entirely on outside donors, could face financial challenges in the closing days of the primary contest.\n\nUnder federal election law and subsequent court decisions, Trone and other self-funding candidates can spend as much as they choose on their own campaigns-but outside individual donors and advocacy groups are limited in what they can contribute to a candidate's campaign committee. At present, the inflation-indexed limit for individual donors is $3,300 per election.\n\nHowever, a significant number of individual donors to Alsobrooks have \"maxed out\"-giving more than the $3,300 limit, with some contributing the $6,600 maximum that an outside individual is permitted to donate during an entire election cycle, including both the primary and general election. Candidates such as Alsobrooks are allowed to keep contributions in excess of $3,300 up to the $6,600 maximum, but donations in this category must be cordoned off and can be used only if she wins the primary and advances to the general election.\n\nSuch \"maxed out\" contributions accounted for only about 4% (about $26,700) of the receipts that the Alsobrooks campaign reported in April, but represented closer to 9% (approximately $188,000) of what was taken in during the first quarter of the year. These donations comprised an even larger percentage of what Alsobrooks raised in 2023, totaling $713,000 over nearly eight months.\n\nAll told, these general election-only funds, totaling $927,000, appear to represent close to half of the $1.91 million that the Alsobrooks campaign reported having in its treasury as of April 24-leaving the campaign to rely on the remaining approximately $1 million in available funds, and whatever additional donations it can raise in the campaign's homestretch.", "source": {"uri": "moco360.media", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoCo360"}, "authors":

David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks are vying for the Democratic nomination to succeed longtime U.S. Sen Ben Cardin.\n\nNormally, the May 14 primary winner would be on a glide path to the U.S. Senate in a blue state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1.\n\nBut these are not normal political times.\n\nThe victor of the Democratic primary is expected to face popular former Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, a formidable fundraiser who was elected to two terms in Annapolis.\n\nIn addition to what is shaping up as the most competitive U.S. Senate race in Maryland in decades, the contest has national implications for Washington Republicans seeking to regain control of the upper chamber.\n\n\"The stakes are very high because the Democrats have a tiny majority in the Senate,\" said David Karol, associate professor at the University of Maryland's Department of Government and Politics.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult for them to retain the majority as it is, and if they were to lose this seat in Maryland, I don't see how they could conceivably retain the majority. So, there's a lot at stake here for national politics in a way that's very unusual for a Maryland Senate race.\"\n\nTrone has now spent well over $50 million of his own money on his U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nNo candidate in Maryland has ever spent anything close to that kind of money on a political seat -- not even close. In the 2016 Democratic Senate primary between now-U. S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and former congresswoman Donna Edwards, the total was closer to $15 million.\n\nAlsobrooks has criticized Trone for spending so much money, but the congressman has made no apologies for dipping into his personal fortune.\n\nTrone, the founder of Total Beverage & More, said he's willing to spend whatever it takes -- not just to beat Alsobrooks, but because he believes he's the only one with the resources to defeat Hogan in the general election.\n\nCampaign funding is the largest difference between the two candidates. Alsobrooks has raised just under $8 million for her campaign -- a significant amount -- but only a fraction of Trone's war chest.\n\nOn the issues, there is little daylight between the two, with each staking out similar Democratic positions on a host of issues.\n\nWhile Trone would have spent a lot of money on his campaign regardless, the late entry of Hogan into the race has clearly changed the dynamic on the Democratic side.\n\nKarol said when Trone and Alsobrooks got into the race, they didn't expect to face \"a serious Republican opponent.\" As he pointed out, Maryland has not elected a Republican Senator in more than 40 years -- since U.S. Sen. Charles Mathias was reelected in 1980.\n\n\"I think they were blindsided by this,\" Karol said. \"And now electability does become an important concern, especially when you take into account the fact that there is not a big divide on the issues between Mr. Trone and Ms. Alsobrooks.\"\n\nHogan had been on the record saying he had no interest in getting elected to the Senate before he decided to jump into the race in February.\n\nGiven Hogan's formidable political chops, Democrats have been reconsidering their primary.\n\nKarol said it is reasonable for many Democratic voters to ask themselves, \"OK, well, which one of them can guarantee victory?\"\n\nIt's no secret that the Senate's top Republican, Mitch McConnell, thought some of the GOP Senate candidates in 2022 were lackluster.\n\nBut Republicans have a favorable map for regaining control of the Senate this fall and getting Hogan to run in Maryland was a big political coup for U.S. Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.), head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\nDaines is the GOP point man for getting Republicans elected to the Senate.\n\n\"I think it's a huge windfall for Republicans,\" Karol said of Hogan's candidacy.\n\nKarol points out that with U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin not seeking reelection in West Virginia, Democrats have effectively lost his Democratic seat in a state that's very red.\n\nSo Republicans could regain control of the Senate by picking up just that seat if former President Donald Trump is reelected since they would have a 50-50 tie.\n\nEven if President Biden is reelected, Republicans only need to pick up an additional seat, to get to 51-49. And Democratic incumbents face tough Senate races in Montana and Ohio, among other states.\n\n\"So Democrats were in trouble and facing a big challenge to hold the Senate before they got the news that the Maryland race was going to be one that they had to really fight to hold the seat -- and they didn't expect that,\" Karol said.\n\nSo, Maryland is going to be in the national political spotlight.\n\nMcConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, recently told Politico that Maryland is in the mix of four states where the GOP is going to be in play.\n\nBut first things first -- voters will decide on a Democratic nominee for the Senate on March 14, as well as the Republican nominee.\n\nGet breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n\n\u00a9 2024 WTOP.

(WBFF) -- Maryland's U.S. Senate candidates rallied with supporters Saturday as early voting gets underway in what could be one of the most consequential elections of the 2024 season.\n\nPrince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks kicked off her day with a lively rally outside of her Silver Spring campaign headquarters with Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nIt's a great day to be fighting for Angela Alsobrooks,\" Raskin said to a crowd of supporters. \"What an amazing day.\"\n\nRaskin surprised Alsobrooks with a beaded necklace made by a California artist. The congressman told his supporters that the balance of power in the Senate could depend on the decisions made by Marylanders during the primary election.\n\nDuring his speech, Rep. Raskin pointed to a blue bead on a necklace that resembled the Senate's seating arrangement. He mentioned that this bead represented Alsobrooks winning the seat for Democrats.\n\nThis blue bead right here is Angela Alsobrooks giving us 51 seats in the U.S. Senate,\" Rep. Raskin said.\n\nDuring an interview with FOX45 News following the rally, Alsobrooks said she was excited to see strong support on a Saturday.\n\nFOX45 News asked Alsobrooks about a new Federal Election Commission (FEC) supplemental report filed by her chief Democratic primary opponent, Rep. David Trone, D-Md., revealing he made an additional $3.1 million personal loan to his campaign on April 29.\n\n\"This race will be won by people, as it should be,\" Alsobrooks said. \"Nobody should be allowed to buy a race.\"\n\nBefore the latest infusion, Trone had already loaned his campaign $54.1 million, federal filings show. Trone's filings showed he had spent nearly as much as he had invested during the FEC reporting periods from April 1 to April 24.\n\n$57 million in an effort to buy a race,\" Alsobrooks said. \"Marylanders are savvy, they will decide on experience.\"\n\nRequests on Friday and Saturday for Trone's weekend campaign schedule were not returned.\n\nFormer Governor Larry Hogan made his case to a packed crowd at a Davidsonville farm on Saturday afternoon, speaking under a barn overhang.\n\nWhile speaking to hundreds of attendees amidst heavy rain pounding on the muddy field, Hogan criticized the idea that his race was a partisan battle for Senate control.\n\n\"This is not about the differences between the left and the right.

Well, Dan Cox has decided to chide us if we compare Kristi Noem's Cricket murder to \"Old Yeller style self-made American ranch life\".\n\nWe are eight days away from the Maryland Primary. The nine major Federal Races taking on across the state are all taking varied paths to the General Election. Lakes take a look.\n\nU.S. Senate\n\nAll of the action is on the Democratic side, where Congressman David Trone and Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks are in knock-down, drag-out fight that is emblematic of the usual struggles when a Senate seat comes open in Maryland.\n\nFrom the outside, it's hard to get a read on who the victor is going to be. The gloves have been off for a while, as David Trone poached a ton of Prince George's County Elected officials to endorse him. In turn, Alsobrooks supporters have accused Trone of buying off those who have endorsed him. Susan Turnbull, who knows a thing or two about losing statewide, among them.\n\nAlso at issue is the fact that a Trone ad implied that Alsbrooks didn't have enough experience to be in the U.S. Senate. The Alsobrooks campaign took umbrage with that, saying that Trone had only five years of Congressional experience. But Alsobrooks has never served in any legislative body and has never served on a federal level, so he has a point.\n\nAs Democratic primaries often do, things become an issue of race, insider status, and nonsense. I said from the beginning that it was Alsobrooks' primary to lose. From what I have seen, she just might lose it after all.\n\nOn the Republican side, Larry Hogan is going to win. I acknowledge that that Robin Ficker, the Washington Generals of running for office in Maryland, has run a surprisingly disciplined and professional-looking campaign. None of this changes the fact that he is Robin Ficker and has practically no base of support.\n\nThe most surprising thing here is that, on a recent trip to the Eastern Shore, I saw exponentially more signs for Republican challenger Chris Bruneau than Id did incumbent Andy Harris. That, of course, will have no bearing on the crushing Harris primary victory he's about to win.\n\nI can't name the Democratic candidate off the top of my head and you can't either.\n\n2nd Congressional District\n\nRemember when Kimberly Klacik was national news back in 2020 when she ran that hopeless campaign in the 7th Congressional District and the right fawned over her like she had a chance to win? Yeah, those days might as well be a thousand years ago because nobody cares about Klacik or her campaign anymore.\n\nAfter the primary, either Klacik, John Thormann, or Dave Wallace will lose to Congressman-presumptive Johnny O.\n\n3rd Congressional District\n\nThere are still 22 candidates in the Democratic primary alone. I said that this was State Senator Sarah Elfreth's race back when it started. I no longer think that anymore. This is a two-person race, between Elfreth and former Capital Police Officer Harry Dunn. Dunn has become the favorite of the national Democratic crowd, which certainly chaps the ass of Maryland's Democratic establishment that likes to stage manage this stuff so people can keep getting promoted up the chain.\n\nAll that being said, the margin of victory is going to be razor thin in this race. Dunn and Elfreth have gotten most of the publicity. Delegate Terry Hill, State Senator Clarence Lam, and Delegate Mike Rogers have their constituencies in their communities. And Delegate Mark Change is trying the desperate Hail Mary pass of a humorous TV ad.\n\nUltimately, I think the race will end up with Dunn edging Elfreth, with Chang in third.\n\nThe only drama here is to see how badly Mckayla Wilkes loses this time. Steny Hoyer beat her by 37% in 2020 and 52% in 2022. So there is no real reason to think she isn't going to get blown out by a bigger margin this time.\n\n6th Congressional District\n\nThe Democratic primary is a mess of people running just to lose to April McLain Delaney. Literally nothing of note has come out of this primary.\n\nOn the Republican side, it's a three-candidate race between Tom Royals, former Delegate Dan Cox, and Delegate Neil Parrott, though occasionally Muslim Chaplain Chris Hyser pops up to say bonkers stuff, like trying to churn up anti-Israeli sentiment by misquoting old news stories to attack Jewish leaders.\n\nTom Royals was endorsed by the Washington Post, though that tends to be the kiss of death in the 6th District Republican primary. That being said, Royals has been raising money and has been working the rounds in the district.\n\nNeil Parrott has been slow and steady in the race. He was the last candidate into the race back at the filing deadline and has been building upon his previous two Republican primary wins for Congress in this district.\n\nDan Cox has, surprisingly, run a reasonably sane campaign compared to his disastrous 2022 run for Governor. Of course, that doesn't absolve him from his paranoid, late Friday night slurred rant about \"Joe Biden sending Blackhawks\" after him.\n\nSo who wins the primary? I have absolutely no idea. I said from the beginning that Cox was the candidate to beat. I don't think he is the favorite at this point. I don't know who is, but name ID may not carry Cox as far as I once thought. What I do know is that if Republicans want any chance to win this seat in November they cannot nominate Cox.\n\n7th and 8th Congressional Districts\n\nWe'll know how right I was in eight days, when the Senate primary moves into the heavyweight fight between Hogan and the Democratic nominee.

Trone also called the Prince Georgians who endorse Alsobrooks, a list which includes two members of Congress and 7 of 8 state senators, \"low-level\" officials.\n\nIn response to Trone's comment, Moore fired back, saying, \"I'm looking at these remarkable public servants people who have sacrificed and asked their families to sacrifice.

This week she stepped back into the political arena to announce her support for Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks in her bid for Maryland's open U.S. Senate seat.\n\n\"Now we have the opportunity to send another woman back to the United States Senate from Maryland,\" Mikulski, D-Md., said in a release from the Alsobrooks' campaign, \"because, for Angela, it's not only about gender, it's about the agenda. She's got the right stuff.\"\n\nMikulski is the only woman to ever represent Maryland in the U.S. Senate. Sixty women have served in the Senate in the country's history, with 25 serving at this time. Since Mikulski stepped away in 2017, the 10-member Maryland congressional delegation has been all male.\n\nAt last reporting in mid-April, U.S. Rep. David Trone, D-6th, had loaned or guaranteed his campaign $41.7 million. This week, a new form from the Federal Election Commission shows he contributed $3.1 million more on April 29.\n\nMore: US Senate campaigns release campaign finance reports. Here's a deep dive into the numbers.\n\nThe contribution comes days after the release of an ad that emphasizes the support of his campaign from four elected officials and a former elected official from Prince George's County, while critiquing his opponent, Angela Alsobrooks, the county's current county executive.\n\nPrince George's state's attorney, a state senator and a pair of current council members spoke in the ad. The majority of the current 11-member council in that county has endorsed Alsobrooks.\n\nFormer Gov. Larry Hogan received the backing of a previous candidate for Maryland's open U.S. Senate seat in February. This week, Hogan's campaign announced Retired U.S. Air Force Brig. Gen. John Teichert would be chairing a \"campaign coalition\" on his behalf.\n\nTeichert, who campaigned as a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat, was announced in a Hogan campaign news release as the chair of the \"Veterans for Hogan\" coalition, which includes veterans from each of Maryland's jurisdictions.\n\nHogan's announcement coincided with the start of the primary's early voting period, which began last week and continues through Thursday.\n\n-- Dwight A.

It's our chance to make our voices heard,\" said the governor while smiling broadly.\n\nWith early voting across Maryland seeing low turnout with fewer than 54,000 votes cast halfway through the eighth day early voting period, Moore and DeMarinis hope to energize the electorate amid a clear shift in voter preferences.\n\n\"Mail-in is a new form of voting that is here to stay. A lot of people availed themselves of mail-in voting. We have 620,000 requests so far, we've mailed out over 583,000 ballots and we received over 220,000 so far,\" DeMarinis said.\n\nREAD | Early voting kicks off for Maryland Primary with shift toward mail-in ballots\n\nAfter recording that message and voting alongside his wife Dawn at their new polling place in Annapolis, Moore then shifted gears to politics. He joined supporters of Prince George's County Executive Angela Alsobrooks to reiterate his endorsement of Alsobrooks's candidacy for the United States Senate.\n\n\"I see the mettle of people when times are tough. I have seen her lead in difficult times. I have seen her lead during covid I have seen her lead when negotiations are difficult for multiple parties,\" Moore said. \"And I think she has not just integrity but also a grace that our state deserves.\"\n\nAlsobrooks is battling Representative David Trone for the Democratic nomination. The winner is likely to face Republican former Governor Larry Hogan in the fall.\n\nREAD | Three open Congressional seats draw dozens of candidates in Maryland's heated race\n\nTrone spent around $54,000,000 of his money airing ads, including several that feature endorsements from Prince George's current and former elected officials. The ads have recently taken an aggressive tone toward Alsobrooks. Trone also called the Prince Georgians who endorse Alsobrooks, a list which includes two members of Congress and 7 of 8 state senators, \"low-level\" officials.\n\nIn response to Trone's comment, Moore fired back, saying, \"I'm looking at these remarkable public servants people who have sacrificed and asked their families to sacrifice.

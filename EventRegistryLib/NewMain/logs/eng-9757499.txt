These investments are empowering our young people with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century.\n\n\"Let me also acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the Governor of Lagos State, who has consistently demonstrated a commitment to the student constituency.

It is an all-inclusive government, and the President is determined to ensure that no one is left behind in this attempt to march Nigeria towards progress,\" Idris said.\n\n...Count us out, says NANS\n\nAnd in a related development, the Lagos axis of NANS Tuesday vowed to shun any form of protest that may disturb the peace and stability of the state and the nation at large.\n\nAddressing a World Press Conference in Lagos, chairman, NANS, Lagos axis, Comrade Alimi Lekan Idris, said in the current difficult situation, the students' body recognises the importance of peace, stability and constructive dialogue in achieving their collective goal, hence the need to eschew violence.\n\nStating the significant contributions and progress that had been witnessed in the state, the NANS leader said: \"We are not in support of any protests against the government of Lagos.\"\n\nAs a demonstration of the students' support for the Lagos state government, as well as their commitment to peace and stability, Idris said, \"NANS Lagos axis would hold a solidarity walk in support of the state government from August I to 10, to coincidence with the proposed dates of a planned protests by some unknown individuals.\"\n\nThe body said it understood the frustrations and challenges being faced by many people, adding, \"we must all recognise the advancements and opportunities that have been provided to cushion the economic effect on the nation.\"\n\nIdris, therefore, urged other states' governments to emulate Lagos in that regard.\n\nHe said the students' body cannot afford to allow the destructive events, such as EndSARS, to repeat themselves.\n\nThe NANS leader added: \"Our priority is to defend and preserve the peace and prosperity of Lagos.\"\n\nHe urged all students to channel their energies into constructive dialogue and positive actions, such as volunteering for community development projects, participating in student-government initiatives, as well as engaging in academic and extra-curricular activities that promote academic excellence.\n\nHe expressed the belief that \"with time and patience and continued collaboration with the government,\" they would see further improvements and solutions to the issues that face them currently.\n\n\"Let us stand together in unity and purpose, ensuring that our actions reflect our commitment to a better future for all,\" Idris charged the students.\n\n...APC weighs in\n\nAnd in all of this, the All Progressives Congress (APC) asked Nigerians to hold the state governors accountable for the present hardship being faced in the country.\n\nThe party also accused some individuals it described as failed politicians as being the brain behind the planned protest.\n\nAddressing newsmen at the APC National Secretariat Tuesday in Abuja, the Rivers state caretaker committee chairman of the party, Tony Okocha, who admitted that times were hard globally, exonerated President Tinubu as being responsible for the current situation in the country.\n\nOkocha said people should ask their state governors questions on how they were managing the huge allocation accruing to the states.\n\n\"The truth be told. Let us face reality here. What is the reason for the plan protest? The reason for the planned protest as I heard is that there is hunger in the land. Is President Tinubu the architect of hunger in the land? Why are we not demonstrating and protesting against our governors?\n\n\"In my time as the Chief of Staff, we had allocation to the tune of N6.6billion monthly. That was the maximum we got. But Rivers State today is coasting home to more than N28 billion from federal allocation. So, what happens?\n\n\"The removal of fuel subsidy brought in money to the system. And the President didn't put the money in his pocket. He is giving out. When these money are given to the states, do they think the President should also come and administer its use?,\" he queried.\n\nHe said: \"As a party in Rivers state and patriotic citizens of Nigeria, we would like to seize this opportunity to caution against the planned protest by people I call failed politicians.\n\n\"They cannot destroy the APC or the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. We should support the President as he is determined to move Nigeria forward. It will take time, but the process is in place.\n\n\"We should not compare Nigeria to Kenya or Sudan. The circumstances and indices are different, and our population cannot be compared to those countries. Encouraging protests will only lead to chaos. We advise Nigerians not to join or support what I call failed politicians who think they can destroy the APC or the President.\"\n\n...Protest political gimmick, says Wike\n\nIn a similar response, FCT Minister Nyesom Wike described the planned nationwide protest as political.\n\nThe minister said this Tuesday during an interview with journalists after inspecting the Apo-Karshi Road project, awarded some 13 years ago (2011).\n\nHe said: \"The country was rotten, you know that the country was rotten, and then a government has just come to see what it can do, at least to move from where we are to a certain level. And you say that a miracle must be performed within one year?\n\n\"You are here now; we were talking about a contract that was awarded 13 good years ago. What has happened? Nothing. And now a government has come, to say we will fix all these things and we are too much in a haste that it must be done now. That is not possible; the protest is political,\" said the minister.\n\nHe also threw tantrums at those he called political jobbers seeking relevance ahead of the 2027 elections.\n\nThe minister said: \"Everyone is not happy that there is hunger, everyone is not happy with the unemployment, but this unemployment was not started or was not created by this administration. The administration is just trying to put things together, which of course will take some time.\n\n\"And you know, I agree with Nigerians, when you're hungry, you don't want to listen to anything again because you're hungry. But, understand that somebody is trying to solve that problem of hunger. So, let us not listen to political protests, political jobbers, who just want to be popular. We are going to elections very soon, and these are gimmicks, political gimmicks.\"", "source": {"uri": "blueprint.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blueprint Newspapers Limited"}, "authors": [],

Isn't a protest that is potentially violent another bad idea? Shola Oyeyipo asks.\n\nAs an instructive takeaway from the story of Sango, the god of thunder and lightning, the Yoruba are quick to warn that, \"whoever witnessed how Sango mysteriously vanished into thin air, in evident display of anger, would never knowingly denigrate the King of Koso.\"\n\nObakoso or Olukoso as Sango is otherwise called, actually means the king did not hang himself. This conclusion followed speculations that Sango had hanged himself after the thunder he created struck his palace and burnt it down. He had left the palace for a high rock directly opposite, to re-affirm the potency of his thunderbolt (edun ara).\n\nThe fire disaster, which extended to a large part of the city, sparked a riot, forcing people to curse Sango and demand his ouster from the throne. Instead, he left town on his volition, followed by chiefs and members of his royal cult, then known as Baba-Mogba, who tried to persuade him not to quit.\n\nAfter journeying with him for some time, some of the royal cult chiefs returned to Oyo with the news that the king had hanged himself. The twist, however, according to the other chiefs, who stayed the course, was that Sango was waylaid by Gbonka, one of his generals, who rebelled against him and ignited the crisis that consumed his reign.\n\nUnwilling to fight Gbonka, Sango, history had it, varnished into thin air, only to appear in the sky to destroy Gbonka, and those peddling the rumour that he had hanged himself.\n\nHere was the story of how the popular saying, \"Eni Sango ba ti oju e wo'le, ko ni ba w'on bu Obakoso\" came about.\n\nObakoso or Olukoso means the king did not hang himself.\n\nThis agelong saying, which seems to sum up the lesson of the last days of Sango, appears useful at this material time in the life of the nation, particularly in Lagos State. In other words, if the outcome of past protests was anything to ponder, then another protest is not advisable.\n\nSome angry youths of this country are unhappy with the state of the nation, especially the economy that is on a downward slope. There's no doubting the fact that the state of the nation requires some serious reflections with answers provided to the grey areas. But a protest, whose outcome no one could predict, is not the way to go at this delicate period.\n\nFour years ago, the youths of this country protested alleged police brutality, a decision no one could fault, and it lasted many days of destruction across the country, running into billions, with several deaths recorded as well.\n\nTagged #EndsSARS, the protest designed as a demand for the ban of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, amongst others, following the alleged excesses of its operatives, was soon hijacked and the nation, especially Lagos, is yet to recover from the ruination that followed.\n\nIn February 2023, tensions generated by the paucity of the new Naira peaked, and materialised in violent protests in some states, including Akwa Ibom, Delta, Edo, Imo, Kwara, Lagos, Ondo, Ogun, Oyo, and Rivers.\n\n\"During the civil unrest in the different states, several bank branches and ATM points were vandalised, and major roads were blocked,\" the United Nations recalled in a recent statement, warning against the idea of another protest.\n\nThe UN, therefore, added: \"As the turnout for the '10 days of rage' protest is expected to be high, large-scale disruptions to normal economic and social activities cannot be discounted.\"\n\nIt is against this backdrop that the growing argument against another protest and solidarity with Lagos becomes expedient. This intervention is crucial to the prosperity of the state. It is evident that things are bad. But is an idea that is potentially violent the answer? No!\n\nLike the proverbial hunter, who killed an elephant with a flip of his cap, and ended up with a fleeting moment of glory, the recent Kenya movement, which initially gained recognition across many nations, is fast paling into regrets. The damnation from the exercise is going to take many years to fix.\n\nThe man, who allegedly instigated the mass senselessness through his unbridled tongue, a member of the parliament, Hon. George Koimburi Ndung'u, now writhes in regrets. You can't but ponder how his \"Letter of Apology\" to the Speaker of Kenya's National Assembly, Hon. Moses Wetangule, could heal the wanton destruction wreaked on Kenya by the angry mob?\n\nFor Lagos, nay Nigeria, the good news, is that a majority of the people, coming from the recent past experiences, are totally against the idea of a protest, which appears designed to wrought yet another destruction on the state, and the nation.\n\nWhile the demands for a better living condition is sacrosanct, the approach, too, is as important, before the whole essence of the agitation and demand for a better society is lost to the indiscretion of a few, who seek to exploit the situation for personal aggrandizement.\n\nThe position taken by students of the various tertiary institutions in Lagos State, who have distanced themselves from the move, and instead, mooted a solidarity walk with the state government under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, is a welcome development.\n\nThe students, under the aegis of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), said instead of joining the planned protest, they would embark on a \"Solidarity Walk\" on the same dates as the protest to support and encourage Sanwo-Olu, who they said has been of great support to them.\n\nSpeaking to journalists at a press conference at the Lagos State University College of Medicine (LASUCOM), Ikeja, after a joint meeting, the student leaders across tertiary institutions in the state, said their solidarity walk would also be held from August 1 to 10 to drum support for peace, especially to ensure that the ugly incident of #EndSARS\" of 2020 did not repeat itself.\n\nChairman, National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Lagos axis, Comrade Lekan Alimi, who addressed newsmen on behalf of the students of the various tertiary institutions in Lagos State, described the planned nationwide protests against the current hardship in the country as \"absolutely uncalled for.\"\n\nHe said, rather than join the protest, the students in Lagos would prefer to engage in constructive dialogue with governments in achieving collective goals.\n\nWhile noting that the trying times in the country would soon ease, he appealed to Nigerians to persevere a little more to enjoy the dividends of democracy as being propounded by the President Bola Tinubu administration.\n\nIt's also not in error that some social media influencers have started to campaign against any protest being staged in Lagos. They have realised the kindness, benevolence, and tolerance of the state and did not think the way to reciprocate such good deeds is by destroying its development pride.\n\nIt is true that things are tough. It is also true that the economy is still struggling and very true that the situation is breathing down heavily on everyone in the country, including a part of the leadership. But the way to get around it is not by willfully destroying state assets.\n\nWithout a doubt, the subsisting argument that protest - peaceful protest - is within the fundamental human rights of the citizens is immutable and an all-time constitutional reality. But what the prospective protesters should also know is that there is no absolute freedom anywhere in the world.\n\nThe state's number one responsibility is to protect life and property. That's also pegged strongly in the constitution. Therefore, since protesters are unable to tell when and if their peaceful rally could be hijacked and become violent, more so when there are parallel instances to cite, it speaks to wisdom to approach the matter cautiously and differently.\n\nLagos, a miniature of Nigeria, should not be turned into another theatre of violence and destruction, like the #EndSARS experience. Rather, constructive engagement in the overall interest of the state is the way to go.", "source": {"uri": "thisdaylive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THISDAYLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Steward paid $9 million in cash rent and $2 million cash interest on multiple working capital and additional loans to MPT in the first quarter of 2024.\n\n2. MPT provided Steward with a $60 million bridge loan in January. MPT and Steward's asset-backed creditors also previously provided Steward with $75 million each in additional loans to help the for-profit health system with \"re-tenanting and business divestiture efforts,\" according to the report.\n\n3. Most recently, the company approved $75 million in debtor-in-possession financing for Steward after it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy May 6. MPT has not committed to any additional funding and expects Steward to use the funds to maintain patient care while it searches for new hospital operators.\n\n4. \"Regarding Steward's recent filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we expect this process may facilitate an orderly transition of Steward's operations to new operators,\" Edward Aldag, chairman, president and CEO of Medical Properties Trust, said in the release. \"As Steward continues these efforts, MPT has agreed to provide $75 million in DIP funding to ensure continued operations and continuity of patient care.\"\n\n5. Normalized funds from operations was $142 million in the first quarter ended March 31, a 36% decrease from $222 million during the same time period in 2023. MPT blamed the \"significant decrease in revenue related to Steward\" for the NFFO decrease.\n\n6. MPT offloaded 75% interest in five Steward-operated Utah hospitals to Englewood, Colo.-based Catholic Health Initiatives Colorado, part of Chicago-based CommonSpirit Health, for around $1.1 billion in April. It also sold five hospitals in California and New Jersey for $350 million to Ontario, Calif.-based Prime Healthcare in April.\n\n7. Los Angeles-based Prospect Medical Holdings paid $7 million in cash rent and interest to MPT in the first quarter of 2024. MPT's estimated fair market value investment in PHP Holdings decreased by around $60 million in the first quarter of 2024 \"as the result of changes in independent third party appraisals,\" the release said.\n\n8. \"Looking ahead, we remain confident in the valuable role MPT serves in the healthcare ecosystem - providing operators with necessary financing solutions to optimize their capital stack and redirect resources towards caring for patients. We have constructed a highly diversified portfolio across geographies, operators, and facility types with significant long-term cash flow potential,\" Mr. Aldag said in the release.\n\n9. MPT's net loss for the first quarter hit $735.4 million, a significant decrease from the $33 million increase reported in the same period in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "beckershospitalreview.com",

Reports First Quarter Results", "body": "Edward K. Aldag, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"We continue to execute a capital allocation strategy that we now expect will exceed our initial target of $2.0 billion in liquidity transactions in 2024. This strategy has repeatedly validated MPT's approach to underwriting, demonstrated strong market demand for real hospital assets and provided immediate capital to reduce our debt.\"\n\nMr. Aldag continued, \"Regarding Steward's recent filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we expect this process may facilitate an orderly transition of Steward's operations to new operators. As Steward continues these efforts, MPT has agreed to provide $75 million in DIP funding to ensure continued operations and continuity of patient care.\n\nLooking ahead, we remain confident in the valuable role MPT serves in the healthcare ecosystem - providing operators with necessary financing solutions to optimize their capital stack and redirect resources towards caring for patients. We have constructed a highly diversified portfolio across geographies, operators, and facility types with significant long-term cash flow potential.\"\n\nIncluded in the financial tables accompanying this press release is information about the Company's assets and liabilities, operating results, and reconciliations of net income (loss) to NFFO, including per share amounts, all on a basis comparable to 2023 results.\n\nPORTFOLIO UPDATE\n\nMedical Properties Trust has total assets of approximately $17.4 billion, including $11.3 billion of general acute facilities, $2.4 billion of behavioral health facilities and $1.7 billion of post-acute facilities. As of March 31, 2024, MPT's portfolio included 436 properties and approximately 43,000 licensed beds leased to or mortgaged by 53 hospital operating companies across the United States as well as in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Finland, Colombia, Italy and Portugal.\n\nMPT's operations in the U.K. and in Continental Europe continue to benefit from strong growth in reimbursement rates, overall volumes and high acuity admissions. While expense headwinds remain, particularly for labor and energy, most operators are reporting increasing operating profits year-over-year.\n\nAcross the Company's U.S. portfolio, excluding facilities operated by Steward and Prospect Medical Holdings (\"Prospect\"), admissions are increasing almost universally across the general acute, inpatient rehabilitation (IRF) and inpatient behavioral portfolios. While reimbursement rates are not growing as fast as they are in Europe, they are generally accelerating, and our operators continue to succeed in reducing contract labor and limiting overall cost inflation.\n\nIn April, MPT achieved GOLD recognition as a 2024 Green Lease Leader by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Alliance. This represents an improvement versus its SILVER recognition last year, for implementing environmentally beneficial standards into executed lease agreements. To receive this recognition, the Company executed lease provisions requiring client energy and water disclosure and annual landlord-tenant engagement to discuss plans that optimize building performance.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Steward paid cash rent of $9 million as scheduled on the consolidated master lease and cash interest of $2 million on various working capital and other loans. Steward continued to fully pay rent for the unconsolidated Massachusetts portfolio. Subsequent to MPT's $60 million bridge loan extended to Steward in early January, the Company and Steward's asset-backed creditors each funded $75 million of additional loans, which were anticipated as Steward proceeded with re-tenanting and business divestiture efforts.\n\nAs announced earlier this week, MPT has approved $75 million in debtor-in-possession financing following Steward's decision to commence an in-court restructuring process under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Company has not committed to additional funding and expects Steward to use the financing to ensure continuity of patient care while accelerating the re-tenanting of hospitals to new operators. Any debtor-in-possession financing terms are subject to approval of the bankruptcy court.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024, Prospect paid cash rent and interest of $7 million to MPT. The estimated fair market value of MPT's investment in PHP Holdings declined by approximately $60 million during the first quarter as the result of changes in independent third party appraisals.\n\nOPERATING RESULTS AND OUTLOOK\n\nNet loss for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 was ($736 million) (($1.23) per share) compared to net income of $33 million ($0.05 per share) in the year earlier period. Net loss for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 included approximately $693 million ($1.16 per share) of impairments estimated and recorded pursuant to U.S. GAAP accounting rules and reflective of conservative assumptions regarding potential recoveries, which MPT remains committed to pursuing. These impairments included the full reserve of the Company's approximate $360 million loan to Steward, its equity investment in Steward and its loan to the International Joint Venture.\n\nNFFO for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024 was $142 million ($0.24 per share) compared to $222 million ($0.37 per share) in the year earlier period. The primary cause of the decrease in NFFO year-over-year was the significant decrease in revenue related to Steward.\n\nA reconciliation of net (loss) income to FFO and NFFO, including per share amounts, can be found in the financial tables accompanying this press release.\n\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\n\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call and webcast for May 9, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to present the Company's financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.

Please let us know if you have feedback.\n\nDive Insight:\n\nWhile MPT has a portfolio of 436 properties, analysts were focused on the impact of Steward's bankruptcy filing on the company.\n\n\"When an operator representing ~20% of revenue (4Q23) goes bankrupt, there is not much else worth focusing on,\" wrote a Jeffries analyst it in a research note Thursday morning.\n\nMPT holds long-term leases on 36 Steward-operated facilities, according to its earnings filing. Steward fell behind on rent payments last year and filed for bankruptcy Monday, disclosing $9 billion in debt.\n\nMPT is solely backing Steward's $75 million debtor-in-possession bankruptcy financing, which has raised eyebrows. But MPT CEO Edward Aldag said other lenders considered financing Steward.\n\n\"There absolutely were others or other lenders involved [in financing discussions], as you know, but we're not gonna get into the details of those negotiations at this point,\" said Aldag.\n\nThe real estate investment trust has already lent Steward hundreds of millions of dollars even as the loans have dragged down MPT's own revenues. Aldag, for example, attributed much of the company's quarterly loss to impairments related to MPT's 2021 loan to Steward for $360 million.\n\nSteward did pay $9 million in rent to MPT this quarter. However, that comes after MPT financed a $60 million bridge loan in January and an additional $75 million asset-backed loan, according to the earnings report.\n\nAldag declined to comment directly on a variety of Steward matters, ranging from whether some hospitals might close during bankruptcy proceedings, to which specific companies are in talks to take over Steward's leases.\n\nHospital sales are a key factor moving forward for Steward. MPT said it might give the hospital operator further funding of up to $225 million if it sells its hospitals this summer -- a timeline Steward's legal counsel called \"not feasible\" in a bankruptcy hearing this week.\n\nAldag expressed confidence that the deals could get done, saying some hospital sales have been in the works for five or six months.\n\n\"We're way down the road with many different people,\" Aldag said.\n\nAldag said MPT's rental agreements were not what landed Steward in bankruptcy proceedings as he struck out against \"misinformation\" about MPT's business model.\n\n\"Rent is never mentioned by Steward on the list of contributing factors to its financial stress,\" Aldag said. \"If Steward wasn't paying rent, they'd be paying interest in principal repayments on some type of financing for the facilities. Because as we all know, buildings are not free.\"\n\nExecutives also gave updates on other tenants, including Prospect Medical Holdings. MPT disclosed Thursday that Prospect only paid $7 million in rent during the quarter, and that the fair market value of the health system's assets declined by approximately $60 million.\n\nProspect has been struggling financially -- this time last year, the health system took out a $375 million ABL loan to help with liquidity.\n\nProspect has also been attempting to sell hospitals to Yale New Haven Health since 2022. However, Yale recently sued to get out of the deal, citing Prospect's \"irresponsible financial practices, severe neglect and general mismanagement\" of facilities.", "source": {"uri": "healthcaredive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Healthcare Dive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susanna_vogel@healthcaredive.com", "name": "Susanna Vogel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanma_Posts_and_Telecommunications", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Myanma Posts and Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Properties_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical Properties Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor_in_possession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor in possession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate investment trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospect_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prospect (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_market_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fair market value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Haven,_Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Haven, Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Loans", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Loans", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Commercial_Lending", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Commercial Lending", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.healthcaredive.com/imgproxy/-zQ26oREndanUNAorBau33-vkhw5a91ZwJrbQLAVhsc/g:ce/rs:fill:770:435:0/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL1hhdmllcl9MYWxhbm5lLVRhdXppYS1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWVhcm5pbmdzLnBuZw.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555059", "eventUri": "eng-9555059", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Please note that in our press release, Medical Properties Trust has reconciled all non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in accordance with Reg G requirements. You can also refer to our website at medicalpropertiestrust.com for the most directly comparable financial measures and related reconciliations. I will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Ed Aldag.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Charles, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning on our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined again today by Steve Hamner, Rosa Hooper and Kevin Hanna. You will hear from each of them shortly. For the past several quarters, you've heard me say that we're focused on executing a capital allocation strategy to generate at least $2 billion of additional liquidity in 2024.\n\nI'm pleased to share that we've made strong progress on this strategy, executing $1.6 billion of total liquidity transactions this year, including the recently announced sale of 75% of our interest in five Utah hospitals to a new joint venture with a leading multibillion-dollar asset manager. We've used the proceeds from these transactions to pay down near-term debt, including full repayment of our Australian term loan that was due in 2024. Importantly, while we've already reached 80% of our initial liquidity target, we're just getting started. And now, expect to exceed that amount for the year.\n\nOur early results prove there is strong demand for our assets at attractive valuations. We have several available levers to generate additional liquidity and we remain actively engaged in numerous discussions. As with the transactions already executed, we expect to continue demonstrating the value and cash flow potential, embedded in our portfolio throughout the year. Turning to Stewart and its decision earlier this week to commence a Chapter 11 restructuring process.\n\nThere has obviously been a great deal of media attention on this filing. And we want to take a few minutes to share our perspective directly with all of you. First, if you've had an opportunity to read through the first day declarations that Steward filed with the US Bankruptcy Court, you will find a clear story of how Steward got here. Notably, no mention was made of rent as a contributor to Steward's distress.\n\nWe believe that bankruptcy will facilitate the retenanting or sale of Steward Hospitals in an orderly and timely fashion. We firmly believe that an orderly transition of Steward Hospitals to new operators is in the best interest of everyone, and we're committed to providing a $75 million in debt financing to help achieve that. We expect Steward to use this financing to ensure continuity of patient care while accelerating the retenanting of these hospitals. To be clear, we have not committed to providing any additional funding beyond this initial $75 million.\n\nAs I said before, rent is never mentioned by Steward on the list of contributing factors to his financial stress. That's because rent, which represents only a small fraction of a hospital's total revenue is virtually never the primary cost of financial stress for hospitals. And as Steward wasn't paying rent, they'd be paying interest and principal repayments on some type of financing for the facilities, because as we all know, buildings are not free. While we've seen a great deal of misinformation recently reported about our business model, the fact remains that MPT provides hospital operators permanent and affordable capital enabling them to redirect the substantial cash resources that would otherwise be used for real estate to their primary mission, healing patients.\n\nWe continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with parties interested in the Steward Hospitals. It would be inappropriate for us to discuss the details of each of these transactions until they are approved by the court. I will now turn it over to Rosa to discuss the performance of our portfolio. Rose?\n\nRosa Hooper -- Senior Vice President of Operations and Secretary\n\nThank you, Ed. As with the past few quarters, I'll take you through some of the highlights across our portfolio of critical hospital real estate, beginning with a few high-level comments. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we were pleased with the solid sequential and year-over-year coverage improvements delivered across our portfolio. In fact, on a discrete quarter over quarter sequential basis, our general acute inpatient rehab and LTAC segments all reported increasing coverage in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnd during the first quarter of 2024, volume trends across our portfolio, excluding Steward and Prospect grew in line with and, in some cases, outpaced the growth of large public operators. Behavioral health hospitals, which represent 14% of our portfolio, continue to see increasing volumes year over year as these facilities prove their enduring value in their respective communities. While LTACHs have seen declining year-over-year volumes as a result of the CMS waiver expiration last May, it is worth noting that these facilities represent just 1.5% of our portfolio and are generally part of larger operators that include inpatient rehab and/or acute care hospitals, therefore, ensuring diversification and additional coverage for ongoing rent payments. Going forward, we will no longer provide individual disclosure of LTACH coverages but will instead begin to combine them with inpatient rehab coverages for a post-acute property type.\n\nIn the U.K. and Continental Europe, operators continue to benefit from strong growth in reimbursement rates, overall volumes and higher acuity emission. Leading most operators to report increasing operating profit year over year. Circle remains well positioned in the U.K.\n\nprivate healthcare market with steady volume growth and increasing patient acuity that is expected to extend through 2024. With the sustained growth of private health insurance coverage and self-pay in the U.K. Circle has delivered steady financial performance and expect that strong performance to be maintained. As the largest independent mental healthcare provider in the U.K.\n\nby a number of beds priority continues to capitalize on increased demand for behavioral health services within the U.K. They are seeing steadily improving reimbursement trends, along with stable occupancy levels and remain focused on cost-effective management to ensure quality and efficient care. Together, these focus areas are driving incremental improvements in coverage and earnings. Forest parent company, MEDIAN, has largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its German operations with improving occupancy, favorable reimbursement rates, moderating inflation and strong cost control.\n\nMEDIAN's operating margins have proven resilient over the past several years and we expect them to maintain that stability. While Swiss Medical's profitability was marginally impacted by inflationary pressures, and investments related to its pioneering integrated care network in 2023. Initial results from the first quarter already indicate that these temporary headwinds are abating. In addition, Swiss Medical's Janelle Innovation Hub, which began construction in 2021, remains on track to open in the second half of 2024.\n\nTurning to our U.S. portfolio. Excluding Steward & Prospect, we're seeing increasing admissions almost universally across our diversified portfolio of general acute hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, or IRFs, and payroll health facilities. Reimbursement rates are generally accelerating and operators are doing a commendable job of controlling costs in this inflationary environment.\n\nA major highlight for the quarter was the announcement of the new JV, we formed with a leading investment firm involving our hospitals in the Salt Lake City area of Utah operated by common spirits. We are pleased to retain an approximate 25% interest in these facilities and expect strong performance trends to persist over the long-term. Ernest Health reported stable performance with consolidated EBITDARM coverage above two times. Ernest IRF are performing well with coverage in excess of two times on their same-store IRF, excluding Ernest's three recent developments, it is approaching three times.\n\nErnest total reported coverage was adversely impacted at its LTACH facilities by the volume headwinds I mentioned earlier. As an important reminder, LTACH comprised less than 20% of our investment in Ernest and their rent is more than covered by the IRFs. Shifting to Prime, as part of the California and New Jersey sale transaction, MPT and Prime agreed to a new 20-year master lease for our remaining four Prime hospitals. The new master lease includes a purchase option for Prime to buy the real estate of these remaining hospitals for a minimum purchase price of $238 million.\n\nThey report increasing volumes and normalization of labor costs, which has led to improved EBITDARM for MPT owned hospitals. At our LifePoint hospitals, volumes have sustained momentum, following the nice rebound we saw in the fourth quarter of 2023. As a result, LifePoint MPT-owned LifePoint facilities have delivered meaningful EBITDARM improvements over the last several months, including an encouraging March in which they deliver the highest monthly EBITDARM in more than two years. LifePoint's recently dedicated cardiovascular and Surgical Care Pavilion at Conemaugh, Memorial and Pennsylvania, has been very well-received by the community, and we remain optimistic that it will further position that market for future success.\n\nOur LifePoint behavioral facilities inpatient volumes have steadily increased, offsetting seasonal declines in volumes from partial hospitalization programs and intensive outpatient programs. At ScionHealth, general acute facilities reported nearly a full turn improvement in coverage year over year to 1.9 times, driven by double-digit volume increases and substantial reductions in contract labor. However, like Ernest, LTACH performance has been adversely impacted by the waivers that expired in 2023. Finally, Prospect paid cash, rent and interest of approximately $7 million during the quarter and reported EBITDARM coverage of approximately one-time on its California portfolio for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nCoverage has further increased to approximately 1.3 times on a trailing 12-month basis through the end of February. Prospect paid March rent for California after the end of the quarter. However, at this time, MPT has not yet received rent for the months of April and May. To briefly summarize, before I turn it over to Kevin, the majority of operators in our highly diversified portfolio continued to perform well, and we are encouraged by the volume and cost trends we're seeing across geographies and care settings.\n\nAs such, we remain confident in the core pillars of our business model and the long-term cash flow potential of our portfolio. Kevin?\n\nKevin Hanna -- Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Rosa. This morning, we reported a GAAP net loss of $1.23 per share and normalized FFO of $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2024. As mentioned in our earnings release, first quarter results included approximately $18 million of consolidated cash revenue from Steward and Prospect. It is worth noting that Steward additionally continue to make full payment as it relates to the Massachusetts partnership portfolio, about $19 million in the first quarter at MPT share.\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, Steward has paid $9.5 million in rent, half of which is MPT share and Prospect has paid roughly $7 million. We also described approximately $693 million in non-cash impairments recorded in the quarter, primarily related to non-real estate investments in Steward and International joint venture. These charges were estimated and recorded pursuant to U.S. GAAP accounting rules and reflect conservative assumptions regarding potential recoveries, which MPT remains committed to pursuing.\n\nAs was the case last quarter, investments in the operations of Steward and investment in the operations of the International joint venture were evaluated with assistance of a third-party independent appraiser. The first quarter charges included the full impairment of MPT's approximately $360 million loan to Steward made in 2021, the remainder of its equity investment in Steward and other obligations. Further, we impaired our full investment in the international joint venture. As a reminder, these investments were previously moved to cash basis accounting and no related income was recorded in the first quarter.\n\nIt is worth noting a couple of other adjustments to normalized FFO. First, we adjusted the book value of our investment in PHP Holdings downward by approximately $60 million, based on the most recent third-party independent appraisal. Further, we recognized an approximately $8 million loss on our sales of priority term loan, as well as an $8 million negative adjustment to the fair value of marketable securities, such as our shares and EBIT. One thought before I hand it over to Steve, we remind investors in advance of our 10-Q filing, that first quarter cash flows from operations is typically influenced negatively by the timing of cash interest payments on our debt, assuming no impact from transactions or Steward retaining activity, we would expect 2024 cash flow from operations to be seasonally weighted to the back half of the year.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to Steve for a discussion of liquidity and our overall capital allocation strategy. Steve?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Kevin. I'll begin by echoing Ed's earlier comments about the success of the liquidity plan we described late last year, which is working even better than we predicted. At that time, we estimated that during all of 2024, we would generate $2 billion from asset sales and secured financing. By halfway through April, we had achieved $1.6 billion or 80% of the initial estimate.\n\nAnd those transactions were executed during a particularly volatile period, in terms of inflation and interest rates. Based on those early successes, we believe we will exceed our $2 billion target for 2024, with additional transactions at attractive valuations and capitalization rates well inside of what our public securities imply. Going back a bit further, MPT has reduced its net debt by $1.6 billion since this time last year. We've accomplished this delevering primarily with about $2.4 billion of proceeds from profitable asset sales, including completely exiting Australia, selling hospitals back to operators pursuant to their repurchase options, and most recently, our sale of 75% on of our Utah facilities for almost $900 million of cash proceeds, and that does not include the $190 million of non-recourse financing proceeds.\n\nAs a slide note, this Utah transaction fully validates the price we paid for these hospitals in 2020, when they were operated by Steward. We are pleased to retain a 25% interest, which provides us the opportunity to participate in any future increases in the values of these assets. We currently have about $900 million in immediately available liquidity through cash balances and revolver capacity. Planned uses for this current liquidity, as well as future operating cash flows and any proceeds from potential additional transactions include up $275 million for the Steward debtor in possession loan.\n\nAnd as Ed mentioned, we have made no commitment to fund any more than that. Repayment of \u00a3100 million, that's about US$130 million in a sterling-denominated seller financing loan, due late this year and prepayment of approximately another \u00a3105 million or another roughly $130 million, related to our Sterling denominated term loan. And up to about $230 million in development commitments, including two projects that may be sold, so the actual amount of that funding is uncertain. Partly in recognition of our success in selling assets at attractive valuations and also in light of the deteriorating Steward situation prior to its bankruptcy filing, we recently amended our bank facilities.\n\nOne of our bank loan financial covenants limits the amount of unsecured debt as a percentage of unencumbered assets to 65%. For that calculation, the amount of unencumbered assets leased to tenants in bankruptcy is limited to 10%. The Bank Group agreed to waive this 10% limitation through the early -- through the quarterly June 30 test, which means that all else equal. Steward assets will remain in the unencumbered asset calculation for financial covenants until the next quarterly test on September 30.\n\nOur plan and expectation are that during the five months until September 30, we will replace Steward with better qualified operators at many of our hospitals they are currently leased to Steward. So that even if Steward remains in bankruptcy at that time and the waiver is not extended, its effect on our unencumbered asset value-based financial coveted expected to be mitigated. Second, given our current priorities and the liquidity generated from asset sales and financing transactions already executed and expected in the future, we no longer need the large $1.8 billion revolving credit facility that we had during earlier years, when our acquisitions exceeded $3-plus billion annually. Accordingly, we offer to reduce the revolver commitment by $400 million down to $1.4 billion.\n\nFurther, because the majority of these liquidity transactions are expected to be sales rather than secured financings, we project relatively low levels of secured borrowings for the foreseeable future. And accordingly, we were willing to reduce our secured debt basket from 40% down to 25%. Before going to questions, I'll just summarize and point out, we have addressed all our 2024 maturities. We have only the 100 million-pound sterling mortgage remaining to be paid.\n\nAnd we expect to have significant liquidity going into 2025, and that's before considering the possible liquidity that we expect to achieve from the additional transactions that I've alluded to. Our plans remain to continue to monetize assets, increase liquidity and reduce debt and retenant hospital real estate that is currently leased to Steward. And with that, I will turn it over to questions, operator.\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And the first question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. First, just wondering if all of the facilities leased to Steward are open and operating and whether you expect that will remain the case? And just wondering if you're still receiving the weekly cash flow reports from Steward's Advisors and just any changes for better or worse there?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Austin, all of the facilities other than the ones that were previously closed prior to bankruptcy continue to be operating. And then, the second question, we do continue to receive cash flow reports from Steward advisors, and they have so far exceeded their projections on, I believe, every week.\n\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nSo as you start negotiations or have been in negotiations with other parties to backfill the operations at these facilities, I mean, what's the thinking around potential rent moving forward relative to Steward's prior contractual cash rent?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo the hospitals, as we've been saying for many months, on a localized four-wall perspective are generating positive EBITDAR. The issues with Steward, which are very well laid out in the bankruptcy filings, are around legacy payables, revenue cycle management, the level of revenue reimbursement. So all of that is to say that we believe that these hospitals can continue to pay rent at the contractual levels. Now, there's obviously a lot that goes into negotiation.\n\nAnd with bankruptcy, there's more scrutiny. But that's a long-winded way of saying we anticipate across the portfolio to continue to get at or near the amount of rent that the current lease agreements call for.\n\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nAnd then, just last one for me. I guess, any sense on the time line of when you could start to get any of these facilities back or whether any of these leases will be rejected for any reasons either for better or worse? That's all for me. Thank you.\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nI'm sorry. I think your question was around the time line. And I think, again, in the bankruptcy filings, there are some very strict target date to have agreements in place, that would then start the regulatory process. I won't get into bankruptcy law because I don't think many of us are lawyers on this call.\n\nBut we have no indication that Steward would have any motivation in rejecting either of the two master leases.\n\nThe next question will come from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Just curious on the DIP financing, why did you guys feel the need to provide the DIP financing? And then, I was looking over the BK documents.\n\nJust curious why it's called junior debt and then what is it in your build?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJosh, the reason that we decided to do the $75 million DIP financing is exactly as I said in my prepared remarks is that we think it's very important that the hospitals continue to operate as we go through this process.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nWere there no other potential folks you would be willing to provide the financing in the BK?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, they absolutely were. There are other lenders involved, as you know, but we're not going to get into the details of those negotiations at this point.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. And then, in the BK document, it was referred to as junior DIP financing, I think it's correct term. Just curious, does that mean it's junior to other like debt or claims? Or why was that term used?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, because of the security waterfall, and as you alluded to, there is -- there are other lenders that have first liens on the typical collateral of receivables.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. I am -- if I was -- I'm wrong, but I always thought that financing was like the most secure claim. On the PHP holdings write-down, just could you kind of walk us through like what drove the fair market adjustment? Like what's driving that? And how does that potentially impact the potential monetization, I think you guys have talked about in the past?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nIt's based on, as we do every quarter, independent appraisals and evaluations of a lot of inputs, including things like discount rate financing rates. So it's really on a private basis. I think, as Kevin described, like any other security that we value on a fair market basis. It's clearly an estimate, and it is not based on our -- necessarily our expectation of what happens to PHP or when.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. So just the way that you answered it, was it more based on just like moves in interest rates? Or was there something that changed with like the cash flows of the underlying investments?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. I think the biggest piece, as Steve alluded to, was the discount rate and some working capital adjustments as well, but mainly the discount rate.\n\n[Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown speaker -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nHi, this is George on for Vikram. Can you just comment on prospects? How should we think about the rent recovery there?\n\nWell, as Rosa pointed out, we have collected the rent on the California assets through March, but that March payment came subsequent to March. And as of now, we've not collected April or May.\n\nRosa Hooper -- Senior Vice President of Operations and Secretary\n\nThere's a point, the cost payments are expected in the coming months, which will be a slug of cash for prospects. So we would anticipate getting -- them having additional proceeds at the time.\n\nUnknown speaker -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nOK. That's helpful. And just can you provide more color on the pricing of the dispositions that you did in April and you mentioned you're likely to exceed the $2 billion target of liquidity. How does this number look like today? And what are your expectations?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo I think we mentioned this, and it's a good question last quarter with respect to the Prime assets that we sold, which we calculated a mid-7s cap rate. And we said that the negotiations we were under going at that time, and frankly, we remain where we closed one of those and we remain negotiating others. That cap rate in the mid-7s plus or minus, is very indicative when adjusted for geography and size and quality of assets to what we expect to achieve on the additional sales or financings that we have mentioned.\n\nUnknown speaker -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nAnd just how large do you think the pipeline would be? Like how much above the $2 billion? If you can provide more color, that would be super help.\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, you're breaking up a little bit, but if I heard you correctly, of course, we've already achieved 80% of the $2 billion. And based on those results, and our visibility into the market into potential buyers and financing sources. That's why we said we think we'll ultimately exceed the $2 billion, through the remainder of 2024 and we think it will be at similar pricing, attractive pricing for us\n\nThe next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks. Steve and Rosa, I wanted to circle back on the prospect situation. I guess how concerning is it that they haven't paid April and May rents? And I know Rosa, you said that QAF payments are going to come in.\n\nI mean, does that fix their situation? And what month do those QAF payments come in?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo your question, how concerning is, of course, the prospects have been on a cash basis for some time. And as Rosa mentioned, I'll let her address the QAF in a minute. We've always had with our California operators this QAF issue. And then, when you combine it with respect specifically to Prospect, and delays in disposing of other regions in the country, they have significant cash pressures on.\n\nBut aside from that, having been paid through the quarter, with the QAF issue, that again, is not unexpected. We remain confident that ultimately the cash will come in to pay the rent in California.\n\nThose QAF payments are due at the end -- or should come in by the end of this month into May, and it's a substantial sum. It should really help them with their cash flow.\n\nYes. I'm assuming that what the Connecticut and Pennsylvania and maybe the Rhode Island assets are kind of weighing that down. If they -- as they are missing these rent payments, do they have other cash pressures that are making their position tighter, I guess, does missing these rent payments in April and May solve their cash issues? Or are they falling behind another vendor payables that they may have?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nI don't think we have a comment on that. Again, we expect to get our rent, and they're operating at a level. And again, as mentioned, the very positively improving coverage. Now, you have to convert that coverage to cash, and that's what we expect comes in with the QAF.\n\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nOK. And then, just finally, Steve, can you talk a little bit about the -- what you're expecting for the Steward transitions? I know you said in your prepared remarks that didn't need the 10% BK covenant test in September, do you expect it transitions to occur, do you expect a portion of transitions to occur? And I did look at the BK filing saying that they expect some of the stuff to get done by the beginning of August. I mean, I'm assuming for this to get done by the beginning of August, you would need to have a lot of process already underway? I mean, can you comment on how much interest there are in those hospitals right now? And are people looking at the financials to get ready to put in bids? Or is that process just starting right now?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nMike, it's been going on for almost five months now. We're way down the road with many different people.\n\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nAnd then, Steve, your comment on the 10% BK covenant, was that -- do you expect a percentage of the Steward hospitals to be transitioned? Or like can you kind of clarify that comment?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, I'll try to clarify. I won't try to predict. The point I was trying to make is, if we need relief from that covenant at the end of September, we would expect that need, all else equal, to be substantially mitigated by the number of hospitals that move away from the Steward relationship into new relationships. Now, we don't try to predict exactly which hospitals will transition, on which date.\n\nBut between now and the end of this almost five-month period, we do think that -- again, based on what Ed just said, remember this didn't just start with the filing of bankruptcy. They've been marketing these hospitals for at least five or six months. But we do expect, without specifying which hospitals, go win, we do expect that a meaningful amount of Steward exposure will be moved away to new operators before the end of September.\n\nYour next question will come from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mueller -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n\nYes. Hi. Maybe a couple of quick ones here. I guess following up on the prior question.\n\nCan you give us a high level sense of at the end of this process, what portion of Steward assets you think you have now will ultimately be managed by other operators, either by sold or transitioned or whatever?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nMike, I'm not sure, I completely understand your question, but I think you said at the end of this transition whenever it is, do we expect any of the facilities to continue to be operated by Steward? Is that the question?\n\nMike Mueller -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n\nLet me rephrase it. I guess, at the end of this bankruptcy process at the other side of it, what portion of your Steward assets now do you think we'll be in the hands of other operators as opposed to being operated by Steward?\n\nOK. And then, I guess, as it relates to the recent news with Connecticut, Yale New Haven, I guess can you give us, I guess, current thoughts on what the Plan B is there, if that -- if those assets do not get sold?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. With the ongoing discussions between the state Yale and prospect, we're just not going to comment on that right now.\n\nThe next question will come from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Hughes -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good morning. Are there any concerns or discussions with new potential operators for the Steward properties, focusing on increasing market share that might lead to concentration issues and maybe scrutiny from the FTC? Or is it because Steward is in bankruptcy, the primary goal is to find a new operator and preserve healthcare services regardless of increased market share?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, Jonathan, it's a lot of different markets. So I can't be 100% accurate on this, but the best of my recovery right this moment, I don't think there are any that would require a market concentration issue.\n\nJonathan Hughes -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nOK. And then, maybe my second question on the dividend. The last month's dividend was declared after the Utah and the Prime transactions, which was consistent with your prior comments that the dividend is dependent on liquidity transactions. And that press release mentioned that it was a regular dividend, but that April dividend was declared more than five months after the prior.\n\nSo is it fair to assume future dividends might also be more sporadic and maybe given the change in Steward's status since then and focus on preserving liquidity, is the board still comfortable with that current dividend amount? Thanks.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Jonathan, our next board meeting is the same day as our Annual Meeting, which I believe is May 30, and it will be discussed at that point.\n\nJonathan Hughes -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Look forward hear to more. Thank you for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nThanks for the time. My first question is on the Utah transaction. The press release said $1.1 billion in proceeds prior to costs and reserves. Can you quantify what the cost and reserves are and I imagine some of it's capex? So any additional color on the deferred capex in that portfolio and how it impacted the transaction price would be helpful.\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, the reference to cost and reserves are just customary cost of a transaction fees, brokerage and typical reserves that our first lien lender may require. And I'm not quite sure if the follow-up question.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThere was nothing extraordinary in those expenses in reserve --\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nNo. No, that's my point. I'm not sure what was meant by capex.\n\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nThere's no additional capex that MPW needs to fund to get that headline purchase price?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThis is an absolute net lease that the operator, Common Spirit is responsible for capex.\n\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nOK. Next question is on Steward. So with the Macquarie JV, just given that Steward is still paying rent or MPWs lease payments due from Steward on either of your master leases with Steward subordinated to the JV when that was structured?\n\nLast question for me. Did you pledge any of your real estate as collateral in conjunction with the Steward ABL or bridge loan refinancing? And if so, how many assets have leaned against them right now?\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ed Aldag for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Chuck and we appreciate everyone listening today. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to call Drew or Tim, and they'll get your questions responded to as quickly as we can. Thank you.\n\nCharles Lambert -- Vice President, Treasurer, and Managing Director of Capital Markets\n\nKevin Hanna -- Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

I will now turn the call over to our chief executive officer, Ed Aldag.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Charles, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning on our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to be joined again today by Steve Hamner, Rosa Hooper and Kevin Hanna. You will hear from each of them shortly. For the past several quarters, you've heard me say that we're focused on executing a capital allocation strategy to generate at least $2 billion of additional liquidity in 2024.\n\nI'm pleased to share that we've made strong progress on this strategy, executing $1.6 billion of total liquidity transactions this year, including the recently announced sale of 75% of our interest in five Utah hospitals to a new joint venture with a leading multibillion-dollar asset manager. We've used the proceeds from these transactions to pay down near-term debt, including full repayment of our Australian term loan that was due in 2024. Importantly, while we've already reached 80% of our initial liquidity target, we're just getting started. And now, expect to exceed that amount for the year.\n\nOur early results prove there is strong demand for our assets at attractive valuations. We have several available levers to generate additional liquidity and we remain actively engaged in numerous discussions. As with the transactions already executed, we expect to continue demonstrating the value and cash flow potential, embedded in our portfolio throughout the year. Turning to Stewart and its decision earlier this week to commence a Chapter 11 restructuring process.\n\nThere has obviously been a great deal of media attention on this filing. And we want to take a few minutes to share our perspective directly with all of you. First, if you've had an opportunity to read through the first day declarations that Steward filed with the US Bankruptcy Court, you will find a clear story of how Steward got here. Notably, no mention was made of rent as a contributor to Steward's distress.\n\nWe believe that bankruptcy will facilitate the retenanting or sale of Steward Hospitals in an orderly and timely fashion. We firmly believe that an orderly transition of Steward Hospitals to new operators is in the best interest of everyone, and we're committed to providing a $75 million in debt financing to help achieve that. We expect Steward to use this financing to ensure continuity of patient care while accelerating the retenanting of these hospitals. To be clear, we have not committed to providing any additional funding beyond this initial $75 million.\n\nAs I said before, rent is never mentioned by Steward on the list of contributing factors to his financial stress. That's because rent, which represents only a small fraction of a hospital's total revenue is virtually never the primary cost of financial stress for hospitals. And as Steward wasn't paying rent, they'd be paying interest and principal repayments on some type of financing for the facilities, because as we all know, buildings are not free. While we've seen a great deal of misinformation recently reported about our business model, the fact remains that MPT provides hospital operators permanent and affordable capital enabling them to redirect the substantial cash resources that would otherwise be used for real estate to their primary mission, healing patients.\n\nWe continue to be pleased with the progress we are making with parties interested in the Steward Hospitals. It would be inappropriate for us to discuss the details of each of these transactions until they are approved by the court. I will now turn it over to Rosa to discuss the performance of our portfolio. Rose?\n\nRosa Hooper -- Senior Vice President of Operations and Secretary\n\nThank you, Ed. As with the past few quarters, I'll take you through some of the highlights across our portfolio of critical hospital real estate, beginning with a few high-level comments. During the fourth quarter of 2023, we were pleased with the solid sequential and year-over-year coverage improvements delivered across our portfolio. In fact, on a discrete quarter over quarter sequential basis, our general acute inpatient rehab and LTAC segments all reported increasing coverage in the fourth quarter.\n\nAnd during the first quarter of 2024, volume trends across our portfolio, excluding Steward and Prospect grew in line with and, in some cases, outpaced the growth of large public operators. Behavioral health hospitals, which represent 14% of our portfolio, continue to see increasing volumes year over year as these facilities prove their enduring value in their respective communities. While LTACHs have seen declining year-over-year volumes as a result of the CMS waiver expiration last May, it is worth noting that these facilities represent just 1.5% of our portfolio and are generally part of larger operators that include inpatient rehab and/or acute care hospitals, therefore, ensuring diversification and additional coverage for ongoing rent payments. Going forward, we will no longer provide individual disclosure of LTACH coverages but will instead begin to combine them with inpatient rehab coverages for a post-acute property type.\n\nIn the U.K. and Continental Europe, operators continue to benefit from strong growth in reimbursement rates, overall volumes and higher acuity emission. Leading most operators to report increasing operating profit year over year. Circle remains well positioned in the U.K.\n\nprivate healthcare market with steady volume growth and increasing patient acuity that is expected to extend through 2024. With the sustained growth of private health insurance coverage and self-pay in the U.K. Circle has delivered steady financial performance and expect that strong performance to be maintained. As the largest independent mental healthcare provider in the U.K.\n\nby a number of beds priority continues to capitalize on increased demand for behavioral health services within the U.K. They are seeing steadily improving reimbursement trends, along with stable occupancy levels and remain focused on cost-effective management to ensure quality and efficient care. Together, these focus areas are driving incremental improvements in coverage and earnings. Forest parent company, MEDIAN, has largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its German operations with improving occupancy, favorable reimbursement rates, moderating inflation and strong cost control.\n\nMEDIAN's operating margins have proven resilient over the past several years and we expect them to maintain that stability. While Swiss Medical's profitability was marginally impacted by inflationary pressures, and investments related to its pioneering integrated care network in 2023. Initial results from the first quarter already indicate that these temporary headwinds are abating. In addition, Swiss Medical's Janelle Innovation Hub, which began construction in 2021, remains on track to open in the second half of 2024.\n\nTurning to our U.S. portfolio. Excluding Steward & Prospect, we're seeing increasing admissions almost universally across our diversified portfolio of general acute hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, or IRFs, and payroll health facilities. Reimbursement rates are generally accelerating and operators are doing a commendable job of controlling costs in this inflationary environment.\n\nA major highlight for the quarter was the announcement of the new JV, we formed with a leading investment firm involving our hospitals in the Salt Lake City area of Utah operated by common spirits. We are pleased to retain an approximate 25% interest in these facilities and expect strong performance trends to persist over the long-term. Ernest Health reported stable performance with consolidated EBITDARM coverage above two times. Ernest IRF are performing well with coverage in excess of two times on their same-store IRF, excluding Ernest's three recent developments, it is approaching three times.\n\nErnest total reported coverage was adversely impacted at its LTACH facilities by the volume headwinds I mentioned earlier. As an important reminder, LTACH comprised less than 20% of our investment in Ernest and their rent is more than covered by the IRFs. Shifting to Prime, as part of the California and New Jersey sale transaction, MPT and Prime agreed to a new 20-year master lease for our remaining four Prime hospitals. The new master lease includes a purchase option for Prime to buy the real estate of these remaining hospitals for a minimum purchase price of $238 million.\n\nThey report increasing volumes and normalization of labor costs, which has led to improved EBITDARM for MPT owned hospitals. At our LifePoint hospitals, volumes have sustained momentum, following the nice rebound we saw in the fourth quarter of 2023. As a result, LifePoint MPT-owned LifePoint facilities have delivered meaningful EBITDARM improvements over the last several months, including an encouraging March in which they deliver the highest monthly EBITDARM in more than two years. LifePoint's recently dedicated cardiovascular and Surgical Care Pavilion at Conemaugh, Memorial and Pennsylvania, has been very well-received by the community, and we remain optimistic that it will further position that market for future success.\n\nOur LifePoint behavioral facilities inpatient volumes have steadily increased, offsetting seasonal declines in volumes from partial hospitalization programs and intensive outpatient programs. At ScionHealth, general acute facilities reported nearly a full turn improvement in coverage year over year to 1.9 times, driven by double-digit volume increases and substantial reductions in contract labor. However, like Ernest, LTACH performance has been adversely impacted by the waivers that expired in 2023. Finally, Prospect paid cash, rent and interest of approximately $7 million during the quarter and reported EBITDARM coverage of approximately one-time on its California portfolio for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023.\n\nCoverage has further increased to approximately 1.3 times on a trailing 12-month basis through the end of February. Prospect paid March rent for California after the end of the quarter. However, at this time, MPT has not yet received rent for the months of April and May. To briefly summarize, before I turn it over to Kevin, the majority of operators in our highly diversified portfolio continued to perform well, and we are encouraged by the volume and cost trends we're seeing across geographies and care settings.\n\nAs such, we remain confident in the core pillars of our business model and the long-term cash flow potential of our portfolio. Kevin?\n\nKevin Hanna -- Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Rosa. This morning, we reported a GAAP net loss of $1.23 per share and normalized FFO of $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2024. As mentioned in our earnings release, first quarter results included approximately $18 million of consolidated cash revenue from Steward and Prospect. It is worth noting that Steward additionally continue to make full payment as it relates to the Massachusetts partnership portfolio, about $19 million in the first quarter at MPT share.\n\nSubsequent to quarter end, Steward has paid $9.5 million in rent, half of which is MPT share and Prospect has paid roughly $7 million. We also described approximately $693 million in non-cash impairments recorded in the quarter, primarily related to non-real estate investments in Steward and International joint venture. These charges were estimated and recorded pursuant to U.S. GAAP accounting rules and reflect conservative assumptions regarding potential recoveries, which MPT remains committed to pursuing.\n\nAs was the case last quarter, investments in the operations of Steward and investment in the operations of the International joint venture were evaluated with assistance of a third-party independent appraiser. The first quarter charges included the full impairment of MPT's approximately $360 million loan to Steward made in 2021, the remainder of its equity investment in Steward and other obligations. Further, we impaired our full investment in the international joint venture. As a reminder, these investments were previously moved to cash basis accounting and no related income was recorded in the first quarter.\n\nIt is worth noting a couple of other adjustments to normalized FFO. First, we adjusted the book value of our investment in PHP Holdings downward by approximately $60 million, based on the most recent third-party independent appraisal. Further, we recognized an approximately $8 million loss on our sales of priority term loan, as well as an $8 million negative adjustment to the fair value of marketable securities, such as our shares and EBIT. One thought before I hand it over to Steve, we remind investors in advance of our 10-Q filing, that first quarter cash flows from operations is typically influenced negatively by the timing of cash interest payments on our debt, assuming no impact from transactions or Steward retaining activity, we would expect 2024 cash flow from operations to be seasonally weighted to the back half of the year.\n\nWith that, I will turn it over to Steve for a discussion of liquidity and our overall capital allocation strategy. Steve?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, Kevin. I'll begin by echoing Ed's earlier comments about the success of the liquidity plan we described late last year, which is working even better than we predicted. At that time, we estimated that during all of 2024, we would generate $2 billion from asset sales and secured financing. By halfway through April, we had achieved $1.6 billion or 80% of the initial estimate.\n\nAnd those transactions were executed during a particularly volatile period, in terms of inflation and interest rates. Based on those early successes, we believe we will exceed our $2 billion target for 2024, with additional transactions at attractive valuations and capitalization rates well inside of what our public securities imply. Going back a bit further, MPT has reduced its net debt by $1.6 billion since this time last year. We've accomplished this delevering primarily with about $2.4 billion of proceeds from profitable asset sales, including completely exiting Australia, selling hospitals back to operators pursuant to their repurchase options, and most recently, our sale of 75% on of our Utah facilities for almost $900 million of cash proceeds, and that does not include the $190 million of non-recourse financing proceeds.\n\nAs a slide note, this Utah transaction fully validates the price we paid for these hospitals in 2020, when they were operated by Steward. We are pleased to retain a 25% interest, which provides us the opportunity to participate in any future increases in the values of these assets. We currently have about $900 million in immediately available liquidity through cash balances and revolver capacity. Planned uses for this current liquidity, as well as future operating cash flows and any proceeds from potential additional transactions include up $275 million for the Steward debtor in possession loan.\n\nAnd as Ed mentioned, we have made no commitment to fund any more than that. Repayment of \u00a3100 million, that's about US$130 million in a sterling-denominated seller financing loan, due late this year and prepayment of approximately another \u00a3105 million or another roughly $130 million, related to our Sterling denominated term loan. And up to about $230 million in development commitments, including two projects that may be sold, so the actual amount of that funding is uncertain. Partly in recognition of our success in selling assets at attractive valuations and also in light of the deteriorating Steward situation prior to its bankruptcy filing, we recently amended our bank facilities.\n\nOne of our bank loan financial covenants limits the amount of unsecured debt as a percentage of unencumbered assets to 65%. For that calculation, the amount of unencumbered assets leased to tenants in bankruptcy is limited to 10%. The Bank Group agreed to waive this 10% limitation through the early -- through the quarterly June 30 test, which means that all else equal. Steward assets will remain in the unencumbered asset calculation for financial covenants until the next quarterly test on September 30.\n\nOur plan and expectation are that during the five months until September 30, we will replace Steward with better qualified operators at many of our hospitals they are currently leased to Steward. So that even if Steward remains in bankruptcy at that time and the waiver is not extended, its effect on our unencumbered asset value-based financial coveted expected to be mitigated. Second, given our current priorities and the liquidity generated from asset sales and financing transactions already executed and expected in the future, we no longer need the large $1.8 billion revolving credit facility that we had during earlier years, when our acquisitions exceeded $3-plus billion annually. Accordingly, we offer to reduce the revolver commitment by $400 million down to $1.4 billion.\n\nFurther, because the majority of these liquidity transactions are expected to be sales rather than secured financings, we project relatively low levels of secured borrowings for the foreseeable future. And accordingly, we were willing to reduce our secured debt basket from 40% down to 25%. Before going to questions, I'll just summarize and point out, we have addressed all our 2024 maturities. We have only the 100 million-pound sterling mortgage remaining to be paid.\n\nAnd we expect to have significant liquidity going into 2025, and that's before considering the possible liquidity that we expect to achieve from the additional transactions that I've alluded to. Our plans remain to continue to monetize assets, increase liquidity and reduce debt and retenant hospital real estate that is currently leased to Steward. And with that, I will turn it over to questions, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And the first question will come from Austin Wurschmidt with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. First, just wondering if all of the facilities leased to Steward are open and operating and whether you expect that will remain the case? And just wondering if you're still receiving the weekly cash flow reports from Steward's Advisors and just any changes for better or worse there?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nSo, Austin, all of the facilities other than the ones that were previously closed prior to bankruptcy continue to be operating. And then, the second question, we do continue to receive cash flow reports from Steward advisors, and they have so far exceeded their projections on, I believe, every week.\n\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nSo as you start negotiations or have been in negotiations with other parties to backfill the operations at these facilities, I mean, what's the thinking around potential rent moving forward relative to Steward's prior contractual cash rent?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo the hospitals, as we've been saying for many months, on a localized four-wall perspective are generating positive EBITDAR. The issues with Steward, which are very well laid out in the bankruptcy filings, are around legacy payables, revenue cycle management, the level of revenue reimbursement. So all of that is to say that we believe that these hospitals can continue to pay rent at the contractual levels. Now, there's obviously a lot that goes into negotiation.\n\nAnd with bankruptcy, there's more scrutiny. But that's a long-winded way of saying we anticipate across the portfolio to continue to get at or near the amount of rent that the current lease agreements call for.\n\nAustin Wurschmidt -- KeyBanc Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nAnd then, just last one for me. I guess, any sense on the time line of when you could start to get any of these facilities back or whether any of these leases will be rejected for any reasons either for better or worse? That's all for me. Thank you.\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nI'm sorry. I think your question was around the time line. And I think, again, in the bankruptcy filings, there are some very strict target date to have agreements in place, that would then start the regulatory process. I won't get into bankruptcy law because I don't think many of us are lawyers on this call.\n\nBut we have no indication that Steward would have any motivation in rejecting either of the two master leases.\n\nThe next question will come from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nYeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Just curious on the DIP financing, why did you guys feel the need to provide the DIP financing? And then, I was looking over the BK documents.\n\nJust curious why it's called junior debt and then what is it in your build?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nJosh, the reason that we decided to do the $75 million DIP financing is exactly as I said in my prepared remarks is that we think it's very important that the hospitals continue to operate as we go through this process.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nWere there no other potential folks you would be willing to provide the financing in the BK?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, they absolutely were. There are other lenders involved, as you know, but we're not going to get into the details of those negotiations at this point.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. And then, in the BK document, it was referred to as junior DIP financing, I think it's correct term. Just curious, does that mean it's junior to other like debt or claims? Or why was that term used?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, because of the security waterfall, and as you alluded to, there is -- there are other lenders that have first liens on the typical collateral of receivables.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. I am -- if I was -- I'm wrong, but I always thought that financing was like the most secure claim. On the PHP holdings write-down, just could you kind of walk us through like what drove the fair market adjustment? Like what's driving that? And how does that potentially impact the potential monetization, I think you guys have talked about in the past?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nIt's based on, as we do every quarter, independent appraisals and evaluations of a lot of inputs, including things like discount rate financing rates. So it's really on a private basis. I think, as Kevin described, like any other security that we value on a fair market basis. It's clearly an estimate, and it is not based on our -- necessarily our expectation of what happens to PHP or when.\n\nJoshua Dennerlein -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\n\nOK. So just the way that you answered it, was it more based on just like moves in interest rates? Or was there something that changed with like the cash flows of the underlying investments?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. I think the biggest piece, as Steve alluded to, was the discount rate and some working capital adjustments as well, but mainly the discount rate.\n\n[Operator instructions] Our next question will come from Vikram Malhotra with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nUnknown speaker -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nHi, this is George on for Vikram. Can you just comment on prospects? How should we think about the rent recovery there?\n\nWell, as Rosa pointed out, we have collected the rent on the California assets through March, but that March payment came subsequent to March. And as of now, we've not collected April or May.\n\nRosa Hooper -- Senior Vice President of Operations and Secretary\n\nThere's a point, the cost payments are expected in the coming months, which will be a slug of cash for prospects. So we would anticipate getting -- them having additional proceeds at the time.\n\nUnknown speaker -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nOK. That's helpful. And just can you provide more color on the pricing of the dispositions that you did in April and you mentioned you're likely to exceed the $2 billion target of liquidity. How does this number look like today? And what are your expectations?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo I think we mentioned this, and it's a good question last quarter with respect to the Prime assets that we sold, which we calculated a mid-7s cap rate. And we said that the negotiations we were under going at that time, and frankly, we remain where we closed one of those and we remain negotiating others. That cap rate in the mid-7s plus or minus, is very indicative when adjusted for geography and size and quality of assets to what we expect to achieve on the additional sales or financings that we have mentioned.\n\nUnknown speaker -- Mizuho Securities -- Analyst\n\nAnd just how large do you think the pipeline would be? Like how much above the $2 billion? If you can provide more color, that would be super help.\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, you're breaking up a little bit, but if I heard you correctly, of course, we've already achieved 80% of the $2 billion. And based on those results, and our visibility into the market into potential buyers and financing sources. That's why we said we think we'll ultimately exceed the $2 billion, through the remainder of 2024 and we think it will be at similar pricing, attractive pricing for us\n\nThe next question will come from Michael Carroll with RBC. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nYes. Thanks. Steve and Rosa, I wanted to circle back on the prospect situation. I guess how concerning is it that they haven't paid April and May rents? And I know Rosa, you said that QAF payments are going to come in.\n\nI mean, does that fix their situation? And what month do those QAF payments come in?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nSo your question, how concerning is, of course, the prospects have been on a cash basis for some time. And as Rosa mentioned, I'll let her address the QAF in a minute. We've always had with our California operators this QAF issue. And then, when you combine it with respect specifically to Prospect, and delays in disposing of other regions in the country, they have significant cash pressures on.\n\nBut aside from that, having been paid through the quarter, with the QAF issue, that again, is not unexpected. We remain confident that ultimately the cash will come in to pay the rent in California.\n\nThose QAF payments are due at the end -- or should come in by the end of this month into May, and it's a substantial sum. It should really help them with their cash flow.\n\nYes. I'm assuming that what the Connecticut and Pennsylvania and maybe the Rhode Island assets are kind of weighing that down. If they -- as they are missing these rent payments, do they have other cash pressures that are making their position tighter, I guess, does missing these rent payments in April and May solve their cash issues? Or are they falling behind another vendor payables that they may have?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nI don't think we have a comment on that. Again, we expect to get our rent, and they're operating at a level. And again, as mentioned, the very positively improving coverage. Now, you have to convert that coverage to cash, and that's what we expect comes in with the QAF.\n\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nOK. And then, just finally, Steve, can you talk a little bit about the -- what you're expecting for the Steward transitions? I know you said in your prepared remarks that didn't need the 10% BK covenant test in September, do you expect it transitions to occur, do you expect a portion of transitions to occur? And I did look at the BK filing saying that they expect some of the stuff to get done by the beginning of August. I mean, I'm assuming for this to get done by the beginning of August, you would need to have a lot of process already underway? I mean, can you comment on how much interest there are in those hospitals right now? And are people looking at the financials to get ready to put in bids? Or is that process just starting right now?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nMike, it's been going on for almost five months now. We're way down the road with many different people.\n\nMichael Carroll -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n\nAnd then, Steve, your comment on the 10% BK covenant, was that -- do you expect a percentage of the Steward hospitals to be transitioned? Or like can you kind of clarify that comment?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, I'll try to clarify. I won't try to predict. The point I was trying to make is, if we need relief from that covenant at the end of September, we would expect that need, all else equal, to be substantially mitigated by the number of hospitals that move away from the Steward relationship into new relationships. Now, we don't try to predict exactly which hospitals will transition, on which date.\n\nBut between now and the end of this almost five-month period, we do think that -- again, based on what Ed just said, remember this didn't just start with the filing of bankruptcy. They've been marketing these hospitals for at least five or six months. But we do expect, without specifying which hospitals, go win, we do expect that a meaningful amount of Steward exposure will be moved away to new operators before the end of September.\n\nYour next question will come from Mike Mueller with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Mueller -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n\nYes. Hi. Maybe a couple of quick ones here. I guess following up on the prior question.\n\nCan you give us a high level sense of at the end of this process, what portion of Steward assets you think you have now will ultimately be managed by other operators, either by sold or transitioned or whatever?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nMike, I'm not sure, I completely understand your question, but I think you said at the end of this transition whenever it is, do we expect any of the facilities to continue to be operated by Steward? Is that the question?\n\nMike Mueller -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\n\nLet me rephrase it. I guess, at the end of this bankruptcy process at the other side of it, what portion of your Steward assets now do you think we'll be in the hands of other operators as opposed to being operated by Steward?\n\nOK. And then, I guess, as it relates to the recent news with Connecticut, Yale New Haven, I guess can you give us, I guess, current thoughts on what the Plan B is there, if that -- if those assets do not get sold?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. With the ongoing discussions between the state Yale and prospect, we're just not going to comment on that right now.\n\nThe next question will come from Jonathan Hughes with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Hughes -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nHi. Good morning. Are there any concerns or discussions with new potential operators for the Steward properties, focusing on increasing market share that might lead to concentration issues and maybe scrutiny from the FTC? Or is it because Steward is in bankruptcy, the primary goal is to find a new operator and preserve healthcare services regardless of increased market share?\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes, Jonathan, it's a lot of different markets. So I can't be 100% accurate on this, but the best of my recovery right this moment, I don't think there are any that would require a market concentration issue.\n\nJonathan Hughes -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nOK. And then, maybe my second question on the dividend. The last month's dividend was declared after the Utah and the Prime transactions, which was consistent with your prior comments that the dividend is dependent on liquidity transactions. And that press release mentioned that it was a regular dividend, but that April dividend was declared more than five months after the prior.\n\nSo is it fair to assume future dividends might also be more sporadic and maybe given the change in Steward's status since then and focus on preserving liquidity, is the board still comfortable with that current dividend amount? Thanks.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nYes. Jonathan, our next board meeting is the same day as our Annual Meeting, which I believe is May 30, and it will be discussed at that point.\n\nJonathan Hughes -- Raymond James -- Analyst\n\nAll right. Look forward hear to more. Thank you for the time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question will come from John Pawlowski with Green Street. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nThanks for the time. My first question is on the Utah transaction. The press release said $1.1 billion in proceeds prior to costs and reserves. Can you quantify what the cost and reserves are and I imagine some of it's capex? So any additional color on the deferred capex in that portfolio and how it impacted the transaction price would be helpful.\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nWell, the reference to cost and reserves are just customary cost of a transaction fees, brokerage and typical reserves that our first lien lender may require. And I'm not quite sure if the follow-up question.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThere was nothing extraordinary in those expenses in reserve --\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nNo. No, that's my point. I'm not sure what was meant by capex.\n\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nThere's no additional capex that MPW needs to fund to get that headline purchase price?\n\nSteven Hamner -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n\nThis is an absolute net lease that the operator, Common Spirit is responsible for capex.\n\nJohn Pawlowski -- Green Street Advisors -- Analyst\n\nOK. Next question is on Steward. So with the Macquarie JV, just given that Steward is still paying rent or MPWs lease payments due from Steward on either of your master leases with Steward subordinated to the JV when that was structured?\n\nLast question for me. Did you pledge any of your real estate as collateral in conjunction with the Steward ABL or bridge loan refinancing? And if so, how many assets have leaned against them right now?\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Ed Aldag for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nEd Aldag -- Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Chuck and we appreciate everyone listening today. If you have any additional questions, please don't hesitate to call Drew or Tim, and they'll get your questions responded to as quickly as we can. Thank you.\n\nCharles Lambert -- Vice President, Treasurer, and Managing Director of Capital Markets", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors":

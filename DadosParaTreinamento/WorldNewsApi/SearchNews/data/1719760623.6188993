There are \u201cso many variables\u201d to how we live on this planet, she said. She sees her \u201cmission\u201d \u2013 both as a creative writing teacher at Barnard College in New York and in her books \u2013 is to get people to question \u201cwhat the idea of being authentic means and why we think this is so important\u201d. \u201cI understand that we don\u2019t want things to be false, we want things to be true, but then there\u2019s the leap from authenticity to the idea of purity, and therefore, what is not authentic or pure is somehow corrupt, and that\u2019s the danger zone,\u201d she added. Lahiri thinks this focus on origin is partly responsible for \u201cthe fallout we\u2019re seeing now\u201d in Gaza and in the three countries she has connections with: India, Italy and the US. \u201cWhat does Make America Great Again mean? What is this \u2018again\u2019 that we\u2019re talking about? What are we trying to get back to?\u201d she asked. The rise of Donald Trump, growing support for the rightwing populist party Lega in Italy, and Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201cnotion of what India is\u201d are all examples of an \u201cincreasingly nationalist sentiment\u201d that comes from \u201cbelieving that you have, you know, some sort of non-negotiable right to belong to a place\u201d, Lahiri said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never had that claim to any place and I think that we should try to think about the fact that we really are all passing through,\u201d she said. A sense of having a defined identity in a place \u201cis understandable\u201d, but the writer thinks it \u201cis a potentially very dangerous way of thinking of ourselves and our world, because identity is not fixed, and rootedness should not be tied to things like language and place\u201d. Having such a strong attachment to where you are from, and constantly wanting to identify where other people are from, can create a sense of xenophobia, she believes. \u201cIt boils down to two pronouns: us versus them.\u201d When people talk about \u201cour land\u201d, she said, they are often talking about land that was originally occupied by a different group of people. Having grown up in Rhode Island, Lahiri was taught to sing This Land Is Your Land: \u201cThere was complete negation of whose land it really actually had been,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much of history is built on states of exile\u201d, \u201cphysical movement\u201d and the creation of \u201chomelands\u201d, she said, adding that the emotional attachments we have placed on to this sense of place and belonging can \u201cpervert our knowledge of what is actually the case\u201d.", "summary": "<p>Flawed desire to restore authenticity and purity is fuelling right in US, India and Italy, author tells Hay festival</p><p>\u201cWhere are you really from?\u201d is a question that Jhumpa Lahiri gets asked \u201call the time\u201d.

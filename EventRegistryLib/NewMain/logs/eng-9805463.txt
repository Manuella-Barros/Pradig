As seen in video footage from the concert posted on TikTok, a fan asked Adele if she would marry her, and Adele's response turned heads.\n\n\"You can't marry me, I'm straight, my love,\" the \"Rolling in the Deep\" singer said. \"And my husband's here tonight. He's here.\"\n\nDays later, at another residency concert, Adele referred to herself as a \"not the greatest wife\" because she didn't understand American football and therefore couldn't connect to Rich, a sports agent, over it. Another hint came in October when Adele posted a photo of herself holding Rich's memoir, Lucky Me, with a diamond ring on her finger.\n\nOn November 19, celebrity Instagram blogger DeuxMoi shared messages from two fans who claimed to have been at British comedian Alan Carr's comedy show in Los Angeles, where Adele was reportedly also in attendance. The insiders claimed that when Alan, 47, who is a close friend to the pop star, asked the audience if anyone had gotten married recently, Adele shouted, \"I did!\" However, it wasn't clear at the time if she was serious.\n\nRich didn't do much to quell the rumors, instead evading a question about his possible marriage to Adele in an October 10 interview on CBS Mornings.\n\n\"We're in a good space. Happy. She's superb,\" the Klutch Sports Group CEO said of their relationship, although he wouldn't go into specifics because he's \"not the type of person\" to share details with the public.\n\n\"It's not for the media. It's not for paparazzi. It's for us,\" he added. When host Gayle King asked if she should refer to Adele as \"Mrs. Paul,\" Rich responded, \"You can say whatever you want.\"\n\nRich first revealed that he and Adele were spending time together in May 2021, although he made it clear to The New Yorker at the time that they were not officially dating. The couple went public with their romance in July that year while attending a Phoenix Suns game together.\n\n\"The chemistry between them is insane!\" an insider exclusively told Life & Style of their romance at the time.\n\nIn August 2022, Adele told Elle that she and Paul were not married yet, but she was completely \"in love\" and \"obsessed with\" him.", "source": {"uri": "lifeandstylemag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Life & Style"}, "authors": [{"uri": "beth_shilliday@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Beth Shilliday", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "elise_nelson@lifeandstylemag.com", "name": "Elise Nelson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rich-paul-adele.jpg?crop=0px%2C100px%2C3117px%2C1638px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805463", "eventUri": "eng-9805463", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 276, "textEnd": 284}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-16", "textStart": 765, "textEnd": 777}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-19", "textStart": 1434, "textEnd": 1445}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-10", "textStart": 1976, "textEnd": 1986}], "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

He's an NBA guy who has to go on the road -- they are very different -- and they hit a rough patch,\" a source told us at the time.\n\nAnd then, things looked to be going from bad to worse when Paul was spotted partying with his client LeBron James in Miami - on Adele's 34th birthday.\n\nNot a good sign!\n\nBut here we are, months later, and not only is Adele bragging about being a future bride, but there's also talk of a love nest being secured.\n\nSupposedly, Adele purchased a $58 million home in Beverly Hills for her and Paul.\n\nNow, it's going to be that much harder for Paul to let her down gently and pretend he don't want she after putting a ring on it and securing a home.\n\nBut that just means their love will never truly be water under the bridge.", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dina_sartore_bodo@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Dina Sartore-Bodo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-1463309849.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805463", "eventUri": "eng-9805463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

You're crazy, leave me alone.'\n\nThen, in November, fans reckoned Adele and Rich had already said 'I do' after she was seen sporting what looked to be a wedding band.\n\nAround the same time, Adele swung by Alan Carr's comedy show, where her Chatty Man bestie asked if anyone in the crowd had got married recently.\n\nTwo audience members claimed to gossip account Deuxmoi that Adele shouted: 'I did!'\n\nThe British musician started dating the American sports agent after her divorce from Simon Konecki, 50, with whom she shares son Angelo, 11.\n\nAdele and Simon were married from 2018 to 2021, having started dating in 2011.\n\nHer divorce was a huge subject of her album 30 which, as the chronically online among you will remember, she proudly declared was about 'divorce, babes, divorce.'\n\nSpeaking about her marriage breakdown, Adele confirmed the reason behind their split when she gave her most personal interview in 2021.\n\nTouching on her split, Adele said: 'It just wasn't...

The London-born legend recently confirmed her engagement to Rich following months of speculation.\n\nThe hitmaker is on a 'summer break' from Weekends with Adele at Las Vegas' Caesars Palace, with Adele having crossed the pond to perform on a European stage for the first time since 2016 with a ten-night residency in Munich across August. \"It's random but fabulous!\" declared the singer as she announced her comeback in January.\n\nThe latest record-breaking stretch of dates will see Adele perform in a 75,000-capacity 'pop-up arena' at Messe M\u00fcnchen in Munich. The dazzlingly modern stadium has been custom-built for the pop star to allow her to get as close as possible to fans.\n\nFollowing the news that Adele confirmed she and Rich would be marrying in the near future, the Mirror has taken a look back at her love life. During a concert at her Munich residency, a fan held a sign up asking for Adele's hand in marriage. But the musician was forced to turn them down, gently.\n\nResponding to the poster which read: \"Will you marry me?\" Adele, 36, said: \"I can't marry you because I'm already getting married!\" The Easy On Me songstress was previously married to Simon Konecki, but they parted ways a year after tying the knot in 2018. Adele admitted that she stepped back from the budding relationship as she couldn't fully commit following her divorce. This experience of navigating new relationships post-divorce inspired her song I Drink Wine, which she penned long before meeting Rich.\n\nSpeaking about the track, Adele confessed: \"I wasn't dating anyone. There was someone that I have loved not been in love with, but been so fond of, and have been for years but I was unable to pretend that I wasn't in my own storm.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I couldn't give myself properly. I couldn't be consistent, and neither could he. It wasn't right, leaving a marriage and then dating a year after. Even if you feel ready, it's a gaping, open wound whether you leave or you're left.\"\n\nAdele further explained that this individual wanted her to fully invest in their relationship, but she couldn't as she was still healing from her marital breakdown. During her interview with The Face, she admitted associating this person with the 'breakdown of her marriage'.\n\nAdele concluded: \"So, therefore, he is part of the storm. And I was just, you know, really honest with him about it, thank God.\" She added: \"Otherwise, I could've found myself in a situation being in a relationship I didn't want to be in after coming out of one.\"\n\nAdele is a doting mum to her young son Angelo, whom she shares with her ex-husband, and they've set up their lives close by each other for the sake of smooth co-parenting. The superstar songstress began dating sports super-agent Rich Paul after her divorce from Simon Konecki was finalised. The couple went public with their romance in 2021, with the Tottenham-born star reportedly married her long-term partner Rich in 2023.\n\nOpening up about her relationship with Rich Paul previously, Adele couldn't resist praising his intelligence and sense of humour. She's been quoted saying: \"He's just hilarious. Oh, he's so funny, he's hilarious, yeah. And very smart. You know, he's very, very smart. It's quite incredible watching him do what he does.\"\n\nIn a heartfelt revelation about her beau Rich, Adele shared some intimate thoughts on their connection, saying: \"It is the first time I've loved myself and been open to loving and being loved by someone else.\"\n\nA previous version of this story was published on June 3, 2024.\n\n* Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads .", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_bird@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Bird", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "zara_woodcock@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Zara Woodcock", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "mollie_quirk@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Mollie Quirk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Munich"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_residency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Concert residency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekends_with_Adele", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weekends with Adele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop-up retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesars_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caesars Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Drink_Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "I Drink Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_on_Me", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easy on Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/article33384585.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_screenshot-2021-11-18-at-140425.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805463", "eventUri": "eng-9805463", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

After reading a sign in the crowd that asked, \"Will you marry me?\" Adele replied, \"I can't marry you because I'm already getting married. So I can't.\"\n\nIn July 2021, the couple sparked romance rumors after they were spotted together in Phoenix at Game 5 of the NBA Finals. Adele and Paul, 42, had been dating \"for months\" before the public appearance, a source told Us Weekly at the time.\n\n\"He's very shy and keeps a low profile when they go out, whereas Adele is super sociable,\" the insider noted. \"The people they hang out with know them both personally already, so they don't have to introduce each other, which is probably why nobody picked up on their relationship sooner.\"\n\n\"He's just hilarious. Oh, he's so funny, he's hilarious, yeah. And very smart. You know, he's very, very smart. It's quite incredible watching him do what he does,\" she shared during her CBS special, Adele One Night Only, in November 2021. \"It'd be interesting to see what my reaction is like in general to anything that hurts me now that I feel so secure in myself, and I'm talking outside of romance as well.\"\n\nThat same month, Adele teased that she was \"definitely open\" to the idea of expanding her family with Paul, adding, \"I would like more children. It wouldn't be the end of the world if I don't have them because I have Angelo. But yeah, I think [that's in the cards].\"\n\nWhile attending the 2022 Brit Awards in February, the performer raised eyebrows when fans noticed a large diamond on her left ring finger. At the time, Adele explained that she would keep that aspect of her life private.\n\n\"If I was [engaged], would I ever tell anyone if I was or wasn't?\" the U.K. native said on The Graham Norton Show. \"[My Las Vegas residency] is absolutely 100 percent happening this year.

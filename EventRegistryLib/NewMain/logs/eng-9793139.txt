On Tuesday, August 6, 2024, the National Transportation Safety Board opens a two-day hearing on the blowout of the door plug from the Alaska Airlines flight traveling 16,000 feet above Oregon.\n\nInvestigators will question Boeing officials during a hearing starting Tuesday about the midflight blowout of a panel from a 737 Max, an accident that further tarnished the company's safety reputation and left it facing new legal jeopardy.\n\nThe two-day hearing could provide new insight into the Jan. 5 accident, which caused a loud boom and left a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines jet.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the two-day hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously no one was injured.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Tuesday, August 6, 2024, the National Transportation Safety Board opens a two-day hearing on the blowout of the door plug from the Alaska Airlines flight traveling 16,000 feet above Oregon.\n\nInvestigators are questioning Boeing officials in hearings this week about the midflight blowout of a panel from a 737 Max, an accident that further tarnished the company's safety reputation and left it facing new legal jeopardy.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board's two-day hearing, which began Tuesday morning, could provide new insight into the Jan. 5 accident that caused a loud boom and left a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines jet.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said as the hearing began Tuesday, speaking to anyone who may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nThe first witnesses called Tuesday included Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased. but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the opening and closing of the door plug and the FAA's oversight of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, the National Transportation Safety Board opens a two-day hearing on the blowout of a door plug from an Alaska Airlines flight traveling 16,000 feet above Oregon.\n\nBy David Koenig, Associated Press\n\nMonday, Aug. 5, 2024 | 10:21 p.m.\n\nInvestigators will question Boeing officials during a hearing starting Tuesday about the midflight blowout of a panel from a 737 Max, an accident that further tarnished the company's safety reputation and left it facing new legal jeopardy.\n\nThe two-day hearing could provide new insight into the Jan. 5 accident, which caused a loud boom and left a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines jet.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the two-day hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously no one was injured.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously no one was injured.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and--even worse in the agency's view--suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid--door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"", "source": {"uri": "inc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inc.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@inc.com", "name":

During the two-day hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously no one was injured.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(National Transportation Safety Board via AP, File)\n\nSpirit installed the door plug - a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes - on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB\u00b4s agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off - too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously no one was injured.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and - even worse in the agency's view - suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid - door plugs shouldn\u00b4t blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"\n\nFILE - The door plug from the Alaska Airlines Flight 1282's Boeing 737-9 MAX airplane is shown at the National Transportation Safety Board laboratory, in Washington, July 30, 2024.

During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices.

During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nThe first witnesses called Tuesday included Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased. but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the opening and closing of the door plug and the FAA's oversight of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"", "source": {"uri": "santamariatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Santa Maria Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices.

During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nHarris selects Minnesota Gov.

Investigators are questioning Boeing officials in hearings this week about the midflight blowout of a panel from a 737 Max, an accident that further tarnished the company's safety reputation and left it facing new legal jeopardy.\n\nWashington, Aug 6 (AP) Investigators are questioning Boeing officials in hearings this week about the midflight blowout of a panel from a 737 Max, an accident that further tarnished the company's safety reputation and left it facing new legal jeopardy.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board's two-day hearing, which began Tuesday morning, could provide new insight into the January 5 accident that caused a loud boom and left a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines jet.\n\nAlso Read | 'Hindus Are Very Afraid': Bangladesh ISKCON General Secretary Charu Chandra Das Brahmachari Seek's India's Help Amid Unrest (Watch Video).\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in opening statements Tuesday, noting that there are also injuries \"we can't see\" that may have lasting impacts on peoples' lives.\n\nSpeaking to anyone who may may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard Homendy said, \"On behalf of the entire agency, we are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nAlso Read | Hiroshima, Nagasaki Atomic Bombings: Lok Sabha Pays Tributes to Victims of Nuclear Bomb Attack in Japanese Cities in August 1945.\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented.\n\nDuring the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member.\n\nThe agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 metres).\n\nOxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\" (AP)", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details about the incident.\n\nThe captain described it as \"an explosive experience\" and said he couldn't communicate with flight attendants, according to the documents. On the intercom, he heard flight attendants talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Ore.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Ore., as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 metres).

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nAmong the first witnesses called Tuesday was Elizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLund and others also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on production and worker experience. Spirit Senior Vice President Terry George said that just five years ago, 95 per cent of its factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is five per cent, and they must get more training in drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Lund added, most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military, but \"coming out of COVID ... we found that considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\" She said the company has improved training since the January accident.\n\nBut others remained skeptical. \"We have never been impressed with Boeing's training at all,\" International Association of Machinists' representative Lloyd Catlin said. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it's enough.\"\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights.

On Tuesday, August 6, 2024, the National Transportation Safety Board opens a two-day hearing on the blowout of the door plug from the Alaska Airlines flight traveling 16,000 feet above Oregon.\n\nThe midflight blowout of a panel from a Boeing 737 Max jet was so powerful that it blew open the plane's cockpit door and tore off the co-pilot's headset, and federal investigators began questioning officials from Boeing and its key supplier on Tuesday to understand how the accident occurred.\n\n\"It was chaos,\" the co-pilot of that Alaska Airlines flight on Jan. 5 flight said in documents released by the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\nComments of the pilots, factory workers at Boeing and other people were released as the safety board held a rare investigative hearing into the blowout, an accident that further tarnished Boeing's safety reputation and left it facing new legal jeopardy.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board's two-day hearing, which began Tuesday, could provide new insight into accident that caused a loud boom and left a gaping hole in the side of the Alaska Airlines jet. The NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details about the incident.\n\nThe captain described \"an explosive experience\" and said he couldn't communicate with flight attendants, according to the documents. On the intercom, he heard flight attendants talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said as Tuesday's hearing began, speaking to anyone who may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nHomendy said seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nAmong the first witnesses called Tuesday was Elizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLund and others also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on production and worker experience. Spirit Senior Vice President Terry George said that just five years ago, 95% of its factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5%, and they must get more training in drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Lund added, most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military, but \"coming out of COVID ... we found that considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\" She said the company has improved training since the January accident.\n\nBut others remained skeptical. \"We have never been impressed with Boeing's training at all,\" International Association of Machinists' representative Lloyd Catlin said. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it's enough.\"\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

However, the company has said the work was not documented.\n\nDuring the two-day hearing, NTSB members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred. Board members are also expected to hear testimony from the company that manufactured the door plug, Spirit AeroSystems.\n\nTestimony is also expected from the International Association of Machinists and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nTuesday's hearing will focus on the production of Boeing 737 Max 9 planes and aircraft inspections.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nThe goal of the two-day hearing will be for the NTSB to complete its investigation and later make safety recommendations.\n\nThe incident occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet. Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression and a few cellphones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane. Passengers were terrified by the wind and roaring noise.\n\nDespite a loss of pressure in the cabin, none of the 171 passengers or six crew members died, and the plane landed safely back in Portland. Only eight people on the aircraft reported minor injuries.\n\nThe door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. Shortly before the door panel blowout, the airline had stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nBoeing has faced much scrutiny following the door plug incident, and the company has promised to improve its safety culture, including increasing inspections and improving employee training.\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing. Two months after the accident, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nAlso, effective this week, Boeing announced its new CEO Robert \"Kelly\" Ortberg will replace former CEO Dave Calhoun.\n\nEarlier this year, Calhoun faced pushback from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, with some accusing him of putting profits over safety.\n\nOrtberg will be the company's third chief executive in four and a half years.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019.\n\nBoeing also reported a $1.4 billion loss in revenue during its second quarter this year, which is around 10 times the loss it reported the same time last year.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news",

The NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details about the incident.\n\nThe captain described \"an explosive experience\" and said he couldn't communicate with flight attendants, according to the documents. On the intercom, he heard flight attendants talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said as Tuesday's hearing began, speaking to anyone who may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nHomendy said seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nAmong the first witnesses called Tuesday was Elizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLund and others also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on production and worker experience. Spirit Senior Vice President Terry George said that just five years ago, 95% of its factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5%, and they must get more training in drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Lund added, most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military, but \"coming out of COVID ... we found that considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\" She said the company has improved training since the January accident.\n\nBut others remained skeptical. \"We have never been impressed with Boeing's training at all,\" International Association of Machinists' representative Lloyd Catlin said. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it's enough.\"\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB.

Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few wireless phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's back yard in Cedar Hills, Ore.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, Homendy and the Arlington, Va.-based company got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4\u00bd years when Kelly Ortberg replaces the retiring Dave Calhoun.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices.

During the two-day hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously no one was injured.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

emergency on Boeing jet", "body": "New York: US investigators will on Tuesday open a two-day hearing into a near-catastrophic January incident on a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.\n\nVideo of the episode showed oxygen masks hanging in front of a gaping airplane space from a panel that blew out shortly after takeoff, leaving passengers exposed to open air at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.\n\nThe hearing in Washington aims \"to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident... and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" said the National Transportation Safety Board, which is overseeing the probe.\n\nread more Alaska Air says Boeing paid it $160 million in

take-off Alaska Air blowout on 737 Max seen as likely caused by manufacturing issue\n\nThe plane soon went back to Portland where it safely landed, although there were eight minor injuries.\n\nThe NTSB immediately launched a probe and after a month said four bolts securing the panel were missing, according to preliminary findings released February 6.\n\nThe agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington state prior to delivery of the aircraft last October.\n\nOver the course of two day-long sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, the NTSB will hear from about 15 witnesses.\n\nSpeakers include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\nThe witness list does not include Alaska Airlines.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after providing a detailed summary of the incident in June to journalists touring the company's Renton plant.\n\nBoeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after the arrived in Renton, but the issue \"did not create a safety hazard,\" Lund told reporters.\n\nBut when the fuselage panel, known as the door plug, was removed to replace the rivets, Boeing staff failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Lund said.\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Lund told reporters. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nShe also said Boeing was focused on closing a \"gap\" over the lack of documentation and that determining who did the work \"is the responsibility of the NTSB and that investigation is still going on.\"\n\nBoeing sanctioned\n\nAfter Lund's comments were published in June, the NTSB announced it was sanctioning the company for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nLund \"released non-public investigative information and made unsubstantiated speculations about possible causes of the Jan. 5 door-plug blowout, which is directly at issue in the ongoing investigation,\" the NTSB said in a June 27 letter to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.\n\nSome of the information \"was either inaccurate or unknown to the NTSB,\" the letter added. \"This disregard of the federal regulations and rules governing NTSB investigations cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF

One of those interviewed, identified only as \"Assembler Installer Doors B,\" told the investigator that the workload at the Boeing factory was too great to avoid mistakes from being made.\n\n\"As far as the workload, I feel like we were definitely trying to put out too much product, right?\" said the unidentified Boeing worker. \"That's how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast. I mean, I can't speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot.\"\n\nOne transcript showed that a Boeing employee, identified as a Door Master Lead, told investigators there planes required much of the work during the assembly process to be redone because of problems that are discovered, as happened with the door plug that was removed to fix some rivets. The worker said there was no special training to open, close, or remove a door plug versus a regular door.\n\nThat worker told the NTSB that his team was \"put in uncharted waters to where... we were replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear.\"\n\n\"The planes come in jacked up every day. Every day,\" the second worker added.\n\nOne FAA inspector at the Boeing factory told NTSB investigators that FAA inspectors have \"heard of pressure, [but] haven't been able to substantiate those claims.\"\n\nThe fuselage of the plane was manufactured by Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and it arrived at the Boeing factory with the four bolts in place, according to testimony at the hearing. But there were problems with the rivets by the door plug that needed to be repaired, so the door plug was removed so the work could be done. There were Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, but communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the floor of the Boeing factory wasn't good, according to another interview transcript released Tuesday.\n\n\"Well, basically we're the cockroaches of the factory,\" one unidentified Spirit employee told NTSB investigators.\n\nAnd a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory told investigators of problems of low employee morale and high turnover.\n\n\"We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,\" the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. \"What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn't coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they're being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of.\"\n\nThe January 5 Alaska Airlines flight had the door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. The incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious physical injuries. There were seven passengers and one flight attendant treated for injuries upon landing. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed.\n\nBut the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane, said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, in the opening comments of the hearing.\n\n\"Injuries we can't see, which we often don't talk about can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,\" she said. She offered an apology on behalf of the agency to the people on the flight.\n\nThe accident did serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control are facing the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing is Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nBut Homendy was clearly frustrated and ready to push back on Boeing in early testimony, telling Lund that \"this is not a PR campaign for Boeing.\" She said the hearing is being held to find out what was done ahead of the accident, not the tougher training and quality improvements made since then.\n\n\"You can talk about where we are today, but this is an investigation on what happened on January 5th,\" Homendy said.\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nCNN's Owen Dahlkamp, Danya Gainor, Celina Tebor, Nicki Brown, Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nAmong the scheduled witnesses is Elizabeth Lund, who has been Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, and officials from Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets.\n\nSpirit installed the door plug -- a panel that fills a space created for an extra exit on some planes -- on the Alaska Airlines jet, but the panel was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory near Seattle to repair rivets.\n\nThe NTSB's agenda for the hearing includes testimony about manufacturing and inspections, the opening and closing of the door plug in the Boeing factory, safety systems at Boeing and Spirit, and the FAA's supervision of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details about the incident.\n\nThe captain described \"an explosive experience\" and said he couldn't communicate with flight attendants, according to the documents. On the intercom, he heard flight attendants talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters).

That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nAmong the first witnesses called Tuesday was Elizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLund and others also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on production and worker experience. Spirit Senior Vice President Terry George said that just five years ago, 95% of its factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5%, and they must get more training in drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Lund added, most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military, but \"coming out of COVID ... we found that considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\" She said the company has improved training since the January accident.\n\nBut others remained skeptical. \"We have never been impressed with Boeing's training at all,\" International Association of Machinists' representative Lloyd Catlin said. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it's enough.\"\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights.

People try to work too fast,\" he told investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board. The installer, along with other workers, was not named in probe documents.\n\nThe panel that blew off the Boeing 737 Max in January was made and installed by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. It was removed at a Boeing factory so that workers could repair damaged rivets, but bolts that help secure the door plug weren't replaced. It's not clear who removed the panel.\n\nAnother member of the Boeing door crew said workers got no special training for door plugs and should not have been asked to open or close the panels.\n\nBoeing workers at the factory in Renton, Washington, have \"been put in uncharted waters to do everybody's dirty work because no one wants to touch it,\" the second worker told investigators. He said Boeing's safety culture is \"garbage. Nobody's accountable.\"\n\nThe workers' accounts were among more than 3,000 pages of documents released by the NTSB as it began a two-day hearing into the Jan. 5 accident, which left a gaping hole in the plane and created decompression so violent that it blew open the cockpit door and tore off the co-pilot's headset.\n\n\"It was chaos,\" the Alaska Airlines co-pilot told investigators.\n\nThe captain said it was so loud that he couldn't communicate with flight attendants. On an intercom, he heard them talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said as the hearing began. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing and Spirit executives said turnover since the coronavirus pandemic has left the companies with less-experienced workforces.\n\nElizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, said before the pandemic most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military. Now, she said, \"considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\"\n\nSpirit Senior Vice President Terry George said that five years ago, 95% of the company's factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5%. They company has increased training for tasks such as drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies, he said.\n\nA representative of the machinists' union said Boeing cut back on inspections and training over the last several years. Lund said the company has significantly increased training since the Alaska Airlines blowout, and that the company is trying to improve quality as it focuses on \"lean manufacturing.\"\n\n\"Can I make one suggestion?\" safety board member Todd Inman interjected.\n\n\"Sure, please,\" Lund replied.\n\n\"Stop talking about leaner and quality and start talking about safer manufacturing,\" Inman said.\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nBoeing production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the blowout and remains under 30 per month, Lund said. The Federal Aviation Administration has set a limit of 38 per month until it is satisfied that Boeing's manufacturing process is producing safe planes.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses were expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.", "source": {"uri": "cp24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse24.com                        "}, "authors": [{"uri":

During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\n\"The NTSB wants to fill in the gaps of what is known about this incident and to put people on the record about it,\" said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. The agency will be looking to underscore Boeing's failures in following the process it had told the Federal Aviation Administration it was going to use in such cases, he said.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nThe first witnesses called Tuesday included Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased. but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the opening and closing of the door plug and the FAA's oversight of Boeing.\n\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries. Homendy said Tuesday that seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. Goglia, the former safety board member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nTension remains high between the NTSB and Boeing, however. Two months after the accident, board Chair Jennifer Homendy and Boeing got into a public argument over whether the company was cooperating with investigators.\n\nThat spat was largely smoothed over, but in June a Boeing executive angered the board by discussing the investigation with reporters and -- even worse in the agency's view -- suggesting that the NTSB was interested in finding someone to blame for the blowout.\n\nNTSB officials see their role as identifying the cause of accidents to prevent similar ones in the future. They are not prosecutors, and they fear that witnesses won't come forward if they think NTSB is looking for culprits.\n\nSo the NTSB issued a subpoena for Boeing representatives while stripping the company of its customary right to ask questions during the hearing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 1/2 years.\n\nTestimony from NTSB hearings is not admissible in court, but lawyers suing Boeing over this and other accidents will be watching, knowing that they can seek depositions from witnesses to cover the same ground.\n\n\"Our cases are already solid -- door plugs shouldn't blow out during a flight,\" said one of those lawyers, Mark Lindquist of Seattle. \"Our cases grow even stronger, however, if the blowout was the result of habitually shoddy practices. Are jurors going to see this as negligence or something worse?\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

One of those interviewed, identified only as \"Assembler Installer Doors B,\" told the investigator that the workload at the Boeing factory was too great to avoid mistakes from being made.\n\n\"As far as the workload, I feel like we were definitely trying to put out too much product, right?\" said the unidentified Boeing worker. \"That's how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast. I mean, I can't speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot.\"\n\nAnother worker, identified as a Door Master Lead, said that their team was \"put in uncharted waters to where... we were replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear.\"\n\n\"The planes come in jacked up every day. Every day,\" the second worker added.\n\nOne FAA inspector at the Boeing factory told NTSB investigators that FAA inspectors have \"heard of pressure, [but] haven't been able to substantiate those claims.\"\n\nThe fuselage of the plane was manufactured by Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and it arrived at the Boeing factory with the four bolts in place, according to testimony at the hearing. But there were problems with the rivets by the door plug that needed to be repaired, so the door plug was removed so the work could be done. There were Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, but communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the floor of the Boeing factory wasn't good, according to another interview transcript released Tuesday.\n\n\"Well, basically we're the cockroaches of the factory,\" one unidentified Spirit employee told NTSB investigators.\n\nAnd a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory told investigators of problems of low employee morale and high turnover.\n\n\"We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,\" the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. \"What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn't coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they're being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of.\"\n\nThe January 5 Alaska Airlines flight had the door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. The incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious physical injuries. There were seven passengers and one flight attendant treated for injuries upon landing. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed.\n\nBut the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane, said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, in the opening comments of the hearing.\n\n\"Injuries we can't see, which we often don't talk about can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,\" she said. She offered an apology on behalf of the agency to the people on the flight.\n\nThe accident did serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control are facing the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing is Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe NTSB is asking how the Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug was removed and reinstalled without critical bolts. The NTSB is also seeking answers about the \"lack of documentation\" on the factory floor, as well as changes the manufacturing Goliath implemented after the incident.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nA final report is still months away.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends on Wednesday, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.\n\nCNN's Owen Dahlkamp, Danya Gainor, Celine Tabor, Nicki Brown, Ramisha Maruf contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

People try to work too fast,\" he told investigators for the National Transportation Safety Board. The installer, along with other workers, was not named in probe documents.\n\nThe panel that blew off the Boeing 737-9 Max in January was made and installed by a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems. It was removed at a Boeing factory so that workers could repair damaged rivets, but bolts that help secure the door plug weren't replaced. It's not clear who removed the panel.\n\nAnother member of the Boeing door crew said workers got no special training for door plugs and should not have been asked to open or close the panels.\n\nBoeing workers at the factory in Renton, Washington, have \"been put in uncharted waters to do everybody's dirty work because no one wants to touch it,\" the second worker told investigators. He said Boeing's safety culture is \"garbage. Nobody's accountable.\"\n\nThe workers' accounts were among more than 3,000 pages of documents released by the National Transportation Safety Board as it began a two-day hearing into the Jan. 5 accident, which left a gaping hole in the plane and created decompression so violent that it blew open the cockpit door and tore off the co-pilot's headset.\n\n\"It was chaos,\" the Alaska Airlines co-pilot told investigators.\n\nThe captain said it was so loud that he couldn't communicate with flight attendants. On an intercom, he heard them talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe accident on Flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet. Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said as the hearing began. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing and Spirit executives said turnover since the coronavirus pandemic has left the companies with less-experienced workforces.\n\nElizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February, said before the pandemic most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military. Now, she said, \"considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\"\n\nSpirit senior vice president Terry George said that five years ago, 95% of the company's factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5%. The company has increased training for tasks such as drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies, he said.\n\nA representative of the machinists' union said Boeing cut back on inspections and training over the last several years. Lund said the company has significantly increased training since the Alaska Airlines blowout, and that the company is trying to improve quality as it focuses on \"lean manufacturing.\"\n\n\"Can I make one suggestion?\" safety board member Todd Inman interjected.\n\n\"Sure, please,\" Lund replied.\n\n\"Stop talking about leaner and quality and start talking about safer manufacturing,\" Inman said.\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nBoeing production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the blowout and remains under 30 per month, Lund said. The Federal Aviation Administration has set a limit of 38 per month until it is satisfied that Boeing's manufacturing process is producing safe planes.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses were expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe accident led to several investigations of Boeing, most of which are still underway.\n\nThe FBI has told passengers on the Alaska Airlines flight that they might be victims of a crime. The Justice Department pushed Boeing to plead guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud after finding that it failed to live up to a previous settlement related to regulatory approval of the Max.\n\nBoeing, which has yet to recover financially from two deadly crashes of Max jets in 2018 and 2019, has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019. Later this week, the company will get its third chief executive in 4 and a half years.", "source": {"uri": "travelweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Boeing has promised to make significant quality improvements.\n\nThe NTSB also released 3,800 pages of factual reports and interviews from the ongoing investigation.\n\nBoeing has said no paperwork exists to document the removal of four key missing bolts. Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory, which says in big letters, \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened\". It also has new required procedures if the door plug needs to be opened during production.\n\nA flight attendant described the moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nLund and Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing, are testifying on Tuesday during the hearings scheduled to last 20 hours over two days. Ackerman said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial aeroplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nLund said on Tuesday that Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly MAX production - far fewer MAXs than the 38 per month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point, I think we were as low as eight,\" Lund told the NTSB.\n\nTerry George, senior vice president and general manager for the Boeing programme at Spirit AeroSystems, and Scott Grabon, a senior director for 737 quality at Spirit, which makes the fuselage for the MAX, also testified on Tuesday.\n\nLast month Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7bn in stock.\n\nThe hearing is reviewing issues including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\nIn June, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said the agency was \"too hands-off\" in its oversight of Boeing before January. FAA employees told the NTSB that Boeing employees did not always follow required processes.\n\nJonathan Arnold, aviation safety inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing's factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nLund said before the January 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing had defects - but the key is making sure they are manageable. \"What we don't want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\" Lund said. \"We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues, I will tell you, right around the time of the accident.\"\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy at one point expressed frustration with Boeing. \"This isn't a PR campaign for Boeing,\" she said, urging the company to make clear what its policies were before the incident.\n\nThe interviews also addressed questions of factory culture, which has been under fire in congressional hearings. Whistleblowers have alleged that Boeing retaliated against people coming forward with safety concerns on the factory floor.\n\nBoeing executive Carole Murray described various problems with fuselages coming from Spirit AeroSystems in the run-up to the accident. \"We had defects. Sealant was one of our biggest defects that we had write-ups on,\" she said. \"We had multiple escapements around the window frame, skin defects.\"\n\nMichelle Delgado, a structures mechanic who worked as a contractor at Boeing and did the rework on the Alaska MAX 9 aircraft, told NTSB the workload is heavy and requires working long hours.\n\n\"When we're very overwhelmed with work, it is pressing because with everything we've cut down on some personnel, so now it's like in order for me to not have to deal with a worse situation tomorrow, I'd rather work a 12 to 13-hour shift to get it all done, for my sake, so I don't have to deal with people the next day.\"\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least $243.6m to resolve a US Department of Justice investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

on Boeing jet", "body": "A two-day hearing is set to investigate what happened on a January 5 Alaska Airlines flight in which a panel on the fuselage of a 737 MAX blew out mid-flight\n\nUS investigators will on Tuesday open a two-day hearing into a near-catastrophic January incident on a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.\n\nVideo of the episode showed oxygen masks hanging in front of a gaping airplane space from a panel that blew out shortly after takeoff, leaving passengers exposed to open air at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.\n\nThe hearing in Washington aims \"to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident... and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" said the National Transportation Safety Board, which is overseeing the probe.\n\nThe plane soon went back to Portland where it safely landed, although there were eight minor injuries.\n\nThe NTSB immediately launched a probe and after a month said four bolts securing the panel were missing, according to preliminary findings released February 6.\n\nThe agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington state prior to delivery of the aircraft last October.\n\nOver the course of two day-long sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, the NTSB will hear from about 15 witnesses.\n\nSpeakers include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\nThe witness list does not include Alaska Airlines.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after providing a detailed summary of the incident in June to journalists touring the company's Renton plant.\n\nBoeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after the arrived in Renton, but the issue \"did not create a safety hazard,\" Lund told reporters.\n\nBut when the fuselage panel, known as the door plug, was removed to replace the rivets, Boeing staff failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Lund said.\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Lund told reporters. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nShe also said Boeing was focused on closing a \"gap\" over the lack of documentation and that determining who did the work \"is the responsibility of the NTSB and that investigation is still going on.\"\n\n- Boeing sanctioned -\n\nAfter Lund's comments were published in June, the NTSB announced it was sanctioning the company for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has sharply criticized Boeing's responsiveness during the probe\n\nLund \"released non-public investigative information and made unsubstantiated speculations about possible causes of the Jan. 5 door-plug blowout, which is directly at issue in the ongoing investigation,\" the NTSB said in a June 27 letter to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.\n\nSome of the information \"was either inaccurate or unknown to the NTSB,\" the letter added. \"This disregard of the federal regulations and rules governing NTSB investigations cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type":

One of those interviewed, identified only as \"Assembler Installer Doors B,\" told the investigator that the workload at the Boeing factory was too great to avoid mistakes from being made.\n\n\"As far as the workload, I feel like we were definitely trying to put out too much product, right?\" said the unidentified Boeing worker. \"That's how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast. I mean, I can't speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot.\"\n\nOne FAA inspector at the Boeing factory told NTSB investigators that FAA inspectors have \"heard of pressure, [but] haven't been able to substantiate those claims.\"\n\nThe fuselage of the plane was manufactured by Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and it arrived at the Boeing factory with the four bolts in place, according to testimony at the hearing. But there were problems with the rivets by the door plug that needed to be repaired, so the door plug was removed so the work could be done. There were Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, but communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the floor of the Boeing factory wasn't good, according to another interview transcript released Tuesday.\n\n\"Well, basically we're the cockroaches of the factory,\" one unidentified Spirit employee told NTSB investigators.\n\nAnd a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory told investigators of problems of low employee morale and high turnover.\n\n\"We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,\" the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. \"What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn't coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they're being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of.\"\n\nThe January 5 Alaska Airlines flight had the door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. The incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious physical injuries. There were seven passengers and one flight attendant treated for injuries upon landing. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed.\n\nBut the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane, said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, in the opening comments of the hearing.\n\n\"Injuries we can't see, which we often don't talk about can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,\" she said. She offered an apology on behalf of the agency to the people on the flight.\n\nThe accident did serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control are facing the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing isDoug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe NTSB is asking how the Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug was removed and reinstalled without critical bolts. The NTSB is also seeking answers about the \"lack of documentation\" on the factory floor, as well as changes the manufacturing Goliath implemented after the incident.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nA final report is still months away.\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed therivetsdidn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends on Wednesday, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.\n\nCNN's Owen Dahlkamp, Danya Gainor, Celine Tabor, Nicki Brown, Ramisha Maruf contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

One of those interviewed, identified only as \"Assembler Installer Doors B,\" told the investigator that the workload at the Boeing factory was too great to avoid mistakes from being made.\n\n\"As far as the workload, I feel like we were definitely trying to put out too much product, right?\" said the unidentified Boeing worker. \"That's how mistakes are made. People try to work too fast. I mean, I can't speak for anybody else, but we were busy. We were working a lot.\"\n\nOne FAA inspector at the Boeing factory told NTSB investigators that FAA inspectors have \"heard of pressure, [but] haven't been able to substantiate those claims.\"\n\nThe fuselage of the plane was manufactured by Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems, and it arrived at the Boeing factory with the four bolts in place, according to testimony at the hearing. But there were problems with the rivets by the door plug that needed to be repaired, so the door plug was removed so the work could be done. There were Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, but communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the floor of the Boeing factory wasn't good, according to another interview transcript released Tuesday.\n\n\"Well, basically we're the cockroaches of the factory,\" one unidentified Spirit employee told NTSB investigators.\n\nAnd a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory told investigators of problems of low employee morale and high turnover.\n\n\"We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,\" the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. \"What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn't coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they're being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of.\"\n\nThe January 5 Alaska Airlines flight had the door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. The incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious physical injuries. There were seven passengers and one flight attendant treated for injuries upon landing. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed.\n\nBut the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane, said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, in the opening comments of the hearing.\n\n\"Injuries we can't see, which we often don't talk about can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,\" she said. She offered an apology on behalf of the agency to the people on the flight.\n\nThe accident did serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control are facing the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing is Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe NTSB is asking how the Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug was removed and reinstalled without critical bolts. The NTSB is also seeking answers about the \"lack of documentation\" on the factory floor, as well as changes the manufacturing Goliath implemented after the incident.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nA final report is still months away.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends on Wednesday, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.\n\nCNN's Owen Dahlkamp, Danya Gainor, Celine Tabor, Nicki Brown, Ramisha Maruf contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

There were Spirit employees at the Boeing plant, but communication between the Boeing and Spirit workers on the floor of the Boeing factory wasn't good, according to another interview transcript released Tuesday.\n\n\"Well, basically we're the cockroaches of the factory,\" one unidentified Spirit employee told NTSB investigators.\n\nAnd a Boeing team captain at the 737 factory told investigators of problems of low employee morale and high turnover.\n\n\"We have a lot of turnover specifically because, you know, this can be a stressful job, you know,\" the Boeing team captain is quoted as saying in one of the transcripts. \"What the company wants and what we have the skills and capabilities to perform at the time sometimes that doesn't coincide, and so some people get disgruntled; they feel like they're being overworked; they feel like, you know, that we might be getting taken advantage of.\"\n\n'Injuries we can't see'\n\nThe January 5 Alaska Airlines flight had the door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. The incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious physical injuries. There were seven passengers and one flight attendant treated for injuries upon landing. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed.\n\nBut the trauma of being on the flight likely affected many of those aboard the plane, said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB, in the opening comments of the hearing.\n\n\"Injuries we can't see, which we often don't talk about can have profound and lasting impacts on lives and livelihoods,\" she said. She offered an apology on behalf of the agency to the people on the flight.\n\nThe accident did serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control are facing the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing is Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nA final report is still months away.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nCNN's Owen Dahlkamp, Danya Gainor, Celine Tabor, Nicki Brown, Ramisha Maruf contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nDoug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial airplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nLund said today Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly MAX production - far fewer MAXs than the 38 per month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point I think we were as low as eight,\" Lund told the NTSB.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems , whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7 billion in stock.\n\nThe hearings are reviewing key issues, including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\nFUSELAGE DEFECTS\n\nJonathan Arnold, Aviation Safety Inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing's factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nLund said before the Jan. 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing by Spirit AeroSystems had defects. \"What we don't want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\" Lund said. \"We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues, I will tell you, right around the time of the accident.\"\n\nHomendy at one point expressed frustration with Boeing. \"The safety culture needs a lot of work (at Boeing),\" she said. \"There's not a lot of trust, there's a lot of distrust within the workforce.\"\n\nBoeing executive Carole Murray described various problems with fuselages coming from Spirit AeroSystems in the run-up to the accident. \"We had defects. Sealant was one of our biggest defects that we had write-ups on,\" she said. \"We had multiple escapements around the window frame, skin defects.\"\n\nMichelle Delgado, a structures mechanic who worked as a contractor at Boeing and did the rework on the Alaska MAX 9 aircraft, told NTSB the workload is heavy and requires working long hours.\n\n\"In order for me to not have to deal with a worse situation tomorrow, I'd rather work a 12 to 13-hour shift to get it all done, for my sake, so I don't have to deal with people the next day,\" he told NTSB.\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least $243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.", "source": {"uri": "staradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Honolulu

What should you expect?", "body": "WASHINGTON -- The flying public can expect more details about what caused a panel to explode off a Boeing 737 MAX plane earlier this year as the top U.S. aviation investigator presents evidence and testimony on the near-disaster during a two-day hearing.\n\nBoeing executives will appear before the National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday and Wednesday for a fact-finding hearing, part of the NTSB's monthslong investigation into what went wrong.\n\nThe hearing will focus on Boeing's production and inspection processes, as well as workforce training at the aerospace giant and documentation meant to track airplane parts as 737s move through Boeing's Renton factory. Investigators will also share what they know about the circumstances leading up to the Jan. 5 blowout over Portland.\n\nThe panel, known as a door plug, which fills a hole left for an extra emergency exit installed in some aircraft, blew off as an Alaska Airlines flight was climbing into the sky out of Portland. The plane landed safely, with some passengers reporting non-life-threatening injuries and distress.\n\nBut Boeing narrowly avoided a catastrophic disaster. If the blowout had occurred later in the flight when the plane was at a higher altitude, or if passengers had been sitting in the seats closest to the door plug, the incident could have been deadly.\n\nThe NTSB has already released some preliminary findings that, so far, indicate that things went wrong in Boeing's Renton factory.\n\nBefore heading to Renton by train, the fuselage of the plane was assembled at Spirit AeroSystems, a Boeing supplier based in Wichita, Kan. Spirit has also come under scrutiny for manufacturing defects, and Boeing recently secured a deal to buy the troubled manufacturer in an effort to revitalize both companies.\n\nIn Renton, the NTSB found, Boeing mechanics partially removed the door plug to complete other work on the plane.\n\nOut-of-order work, which allows mechanics to move planes through its factory lines before completing all jobs in the standard order, was common at Boeing at the time. It kept production rates up, but also increased the risk of mistakes as workers take parts on and off planes.\n\nIn the case of the door plug, Boeing workers reinstalled the panel but did not properly install four bolts meant to hold the plug in place. It's likely the bolts were not installed at all.\n\nThe plane flew for two months without the bolts, before the door plug came loose in January.\n\nFollowing that incident, Boeing's airline customers, including Alaska and United Airlines, inspected the rest of their Boeing 737 MAX 9 fleets and discovered other planes with loose bolts.\n\nIt's not clear who should have been responsible for putting them back on. Boeing has said it doesn't have any record of the work being done.\n\nThe lack of documentation will be a topic of scrutiny at the NTSB hearing. The board intends to examine what processes Boeing has in place, how they are supposed to work, and what went wrong in this instance.\n\nThe board will also discuss mechanisms for employees to report safety concerns and how Boeing makes the decision to stop a plane from moving forward in the factory based on those reports. On the second day, the NTSB will examine Boeing's safety management system and the Federal Aviation Administration's oversight of the company.\n\nBoeing's senior vice president of quality, Elizabeth Lund, is expected to testify, as is Doug Ackerman, the vice president of supplier quality; Paul Wright, senior director for Boeing's safety management system; and Hector Silva, director of quality.\n\nSeveral Spirit AeroSystems executives will also testify, as well as members of the FAA and a representative from the International Association of Machinists, which represents Boeing employees.\n\nThe door plug blowout reignited scrutiny about two fatal crashes involving Boeing's 737 MAX five years ago.\n\nIn those incidents, an error with a then-new software system on the MAX led to two crashes that killed 346 people. Boeing recently pleaded guilty to misleading safety regulators about that software system, affecting the certification of that new model.

The NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details about the incident.\n\nThe captain described \"an explosive experience\" and said he couldn't communicate with flight attendants, according to the documents. On the intercom, he heard flight attendants talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Ore.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Ore., as the plane flew at 16,000 feet. Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cellphones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but there were no major injuries.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said as Tuesday's hearing began, speaking to anyone who may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nHomendy said seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is called a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nAmong the first witnesses called Tuesday was Elizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLund and others also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on production and worker experience. Spirit senior vice president Terry George said that just five years ago, 95 percent of its factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5 percent, and they must get more training in drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Lund added, most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military, but \"coming out of COVID ... we found that considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\" She said the company has improved training since the January accident.\n\nBut others remained skeptical. \"We have never been impressed with Boeing's training at all,\" International Association of Machinists' representative Lloyd Catlin said. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it's enough.\"\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com",

Jennifer Buchanan / POOL / AFP\n\nUS investigators will on Tuesday open a two-day hearing into a near-catastrophic January incident on a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.\n\nVideo of the episode showed oxygen masks hanging in front of a gaping airplane space from a panel that blew out shortly after takeoff, leaving passengers exposed to open air at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.\n\nThe hearing in Washington aims \"to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident... and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" said the National Transportation Safety Board, which is overseeing the probe.\n\nThe plane soon went back to Portland where it safely landed, although there were eight minor injuries.\n\nThe NTSB immediately launched a probe and after a month said four bolts securing the panel were missing, according to preliminary findings released February 6.\n\nThe agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington state prior to delivery of the aircraft last October.\n\nOver the course of two day-long sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, the NTSB will hear from about 15 witnesses.\n\nSpeakers include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\nThe witness list does not include Alaska Airlines.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after providing a detailed summary of the incident in June to journalists touring the company's Renton plant.\n\nBoeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after the arrived in Renton, but the issue \"did not create a safety hazard,\" Lund told reporters.\n\nBut when the fuselage panel, known as the door plug, was removed to replace the rivets, Boeing staff failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Lund said.\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Lund told reporters. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nShe also said Boeing was focused on closing a \"gap\" over the lack of documentation and that determining who did the work \"is the responsibility of the NTSB and that investigation is still going on.\"\n\nAfter Lund's comments were published in June, the NTSB announced it was sanctioning the company for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nLund \"released non-public investigative information and made unsubstantiated speculations about possible causes of the Jan. 5 door-plug blowout, which is directly at issue in the ongoing investigation,\" the NTSB said in a June 27 letter to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.\n\nSome of the information \"was either inaccurate or unknown to the NTSB,\" the letter added. \"This disregard of the federal regulations and rules governing NTSB investigations cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"},

Four bolts that helped secure the panel, called a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company said the work was not documented, the government agency found in a preliminary report.\n\nThe captain of the Alaska Airlines described \"an explosive experience\" and said he could not communicate with flight attendants, according to the documents. The pilots quickly landed the aircraft back in Portland, Oregon, and the door plug was later found in a backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon. Seven passengers and a single fight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\n\"Quite traumatic\"\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in the hearing. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event,\" she added, speaking to anyone who may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard.\n\nHomendy and other NTSB members pressed executives from Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for Max jets, to explain what may have led up the incident and what steps the companies have taken to ensure safety.\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing. What I want to know, what we want to know, is what happened in March, April, May, June, July, August, September, leading up to this, leading up to what happened in January?\" Homendy said.\n\nWitnesses for Boeing and Spirit defended the companies' respective safety systems and inspection practices.\n\n\"Every fuselage goes through a final product verification which is a dedicated area in the Spirit factory where we have Boeing inspectors,\" Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing commercial airplanes, told the panel, describing a change in procedure that began March 1.\n\nThe inspections involve \"going over the fuselage front to back, inside and outside to identify any discrepancy,\" said Ackerman, and typically take a couple of days. Boeing takes ownership of the fuselage as it exits the Spirit factory in Wichita, Kansas, he added.\n\n\"We want to have acceptance verification at the location where it is manufactured,\" Ackerman said.\n\nThe NTSB will not determine what caused the blowout after the hearing -- that could take another year or longer. Rather, the federal agency is calling the unusually long hearing a fact-finding step.\n\nDesign changes planned\n\nElizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position as of Febuary -- said in the hearing that the company hopes to have a fix in place within the year to potentially prevent such a blowout from happening again.\n\n\"They are working on some design changes that will allow the door plug to not be closed if there's any issue until it's firmly secured,\" Lund said in responding to questions as to why Boeing did not have a warning system for door plugs akin to what's in place for regular doors.\n\nThe NTSB in June found Boeing had broken investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nBoeing in July agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay at least $243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department probe into two 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people.\n\nStill in crisis mode, Boeing's stock has shed more than a third of its value this year, with the company hemorrhaging cash amid its greatly reduced production.\n\nLund said production of Max jets declined to under 10 a month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains at less than 30 a month.\n\nBoeing announced a new CEO last week, and has agreed to repurchase Spirit to get better control of its manufacturing.\n\n-- CBS News' Kris Van Cleave and Kathryn Krupnik, along with the Associated Press, contributed to this report.\n\nHurricane Debby rainfall \"means obliteration\" for

to probe Alaska Airlines emergency on Boeing jet", "body": "NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy has sharply criticized Boeing's responsiveness during the probe\n\nUS investigators will on Tuesday open a two-day hearing into a near-catastrophic January incident on a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.\n\nVideo of the episode showed oxygen masks hanging in front of a gaping airplane space from a panel that blew out shortly after takeoff, leaving passengers exposed to open air at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.\n\nThe hearing in Washington aims \"to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident... and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" said the National Transportation Safety Board, which is overseeing the probe.\n\nThe plane soon went back to Portland where it safely landed, although there were eight minor injuries.\n\nThe NTSB immediately launched a probe and after a month said four bolts securing the panel were missing, according to preliminary findings released February 6.\n\nThe agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington state prior to delivery of the aircraft last October.\n\nOver the course of two day-long sessions on Tuesday and Wednesday in Washington, the NTSB will hear from about 15 witnesses.\n\nSpeakers include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\nThe witness list does not include Alaska Airlines.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after providing a detailed summary of the incident in June to journalists touring the company's Renton plant.\n\nBoeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after

said in a June 27 letter to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.\n\nSome of the information \"was either inaccurate or unknown to the NTSB,\" the letter added.\n\n\"This disregard of the federal regulations and rules governing NTSB investigations cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was

NTSB,\" the letter added. \"This disregard of the federal regulations and rules governing NTSB investigations cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.\n\nelm-jmb/bjt\n\nMore from this section\n\nGoogle illegally maintains monopoly over internet search, judge rules\n\nReformed Gangster Disciples Boss, Harold

A door-sized section near the rear of the Boeing 737-9 MAX plane blew off 10 minutes after Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 took off from Portland, Oregon on January 5 on its way to Ontario, California.\n\nCNN --\n\nThe public already knows a lot about the January 5 Alaska Airlines flight that had a door plug blow out of the side of a Boeing 737 Max as it approached 16,000 feet. On Tuesday, we could find out a lot more.\n\nThe incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious injuries. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed. The accident did do serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nOne of those investigations is being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal regulator that investigates all manner of accidents, from railroad derailments to some car crashes to virtually all plane crashes.\n\nThe NTSB is scheduled to hold 20 hours of public hearings about the Alaska Airlines incident spread over two days, starting Tuesday morning. It will begin by making public a docket of more than 60 documents running more than 3,800 pages that have been collected in the seven months since the accident.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control will then face the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund, according to a new agenda posted by the NTSB. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing will be Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe NTSB will ask how the Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug was removed and reinstalled without critical bolts before the plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines. The NTSB will also ask about the \"lack of documentation\" on the factory floor, according to the agenda, as well as changes the manufacturing Goliath implemented after the incident.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nA final report is still months away.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends on Wednesday, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends on Wednesday, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nDoug Ackerman, vice-president of supplier quality for Boeing said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial airplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nLund said on Tuesday Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly MAX production - far fewer MAXs than the 38 per month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point I think we were as low as eight,\" Lund told the NTSB.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for US$4.7 billion in stock.\n\nThe hearings are reviewing key issues, including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\nFuselage defects\n\nJonathan Arnold, Aviation Safety Inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing's factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nLund said before the Jan 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing by Spirit AeroSystems had defects.\n\n\"What we don't want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\" Lund said. \"We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues, I will tell you, right around the time of the accident.\"\n\nHomendy at one point expressed frustration with Boeing. \"The safety culture needs a lot of work (at Boeing),\" she said. \"There's not a lot of trust, there's a lot of distrust within the workforce.\"\n\nBoeing executive Carole Murray described various problems with fuselages coming from Spirit AeroSystems in the run-up to the accident. \"We had defects. Sealant was one of our biggest defects that we had write-ups on,\" she said. \"We had multiple escapements around the window frame, skin defects.\"\n\nMichelle Delgado, a structures mechanic who worked as a contractor at Boeing and did the rework on the Alaska MAX 9 aircraft, told NTSB the workload is heavy and requires working long hours.\n\n\"In order for me to not have to deal with a worse situation tomorrow, I'd rather work a 12 to 13-hour shift to get it all done, for my sake, so I don't have to deal with people the next day,\" he told NTSB.\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least US$243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.

Boeing has vowed to make key quality improvements.\n\nThe board also released 3,800 pages of factual reports and interviews from the ongoing investigation.\n\nBoeing has said no paperwork exists to document the removal of four key missing bolts. Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\" It also has new required procedures if the door plug needs to be opened during production.\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nLund and Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing, are testifying Tuesday during the hearings scheduled to last 20 hours over two days. Ackerman said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial airplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nLund said Tuesday Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly MAX production -- far fewer MAXs than the 38 per month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point I think we were as low as eight,\" Lund told the NTSB.\n\nTerry George, senior vice president and general manager for Boeing Program at Spirit AeroSystems, and Scott Grabon, a senior director for 737 quality at Spirit, which makes the fuselage for the MAX, also testified Tuesday.\n\nLast month Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7 billion in stock.\n\nThe hearing is reviewing issues including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\nFuselage defects\n\nIn June, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said the agency was \"too hands off\" in its oversight of Boeing before January. FAA employees told the NTSB that Boeing employees did not always followed required processes.\n\nJonathan Arnold, Aviation Safety Inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing's factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nLund said before the Jan. 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing had defects - but the key is making sure they are manageable. \"What we don't want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\" Lund said. \"We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues, I will tell you, right around the time of the accident.\"\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy at one point expressed frustration with Boeing. \"This isn't a PR campaign for Boeing,\" she said, urging the company to make clear what its policies were before the incident.\n\nThe interviews also addressed questions of factory culture, which has been under fire in congressional hearings. Whistleblowers have alleged that Boeing retaliated against people coming forward with safety concerns on the factory floor.\n\nBoeing executive Carole Murray described various problems with fuselages coming from Spirit AeroSystems in the run-up to the accident. \"We had defects. Sealant was one of our biggest defects that we had write-ups on,\" she said. \"We had multiple escapements around the window frame, skin defects.\"\n\nMichelle Delgado, a structures mechanic who worked as a contractor at Boeing and did the rework on the Alaska MAX 9 aircraft, told NTSB the workload is heavy and requires working long hours.\n\n\"When we're very overwhelmed with work, it is pressing because with everything we've cut down on some personnel, so now it's like in order for me to not have to deal with a worse situation tomorrow, I'd rather work a 12 to 13-hour shift to get it all done, for my sake, so I don't have to deal with people the next day.\"\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least $243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department

Lund told the panel that Boeing door staff would have been authorized to open or close the door plug.\n\nLund told the panel that the \"primary\" place to identify the lapse would have been through such documentation, \"open paperwork, which we don't believe existed.\"\n\nSumming up this issue later, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy asked Lund late Tuesday afternoon, \"We do not know specifically when this door plug ... We do not know by whom.\"\n\n\"Correct,\" Lund responded.\n\nThe two-day hearing continues Wednesday, with sessions involving Boeing's quality management and oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nHomendy said the hearing should focus on unanswered questions and Boeing's operations before the Alaska Airlines incident rather than steps Boeing has taken in the aftermath.\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing,\" said NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. \"What I want to know, what we want to know, is what happened\" in the period before January 5.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after discussing the probe in a Boeing-hosted tour of Renton, with the agency sanctioning Boeing for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nHomendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.\n\nLund acknowledged the need for better communications and the simplification of some procedures at Boeing, but stressed that the company was committed to improving.\n\nLund recounted a quality \"stand down\" in which some 70,000 workers took an eight-hour work day to review safety policies. The company took 30,000 recommendations of employee feedback on \"how we can improve quality or product safety.\"\n\nBut prior to the January 5 incident Boeing's \"training was in really bad shape,\" said Lloyd Catlin, of the International Association of Machinists. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it is enough.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times AU"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_biers@ibtimes.com.au", "name": "John Biers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rivet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Renton_Factory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Renton Factory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Machinists_and_Aerospace_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Home_Improvement", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Home Improvement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1856057/two-day-hearing-set-investigate-what-happened-january-5-alaska-airlines-flight-which-panel.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1350, "textEnd": 1362}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-19", "textStart": 1392, "textEnd": 1404}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 3136, "textEnd": 3145, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, we could find out a lot more.\n\nThe incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious injuries. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed. The accident did do serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nOne of those investigations is being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal regulator that investigates all manner of accidents, from railroad derailments to some car crashes to virtually all plane crashes.\n\nThe NTSB is scheduled to hold 20 hours of public hearings about the Alaska Airlines incident spread over two days, starting Tuesday morning. It will begin by making public a docket of more than 60 documents running more than 3,800 pages that have been collected in the seven months since the accident.\n\nBoeing executives in charge of quality control will then face the safety board for questions, including Boeing Commercial Airplanes' senior vice president of quality Elizabeth Lund, according to a new agenda posted by the NTSB. Alongside Lund for half of Tuesday's hearing will be Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nThe NTSB will ask how the Boeing 737 MAX 9 door plug was removed and reinstalled without critical bolts before the plane was delivered to Alaska Airlines. The NTSB will also ask about the \"lack of documentation\" on the factory floor, according to the agenda, as well as changes the manufacturing Goliath implemented after the incident.\n\nThe rare, two-day-long investigative hearing is key to closing the case on the January 5 incident, which led to a 19-day-long grounding of 737 MAX 9s in the United States. The NTSB says it will \"use the information gathered to complete the investigation, determine probable cause, and make recommendations to improve transportation safety.\"\n\nA final report is still months away.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nBut the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends on Wednesday, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Boeing has vowed to make key quality improvements.\n\nBoeing's senior vice-president for quality, Elizabeth Lund, and Doug Ackerman, vice-president of supplier quality for Boeing, are testifying on Tuesday during the hearings scheduled to last 20 hours over two days. Ackerman said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial airplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nLund said on Tuesday Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly MAX production - far fewer MAXs than the 38 per month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point I think we were as low as eight,\" Lund told the NTSB.\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nTerry George, senior vice-president and general manager for Boeing Program at Spirit AeroSystems, and Scott Grabon, a senior director for 737 quality at Spirit, which makes the fuselage for the MAX, also testified on Tuesday.\n\nLast month Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for US$4.7 billion in stock.\n\nThe hearing is reviewing issues including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\n'Too hands off'\n\nBoeing has said no paperwork exists to document the removal of four key missing bolts. Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nIn June, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said the agency was \"too hands off\" in its oversight of Boeing before January. FAA employees told the NTSB that Boeing employees did not always followed required processes.\n\nJonathan Arnold, Aviation Safety Inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing's factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nLund said before the Jan five accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing had defects - but the key is making sure they are manageable. \"What we don't want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\" Lund said. \"We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues. I will tell you right around the time of the accident.\"\n\nThe interviews also addressed questions of factory culture, which has been under fire in congressional hearings. Whistleblowers have alleged that Boeing retaliated against people coming forward with safety concerns on the factory floor.\n\nBoeing executive Carole Murray described various problems with fuselages coming from Spirit AeroSystems in the run-up to the accident. \"We had defects. Sealant was one of our biggest defects that we had write-ups on,\" she said. \"We had multiple escapements around the window frame, skin defects.\"\n\nMichelle Delgado, a structures mechanic who worked as a contractor at Boeing and did the rework on the Alaska MAX 9 aircraft, told NTSB the workload is heavy and requires working long hours.\n\n\"When we're very overwhelmed with work, it is pressing because with everything we've cut down on some personnel, so now it's like in order for me to not have to deal with a worse situation tomorrow, I'd rather work a 12 to 13-hour shift to get it all done, for my sake, so I don't have to deal with people the next day.\"\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least US$243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.

UrduPoint", "body": "New York, (APP - UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Aug, 2024) US investigators will on Tuesday open a two-day hearing into a near-catastrophic January incident on a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.\n\nVideo of the episode showed oxygen masks hanging in front of a gaping airplane space from a panel that blew out shortly after takeoff, leaving passengers exposed to open air at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.\n\nThe hearing in Washington aims \"to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident... and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" said the National Transportation Safety board, which is overseeing the probe.\n\nThe plane soon went back to Portland where it safely landed, although there were eight minor injuries.\n\nThe NTSB immediately launched a probe and after a month said four bolts securing the panel were missing, according to preliminary findings released February 6.\n\nThe agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington state prior to delivery of the aircraft last October.\n\nThe witness list does not include Alaska Airlines.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after providing a detailed summary of the incident in June to journalists touring the company's Renton plant.\n\nBoeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after the arrived in Renton, but the issue \"did not create a safety hazard,\" Lund told reporters.\n\nBut when the fuselage panel, known as the door plug, was removed to replace the rivets, Boeing staff failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Lund said.\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Lund told reporters. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nShe also said Boeing was focused on closing a \"gap\" over the lack of documentation and that determining who did the work \"is the responsibility of the NTSB and that investigation is still going on.\"\n\nAfter Lund's comments were published in June, the NTSB announced it was sanctioning the company for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nLund \"released non-public investigative information and made unsubstantiated speculations about possible causes of the Jan. 5 door-plug blowout, which is directly at issue in the ongoing investigation,\" the NTSB said in a June 27 letter to Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun.\n\nSome of the information \"was either inaccurate or unknown to the NTSB,\" the letter added. \"This disregard of the federal regulations and rules governing NTSB investigations cannot be tolerated.\"\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nNTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"},

The incident, caused by a missing door plug, has highlighted significant issues within Boeing's safety culture, leading to calls for improvements from both the NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board and Boeing have been unable to determine who removed a door plug in a new 737 MAX 9 Alaska Airlines aircraft that experienced an in-flight emergency in January, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said on Tuesday. She emphasized Boeing's need for significant improvements in its safety practices.\n\n\"The safety culture needs a lot of work (at Boeing),\" she stated. \"There's not a lot of trust within the workforce,\" she added. The Federal Aviation Administration has also asserted that Boeing must improve its safety culture and address quality issues before ramping up 737 MAX production.\n\nBoeing did not immediately comment. The NTSB reported the 737 MAX 9 was missing four key bolts. Boeing acknowledged that required documents for the door plug removal were never created.

Boeing has vowed to make key quality improvements.\n\nBoeing's senior vice president for quality, Elizabeth Lund, and Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing, are among those who will testify during the hearings scheduled to last 20 hours over two days, the NTSB said.\n\nLund told the NTSB in a July 6 interview that the planemaker is building far fewer MAXs than it is allowed to produce. In June, it built in the \"low 20s and we are working our way back up. But at one point I think we were as low as eight.\"\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nTerry George, senior vice president and general manager for Boeing Program at Spirit AeroSystems, and Scott Grabon, a senior director for 737 quality at Spirit, which makes the fuselage for the MAX, will also appear, it added.\n\nLast month Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7 billion in stock.\n\nThe hearing will review issues including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\n'TOO HANDS OFF'\n\nBoeing has said no paperwork exists to document the removal of four key missing bolts. Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nIn June, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said the agency was \"too hands off\" in its oversight of Boeing before January. FAA employees told the NTSB that Boeing employees did not always followed required processes.\n\nJonathan Arnold, Aviation Safety Inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing\u00b4s factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least $243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson, Allison Lampert and Abhijith Ganapavaram; editing by Miral Fahmy and Nick Zieminski)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganapavaram,_Eluru_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ganapavaram, Eluru district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_(kitchen)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Galley (kitchen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 75, "textEnd": 80}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1017, "textEnd": 1023}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

We're potentially about to find out a lot more.\n\nThe incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious injuries. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed. The accident did do serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nOne of those investigations is being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal regulator that investigates all manner of accidents, from railroad derailments to some car crashes to virtually all plane crashes.\n\nThe NTSB is scheduled to hold 20 hours of public hearings about the Alaska Airlines incident spread over two days, starting Tuesday morning. It will begin by making public a docket of more than 60 documents running more than 3,800 pages that have been collected in the seven months since the accident. Then will come testimony from NTSB staff investigators and questions from the members of the safety board.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nEven after the hearing, it could be the better part of a year before a final report on the incident is released by the NTSB. But the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67. But when Boeing's board waived the retirement age for top executives for Calhoun in 2021 so he didn't have to retire after two years on the job, he said he intended to stay \"as long as they want me.\" He could have stayed in the job through 2027 under the waiver granted in 2021.\n\nHe has faced harsh criticism for many of Boeing's problems, with more than a dozen whistleblowers at the company complaining to congressional investigators that they faced pressure and retaliation for flagging safety problems in the company's assembly process.\n\nCalhoun has only testified on Capitol Hill once despite all the attention Boeing has received. In a stunning understatement he conceded the company's safety culture was \"far from perfect,\" but vowed that safety is a priority and that the company is making progress. But that didn't stop a bipartisan grilling at a Senate hearing in June.\n\n\"Why haven't you resigned?,\" he was asked by Senator Josh Hawley during that hearing.\n\n\"Senator, I'm sticking this through,\" he replied. But his plans to leave the company by the end of the year had already been announced by the time of the hearing.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The hearing will cover manufacturing, inspections, and safety management among other issues.\n\nThe U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) commenced a critical hearing on Tuesday, targeting key witnesses from Boeing, Spirit AeroSystems, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). These witnesses will provide testimony regarding a mid-air cabin panel blowout of an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9 door plug that occurred in January. The NTSB unveiled 3,800 pages of factual reports and interviews linked to the ongoing investigation.\n\nThis incident significantly tarnished Boeing's reputation, resulting in a two-week grounding of the MAX 9, a production halt mandated by the FAA, a criminal investigation, and the resignation of several top executives. In an effort to rebuild trust, Boeing has pledged to implement essential quality improvements. Among the scheduled witnesses are Elizabeth Lund, Boeing's senior vice president for quality, and Doug Ackerman, the company's vice president of supplier quality. The hearings, set to span 20 hours over two days, are expected to shed light on pertinent issues.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of Spirit AeroSystems are Terry George, senior vice president and general manager for Boeing Program, and Scott Grabon, a senior director for 737 quality. Earlier this year, Boeing agreed to reacquire Spirit AeroSystems for $4.7 billion in stock, a company it originally spun off in 2005. The hearings will scrutinize areas such as 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality systems, FAA oversight, and specifics around the door plug issue.

The investigative agency, which has sought details around who performed the work, has at times sharply criticized Boeing's response to the probe.\n\nEarly questioning of witnesses from Boeing and fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems probed construction and assembly, employee training and policies around change orders.\n\nWhen the fuselage was shipped by train to Boeing's Renton, Washington, facility on August 31, 2023, from Spirit, evidence showed that the bolts were in place, NTSB investigator in charge John Lovell said at the outset of the hearing.\n\nBoeing staff performed work on the part beginning early in the morning of September 18 until late in the evening of September 19 before the jet was delivered to Alaska Airlines, Lovell said.\n\nHearing witnesses include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing,\" said NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. \"What I want to know, what we want to know, is what happened.\"\n\nBoeing sanctioned\n\nLund has previously said that Boeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after they arrived in Renton.

The company took 30,000 recommendations of employee feedback on \"how we can improve quality or product safety.\"\n\nBut prior to the January 5 incident Boeing's \"training was in really bad shape,\" said Lloyd Catlin, of the International Association of Machinists. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it is enough.\"", "source": {"uri": "qnewshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "QNewsHub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aman_desai@qnewshub.com", "name": "Aman Desai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rivet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altitude", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Altitude"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Renton_Factory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Renton Factory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Machinists_and_Aerospace_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whistleblower"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Training_and_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Training and Safety", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://i2.wp.com/scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/2024/a-two-day-hearing-is-s-1.jpg?ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-02-06", "textStart": 699, "textEnd": 709}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-18", "textStart": 1336, "textEnd": 1348}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-19", "textStart": 1378, "textEnd": 1390}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 3836, "textEnd": 3845}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nMembers of the National Transportation Safety Board will hold two days of hearings beginning Tuesday as federal safety investigators seek more information into the circumstances that led to the dramatic midair blowout aboard a Boeing 737 Max jet earlier this year -- an accident that has shaken the public's confidence in commercial air travel and led to renewed scrutiny of the storied company's operations.\n\nAmong those expected to appear are Boeing leaders including Elizabeth Lund, the senior executive overseeing the quality in the company's commercial airplane division, and Terry George, a top executive with Spirit AeroSystems, the Boeing supplier responsible for manufacturing the fuselage involved in the accident. For the first time, the NTSB also will make public thousands of pages of documents that may offer more insight into the failures that led to the Jan. 5 calamity in which a door panel blew off a jetliner operated by Alaska Airlines shortly after it took off from Portland International Airport.\n\nThough no one was seriously injured, the fallout from the incident has been widespread, leading to multiple probes into a company that promised a heightened focus on safety years ago following two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nAs part of its probe, investigators hope to piece together the circumstances that led to the breakdown in the manufacturing process. Boeing said it has already taken steps to prevent a reoccurrence, including ensuring that all work on aircraft moving through final assembly is properly documented.\n\nFederal investigators and Boeing at times have been at odds during the door-panel probe.\n\nAt a March hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy accused Boeing of withholding information critical to the agency's investigation, including the names of individuals who may have worked on the door panel as the plane was being assembled at Boeing's facility in Renton, Wash.\n\nIn June, Boeing was scolded by the NTSB for revealing details of the door panel blowout investigation with media outlets without permission. Companies and organizations that are part of NTSB probes sign agreements not to publicly reveal information about the investigations.\n\nIn a preliminary report released by the NTSB in February, investigators determined that four bolts designed to hold a panel in place were not reinstalled after the part was removed so fixes could be made to the plane's fuselage. Investigators said they have been unable to locate the paperwork that shows who removed the bolts and why they weren't reinstalled. Boeing officials have said that no such paperwork exists.\n\nThe aftermath of the midair blowout has seen Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun's decision to step down, as well as the departure of other senior leaders. Last week, the company named longtime aerospace executive Kelly Ortberg as its next chief executive. Ortberg, 64, will officially take over on Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has imposed limits on the number of 737 Max jets Boeing can build until it is confident the company is following its own procedures for ensuring jets are safe. The FAA's action has not only hurt the company's reputation but has also affected its finances -- the company last week reported a second-quarter net loss of $1.4 billion, more than triple that of a year earlier. Its revenue came in at $16.8 billion, down 14 percent from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe FAA also has come under scrutiny. Last week, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), chair of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, sent a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker, noting that the agency had done nearly 300 audits of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems in the two years prior but none resulted in any enforcement actions. However, a special audit commissioned by the agency turned up myriad noncompliance issues at Boeing. The FAA's oversight of Boeing will be examined on the second day of the NTSB hearing.\n\nA final report on the blowout, including probable causes and recommendations, could take a year to 18 months to complete.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lori_aratani@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Lori Aratani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ian_duncan@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Ian Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Investigators", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BWHVEO3S2QDTK4QWNRLC6XBWMA_size-normalized.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 960, "textEnd": 966}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Boeing has vowed to make key quality improvements.\n\nBoeing's senior vice president for quality, Elizabeth Lund, and Doug Ackerman, vice president of supplier quality for Boeing, are testifying Tuesday during the hearings scheduled to last 20 hours over two days. Ackerman said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial airplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nLund said Tuesday Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly MAX production - far fewer MAXs than the 38 per month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point I think we were as low as eight,\" Lund told the NTSB.\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said. \"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nTerry George, senior vice president and general manager for Boeing Program at Spirit AeroSystems, and Scott Grabon, a senior director for 737 quality at Spirit, which makes the fuselage for the MAX, also testified Tuesday.\n\nLast month Boeing agreed to buy back Spirit AeroSystems, whose core plants it spun off in 2005, for $4.7 billion in stock.\n\nThe hearing is reviewing issues including 737 manufacturing and inspections, safety management and quality management systems, FAA oversight, and issues surrounding the opening and closing of the door plug.\n\n'TOO HANDS OFF'\n\nBoeing has said no paperwork exists to document the removal of four key missing bolts. Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nIn June, FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said the agency was \"too hands off\" in its oversight of Boeing before January. FAA employees told the NTSB that Boeing employees did not always followed required processes.\n\nJonathan Arnold, Aviation Safety Inspector at the FAA, said a systemic issue he witnessed at Boeing's factory was employees not following the instructions.\n\n\"That seems to be systemic where they deviate from their instructions. And typically, tool control is what I see most,\" Arnold said.\n\nLund said before the Jan. 5 accident, every 737 fuselage delivered to Boeing had defects - but the key is making sure they are manageable. \"What we don't want is the really big defects that are impactful to the production system,\" Lund said. \"We were starting to see more and more of those kinds of issues. I will tell you right around the time of the accident.\"\n\nThe interviews also addressed questions of factory culture, which has been under fire in congressional hearings. Whistleblowers have alleged that Boeing retaliated against people coming forward with safety concerns on the factory floor.\n\nBoeing executive Carole Murray described various problems with fuselages coming from Spirit AeroSystems in the run-up to the accident. \"We had defects. Sealant was one of our biggest defects that we had write-ups on,\" she said. \"We had multiple escapements around the window frame, skin defects.\"\n\nMichelle Delgado, a structures mechanic who worked as a contractor at Boeing and did the rework on the Alaska MAX 9 aircraft, told NTSB the workload is heavy and requires working long hours.\n\n\"When we're very overwhelmed with work, it is pressing because with everything we've cut down on some personnel, so now it's like in order for me to not have to deal with a worse situation tomorrow, I'd rather work a 12 to 13-hour shift to get it all done, for my sake, so I don't have to deal with people the next day.\"\n\nAlso in June, the NTSB said Boeing violated investigation rules when Lund provided non-public information to media and speculated about possible causes.\n\nLast month, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and pay a fine of at least $243.6 million to resolve a Justice Department investigation into two 737 MAX fatal crashes.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson, Allison Lampert, Tim Hepher, Rajesh Kumar Singh and Abhijith Ganapavaram;

Spirit then shipped the fuselage last summer to Boeing's Renton, Washington, facility.\n\nRELATED STORY | Boeing names new president and CEO following big second quarter loss\n\nThe plug was taken off when to fix some damaged rivets, but the bolts of the plug were never reinstalled when the plug was put back into place. It's still not clear who took the door plug off at the Renton facility.\n\nThe NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details and transcripts of interviews with workers, including contractors who said they felt like the \"cockroaches of the factory,\" working six to seven days a week, with major pressure from Boeing.\n\nOther workers interviewed by the NTSB said that the company's safety culture was \"garbage.\"\n\nIn an interview during a lunch break, Homendy told reporters: \"These are known issues. Again, why does it take a serious tragedy which could have been so much more serious for change to occur?\"\n\n\"Going into all of this with the 737 Max, and it would really apply to all businesses, frankly, not just airline manufacturers, is that clearly they took their eye off the ball and and they're paying a huge price,\" said Chris Dane, the president of Hickory Global Partners who has five decades of experience in the aerospace industry.\n\nDespite the high price Boeing is paying, he believes the company is on the right path to fix its quality and culture issues.

The investigative agency, which has sought details around who performed the work, has at times sharply criticized Boeing's response to the probe.\n\nEarly questioning of witnesses from Boeing and fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems probed construction and assembly, employee training and policies around change orders.\n\nWhen the fuselage was shipped by train to Boeing's Renton, Washington, facility on August 31, 2023, from Spirit, evidence showed that the bolts were in place, NTSB investigator in charge John Lovell said at the outset of the hearing.\n\nBoeing staff performed work on the part beginning early in the morning of September 18 until late in the evening of September 19 before the jet was delivered to Alaska Airlines, Lovell said.\n\nHearing witnesses include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing,\" said NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. \"What I want to know, what we want to know, is what happened.\"\n\n- Boeing sanctioned -\n\nLund has previously said that Boeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after they arrived in Renton. But when the door plug was removed to replace the rivets, workers failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Lund said.\n\nMore from this section Flurry of diplomacy to ease Mideast tensions as Israel awaits Iran attack Farmers innovate to save Iraq's rice production McLaughlin-Levrone, Bol stroll through Olympics 400m hurdles heats\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Lund told journalists during a tour in June. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nLovell confirmed that the rivets were replaced under a non-conformance order, with the work conducted by Spirit personnel at Boeing's Renton factory.\n\n\"Post-accident evidence showed that the retaining bolts were not installed,\" Lovell said.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after the June comments, with the agency sanctioning Boeing for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nHomendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.\n\nLund acknowledged the need for better communications and the simplification of some procedures at Boeing, but stressed that the company was committed to improving.\n\nLund recounted a quality \"stand down\" in which some 70,000 workers took an eight-hour work day to review safety policies. The company took 30,000 recommendations of employee feedback on \"how we can improve quality or product safety.\"\n\nBut prior to the January 5 incident Boeing's \"training was in really bad shape,\" said Lloyd Catlin, of the International Association of Machinists. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it is enough.\"\n\njmb/nro", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news",

We're potentially about to find out a lot more.\n\nThe incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious injuries. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed. The accident did do serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nOne of those investigations is being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal regulator that investigates all manner of accidents, from railroad derailments to some car crashes to virtually all plane crashes.\n\nThe NTSB is scheduled to hold 20 hours of public hearings about the Alaska Airlines incident spread over two days, starting Tuesday morning. It will begin by making public a docket of more than 60 documents running more than 3,800 pages that have been collected in the seven months since the accident. Then will come testimony from NTSB staff investigators and questions from the members of the safety board.\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening.

We're potentially about to find out a lot more.\n\nThe incident left a gaping hole in the side of the plane, sending oxygen masks falling from the ceiling, tearing off clothing and ripping phones out of passengers' hands and hurling them into the darkness.\n\nFortunately, the crew was able to land the crippled jet without any serious injuries. It was a combination of the skill of the flight crew and good luck that no one was killed. The accident did do serious damage to the public's confidence in plane manufacturer Boeing, prompting a series of federal investigations into its practices and the safety and quality of its aircraft.\n\nOne of those investigations is being conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal regulator that investigates all manner of accidents, from railroad derailments to some car crashes to virtually all plane crashes.\n\nThe NTSB is scheduled to hold 20 hours of public hearings about the Alaska Airlines incident spread over two days, starting Tuesday morning. It will begin by making public a docket of more than 60 documents running more than 3,800 pages that have been collected in the seven months since the accident. Then will come testimony from NTSB staff investigators and questions from the members of the safety board.\n\nMissing bolts -- and missing paperwork\n\nThe NTSB has already released preliminary findings from the incident, disclosing that the plane used on the flight left the Boeing factory in Renton, Washington, 10 weeks earlier and without the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place.\n\nSince that report, Boeing has said the reasons for that oversight came down to something as simple as a lack of paperwork.\n\nWhen the fuselage of the plane arrived at the Boeing factory from supplier Spirit AeroSystems, the door plug was in place, as were the four bolts meant to hold it securely attached to the side of the jet. But there were problems with five rivets near where the door plug was installed, and Boeing workers removed the door plug in order to fix those rivets.\n\nAccording to Boeing, the workers who fixed the rivets didn't generate the paperwork indicating they had removed the door plug and the four bolts in order to do that work.\n\nWhen a different group of employees put the plug back in place, Boeing says the employees didn't think the plane would actually fly in that condition. Instead, they were just blocking the hole with the plug to protect the inside of the fuselage from weather as the plane moved outside to a different area of the factory compound. That group of employees often makes those kind of temporary fixes.\n\nThose employees likely assumed paperwork existed showing that the plug and bolts had been removed, and that paperwork would prompt someone else along the line to install the bolts. But without the paperwork, no one on the assembly line knew that the door plug had ever been removed, or that its bolts were missing and needed to be replaced.\n\nTragedy narrowly averted\n\nThe fact that the door plug didn't come out when the plane was at 35,000 feet rather than at a lower altitude with passengers still buckled into their seats is the first part of the good luck.\n\nThe plane made 153 flights with passengers on it from the time it was delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and the January 5 flight, including 22 flights that took it over the Pacific Ocean for hours flying to and from Hawaii. It would have had much more difficulty making it safely to the ground if the door plug had failed hours, rather than minutes, from the nearest runway.\n\nAnd the fact that the two seats immediately adjacent to the door plug were two of the only seven empty seats on the plane carrying 177 people was very important in preventing fatalities. The force of the air inside the cabin rushing through the hole was enough to twist and bend the metal seats themselves towards the opening. Would-be passengers sitting in those unoccupied seats might not have been able to stay in the the plane, especially if they were not buckled in.\n\nBut perhaps most fortunate of all, when the door plug came out, it fell away from the plane without hitting the tail section, perhaps damaging the the rudder or the vertical stabilizers on the tail, which are crucial to the plane flying straight, level and under control. If that had happened, it would have been very difficult for the plane to land safely, if at all.\n\nBoeing's mounting problems\n\nEven after the hearing, it could be the better part of a year before a final report on the incident is released by the NTSB. But the probe is only one of the problems Boeing faces because of the incident.\n\nThere could be criminal charges related to the failures that led to the incident, as the FBI has notified passengers and crew members that they might be considered crime victims.\n\nEven before the flight, Boeing faced the possibility of criminal charges because of problems with the 737 Max that were kept hidden from the Federal Aviation Administration during the original certification process. Those problems led to a design flaw on the plane that is blamed for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed 346 people.\n\nIn January 2021, Boeing and the Justice Department agreed to a settlement that deferred criminal prosecution of Boeing for three years for its employees defrauding the FAA during the certification process. But that three-year probationary period had been due to end just days after the January 5 flight. Instead, the DOJ reopened the investigation following the Alaska Airlines incident, and last month Boeing agreed to plead guilty to criminal charges and be put under the supervision of a court-appointed monitor.\n\nThe FAA has also increased scrutiny of Boeing's manufacturing process and is limiting how many planes it can build, which has added to financial losses at the company that have now reached $33 billion since the second fatal crash in 2019.\n\nBoeing's sales have plunged 70% in the first six months of the this year. In June it sold just three passenger jets, and one of those was to Alaska Airlines to replace the plane used in the January 5 flight, which Boeing has repurchased from the airline.\n\nLast days of current leadership\n\nBoeing will get a new boss the day after the hearing ends, as Dave Calhoun, who has served as CEO since January 2020, steps down and Kelly Ortberg, the former CEO of aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins, assumes the top job.\n\nCalhoun's departure is being termed a retirement, and he is 67.

The investigative agency, which has sought details around who performed the work, has at times sharply criticized Boeing's response to the probe.\n\nEarly questioning of witnesses from Boeing and fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems probed construction and assembly, employee training and policies around change orders.\n\nWhen the fuselage was shipped by train to Boeing's Renton, Washington, facility on August 31, 2023, from Spirit, evidence showed that the bolts were in place, NTSB investigator in charge John Lovell said at the outset of the hearing.\n\nBoeing staff performed work on the part beginning early in the morning of September 18 until late in the evening of September 19 before the jet was delivered to Alaska Airlines, Lovell said.\n\nHearing witnesses include Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing,\" said NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy. \"What I want to know, what we want to know, is what happened.\"\n\n- Boeing sanctioned -\n\nLund has previously said that Boeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after they arrived in Renton. But when the door plug was removed to replace the rivets, workers failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Lund said.\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Lund told journalists during a tour in June. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nLovell confirmed that the rivets were replaced under a non-conformance order, with the work conducted by Spirit personnel at Boeing's Renton factory.\n\n\"Post-accident evidence showed that the retaining bolts were not installed,\" Lovell said.\n\nLund came under fire from the NTSB after the June comments, with the agency sanctioning Boeing for sharing details about an ongoing probe that were not supposed to be discussed publicly.\n\nAs a result, the NTSB said it is blocking Boeing from reviewing information gathered in its investigation and will not permit the company to ask questions of other witnesses at the hearing.\n\nHomendy in March had also sharply criticized Boeing's handling of the probe, telling a congressional hearing the company was dragging its feet in providing key documentation and witnesses involved in working on the plane.\n\nTuesday's hearing comes as Boeing faces heavy scrutiny from regulators following the January incident and in the wake of congressional testimony from whistleblowers who say the company punishes workers who raise safety issues while moving to cover up problems.\n\nLund acknowledged the need for better communications and the simplification of some procedures at Boeing, but stressed that the company was committed to improving.\n\nLund recounted a quality \"stand down\" in which some 70,000 workers took an eight-hour work day to review safety policies. The company took 30,000 recommendations of employee feedback on \"how we can improve quality or product safety.\"\n\nBut prior to the January 5 incident Boeing's \"training was in really bad shape,\" said Lloyd Catlin, of the International Association of Machinists. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it is enough.\"\n\njmb/nro\n\nMore from this section\n\nAttorney Jenna Sutter Joins

Boeing jet", "body": "NEW YORK - US investigators will open a two-day hearing on Aug 6 into a near-catastrophic January incident on a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines that required an emergency landing.\n\nVideo of the episode showed oxygen masks hanging in front of a gaping airplane space from a panel that blew out shortly after takeoff, leaving passengers exposed to open air at an altitude of about 16,000 feet (4,880m).\n\nThe hearing in Washington aims \"to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident... and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" said the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which is overseeing the probe.\n\nThe plane soon went back to Portland where it safely landed, although there were eight minor injuries.\n\nThe NTSB immediately launched a probe and after a month said four bolts securing the panel were missing, according to preliminary findings released on Feb 6.\n\nThe agency has collected written documents and photos showing that Boeing employees removed four bolts from these locations during an inspection at the Renton plant in Washington state prior to delivery of the aircraft in October 2023.\n\nOver the course of two day-long sessions on Aug 6 and 7 in Washington, the NTSB will hear from about 15 witnesses.\n\nSpeakers include Ms Elizabeth Lund, senior vice-president for quality at Boeing, among other officials at the company, as well as officials from key supplier Spirit AeroSystems, regulator Federal Aviation Administration and the machinists union.\n\nThe witness list does not include Alaska Airlines.\n\nMs Lund came under fire from the NTSB after providing a detailed summary of the incident in June to journalists touring the company's Renton plant.\n\nBoeing staff identified five \"non-conforming\" rivets in the fuselage after the arrived in Renton, but the issue \"did not create a safety hazard\", Ms Lund told reporters.\n\nBut when the fuselage panel, known as the door plug, was removed to replace the rivets, Boeing staff failed to file the documentation to make the change on the door plug, Ms Lund said.\n\n\"We believe that plug was opened without the correct paperwork,\" Ms Lund told reporters. \"There was a non-compliance to our processes at that point.\"\n\nShe also said Boeing was focused on closing a \"gap\" over the lack of documentation and that determining who did the work \"is the responsibility of the NTSB and that investigation is still going on\".", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType":

Boeing takes ownership of the fuselage as it exits the Spirit factory in Wichita, Kansas, he added. \"We want to have acceptance verification at the location where it is manufactured.\n\nThe plane manufacturer and supplier were given a midday reprimand by Jennifer Homendy, chair of the NTSB, who sounded what she called a word of caution in a raised voice.\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing.

The NTSB also released more than 3,000 pages of documents with details about the incident.\n\nPeople are also reading...

On the intercom, he heard flight attendants talking about a hole in the plane. He decided to land the plane as quickly as possible.\n\nThe pilots landed safely back in Portland. The door plug was found in a high school science teacher's backyard in Cedar Hills, Oregon.\n\nThe accident on flight 1282 occurred minutes after takeoff from Portland, Oregon, as the plane flew at 16,000 feet (4,800 meters). Oxygen masks dropped during the rapid decompression, a few cell phones and other objects were swept through the hole in the plane, passengers were terrified by wind and roaring noise, but miraculously there were no major injuries.\n\n\"This was quite traumatic to the crew and passengers,\" NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said as Tuesday's hearing began, speaking to anyone who may have been on the flight or knew someone aboard. \"We are so sorry for all that you experienced during this very traumatic event.\"\n\nHomendy said seven passengers and one flight attendant received minor physical injuries.\n\nThe NTSB said in a preliminary report that four bolts that help secure the panel, which is call a door plug, were not replaced after a repair job in a Boeing factory, but the company has said the work was not documented. During the hearing, safety board members are expected to question Boeing officials about the lack of paperwork that might have explained how such a potentially tragic mistake occurred.\n\nThe safety board will not determine a probable cause after the hearing. That could take another year or longer. It is calling the unusually long hearing a \"fact-finding\" step.\n\nBoeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems installed the door plug, a panel on many 737s that fills a cutout left for an extra exit required on some planes. The plug on the Alaska Airlines jet was removed and the bolts taken off in a Boeing factory to repair rivets.\n\nAmong the first witnesses called Tuesday was Elizabeth Lund, who has served as Boeing's senior vice president of quality -- a new position -- since February.\n\nWitnesses for Spirit and Boeing testified about safety systems and inspection processes. Lund said production of Max jets dropped below 10 per month after the Alaska Airlines blowout and has increased, but remains under 30 per month.\n\nLund and others also discussed the impact of COVID-19 on production and worker experience. Spirit Senior Vice President Terry George said that just five years ago, 95% of its factory employees had worked with sheet metal, but now it is 5%, and they must get more training in drilling holes and installing fasteners in aircraft bodies.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Lund added, most new hires at Boeing factories had aerospace experience, often in the military, but \"coming out of COVID ... we found that considerably more of our employees did not have that aerospace experience.\" She said the company has improved training since the January accident.\n\nBut others remained skeptical. \"We have never been impressed with Boeing's training at all,\" International Association of Machinists' representative Lloyd Catlin said. \"There has been changes, but I don't know that it's enough.\"\n\nLund also said Boeing is working on ways to prevent door plugs from being closed if they are not firmly secured, but she could not say when that redesign might be completed.\n\nLater Tuesday, witnesses are expected to testify about the FAA's oversight of Boeing. FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker has conceded that his agency's oversight of the company \"was too hands-off -- too focused on paperwork audits and not focused enough on inspections.\" He has said that is changing.\n\nThe plane involved had been delivered to Alaska Airlines in late October and had made only about 150 flights. The airline stopped using the plane on flights to Hawaii after a warning light indicating a possible pressurization problem lit up on three different flights.\n\nNo one from the airline was called to testify this week before the NTSB. John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said that indicates the agency has determined \"that Alaska has no dirty hands in this.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He went on to allege that his team was \"replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear,\" and that planes would arrive \"jacked up every day.\" In the case of the January door plug blowout, it was previously revealed that workers at Boeing's Renton factory had removed the plug for maintenance, and then reattached it without four crucial bolts that were designed to hold it in place.\n\nDuring the August 6 hearing, things also got heated when one Boeing executive began to tout safety improvements the company has made since the blowout. NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy quickly admonished the executive, stating that \"this isn't a PR campaign for Boeing,\" and telling them to instead focus their testimony on the investigation into the incident itself.\n\nThe second day of testimony on August 7 will include a handful of Boeing safety managers as well as inspectors with the FAA, with NTSB leaders expected to question them over the FAA's oversight of Boeing.", "source": {"uri": "supplychainbrain.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "supplychainbrain.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Renton_Factory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Renton Factory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.supplychainbrain.com/ext/resources/2024/08/06/Boeing-NTSB-testimony-CSPAN-OK-TO-USE.png?height=418&t=1722964497&width=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 362, "textEnd": 370, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 1974, "textEnd": 1982}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

There's not a lot of trust, there's a lot of distrust within the workforce.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has also said Boeing must improve its safety culture and practices and directed it to address quality issues before the agency will allow the planemaker to boost 737 MAX production.\n\nBoeing did not immediately comment.\n\nThe NTSB has said the 737 MAX 9 was missing four key bolts. Boeing has said required documents detailing the removal of the door plug during production of a 737 MAX 9 that failed during the in-flight emergency were never created.\n\nBoeing has provided a list of 52 prior cases of a door plug removal since 2019.\n\nBoeing's senior vice president for quality, Elizabeth Lund, said the planemaker has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nHomendy said the NTSB has not been able to interview the door plug team manager, who has been on medical leave. Earlier this year, the NTSB had to press Boeing to get the names of the 25 employees who worked on the door plug.\n\nThe NTSB has conducted some interviews and obtained some written statements. \"I have some concerns because each of those written statements end with the line -- I have no knowledge,\" Homendy said. \"It's the same actual line.

But the transcripts released Tuesday show that Boeing had reminded employees about the need to document removals in July 2023, saying in red underlined type that removing or loosening parts had to be recorded.\n\nAccording to the transcripts released Tuesday, some workers described pressure from their bosses to move aircraft through the production line. A manager responsible for the final manufacturing stages said a problem with the panel led to him receiving \"a lot of phone calls, a lot of emails.\"\n\nThe manager said he wanted to see the manufacturing process emphasize caution over speed.\n\n\"I want to see everybody's mentality is to slow down a little bit and get things done correctly instead of pushing and just need to be done,\" the manager said. \"And that needs to be changed from the executive levels, higher up levels.\"\n\nBut some workers described recurring problems that slowed them down and resulted in work being done out of the normal order, causing pressure to mount.\n\n\"Somewhere, '22 or '23, we were replacing doors like we were replacing our underwear: forward doors, cargo doors, E/E bay doors,\" one team leader told investigators. \"The planes come in jacked up every day. Every day.\"\n\nTuesday marked the first of two days of hearings this week the NTSB is holding to gather more information about an accident that has shaken the public's confidence in commercial air travel and led to renewed scrutiny of the storied company's operations.\n\nAmong those appearing at the hearing are Boeing leaders including Elizabeth Lund, the senior executive overseeing the quality in the company's commercial airplane division, and Terry George, a top executive with Spirit AeroSystems, the Boeing supplier responsible for manufacturing the fuselage involved in the accident.\n\nThough no one was seriously injured, the fallout from the incident has been widespread, leading to multiple probes into a company that promised a heightened focus on safety years ago following two 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019 that killed a total of 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia.\n\nIn a preliminary report released by the NTSB in February, investigators determined that four bolts designed to hold a panel in place were not reinstalled after the part was removed so fixes could be made to the plane's fuselage. Investigators said they have been unable to locate the paperwork that shows who removed the bolts and why they weren't reinstalled. Boeing officials have said that no such paperwork exists.\n\nBoeing said it has already taken steps to prevent a reoccurrence, including ensuring that all work on aircraft moving through final assembly is properly documented.\n\nFederal investigators and Boeing at times have been at odds during the door-panel probe.\n\nAt a March hearing before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy accused Boeing of withholding information critical to the agency's investigation, including the names of individuals who may have worked on the door panel as the plane was being assembled at Boeing's facility in Renton, Wash.\n\nIn June, Boeing was scolded by the NTSB for revealing details of the door panel blowout investigation with media outlets without permission. Companies and organizations that are part of NTSB probes sign agreements not to publicly reveal information about the investigations.\n\nThe aftermath of the midair blowout has seen Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun's decision to step down, as well as the departure of other senior leaders. Last week, the company named longtime aerospace executive Kelly Ortberg as its next chief executive. Ortberg, 64, will officially take over on Thursday.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration has imposed limits on the number of 737 Max jets Boeing can build until it is confident the company is following its own procedures for ensuring jets are safe. The FAA's action has not only hurt the company's reputation but has also affected its finances - the company last week reported a second-quarter net loss of $1.4 billion, more than triple that of a year earlier. Its revenue came in at $16.8 billion, down 14 percent from the same quarter last year.\n\nThe FAA also has come under scrutiny. Last week, Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), chair of the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, sent a letter to FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker, noting that the agency had done nearly 300 audits of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems in the two years prior but none resulted in any enforcement actions. However, a special audit commissioned by the agency turned up myriad noncompliance issues at Boeing. The FAA's oversight of Boeing will be examined on the second day of the NTSB hearing.\n\nA final report on the blowout, including probable causes and recommendations, could take a year to 18 months to complete.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assembly line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airliner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airliner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seattle"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_George", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Commerce,_Science,_and_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Cantwell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maria Cantwell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.adn.com/resizer//dtSNgvpHfxk044X2oX_xsclI0EU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/adn/353JN5VTIRTMZXAYSEGV76WAJE.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

While the main outlines are known about what led to the Jan. 5 accident, the session may shed new light on the inner workings at Boeing before the near-disaster exposed quality lapses at its factories.\n\nThe hearing is among the most extensive yet for the NTSB and follows months of investigation. Interactions between officials and the company boiled over at times, highlighting how much is at stake for both sides. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy at one point accused Boeing of not fully cooperating with the probe, and later bashed the company for providing what it called misleading information to the public.\n\nBoeing, for its part, is only now starting to emerge from crisis mode. The company announced a new chief executive last week, it has agreed to buy back Spirit to gain greater control of its manufacturing, and the company pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge by US prosecutors stemming from two previous 737 Max crashes. Its stock has lost more than a third of its value this year, and the company burned through more than $1 billion in cash each month as it slowed output.\n\nFrom the beginning, the door-plug mishap was a unique case. While nobody was seriously injured, the accident attracted huge public interest. The panel was found in a yard shortly afterward, and investigators quickly identified it had been missing four bolts to keep it in place. In a twist, an anonymous tipster published a lengthy online account, documenting the breakdowns that led to the Alaska Airlines-operated jet leaving the factory without the bolts.\n\nA preliminary report released by the NTSB corroborated parts of that account. It found evidence suggesting the door plug was removed prior to leaving the facility to fix damaged rivets and then reinstalled without being properly attached. Boeing has said it's missing formal documentation on the panel's removal, a serious violation of its manufacturing protocols.\n\nThe jet's fuselage arrived from Spirit with defective rivets on the mid-exit door, Elizabeth Lund, a Boeing senior vice president of quality who is testifying at the hearing, said during a reporter briefing in June. As it wound through the factory, Boeing and Spirit representatives in the Renton, Wash. factory debated what should be done and who was responsible.\n\nThe jet was at the end of the line before the companies agreed on a plan that would require removing the door plug for the repair. But while the rivet work was entered into Boeing's formal record system, there was no mention of the door removal. Workers who put it back thought they were doing so temporarily while the aircraft was parked outside to protect it from the elements.\n\nIn the absence of documentation, the team that prepared the plane for delivery was unaware the bolts were missing, and quality inspectors wouldn't have known to check the workmanship, Lund said at the time.\n\nAfter that briefing, Boeing received a scathing rebuke from the NTSB, which said the company violated the terms of an agreement that prohibited it from sharing non-public information. As a result, the agency imposed restrictions on the company revoking its right to ask questions during the two days of hearings or to access investigative information the NTSB produces.\n\nThe accident has spurred profound changes at Boeing. The planemaker has overhauled its management team and slowed work to a crawl in its factories as it retrained mechanics and managers, while also encouraging workers to flag quality breakdowns. It stepped up inspections, including at Spirit, in an effort to tackle defects and missing parts that lead to so-called \"traveled work\" where tasks are completed out of the normal sequence.\n\nWhile the hearing could turn up the name of the person responsible for the almost-disastrous error, the NTSB has said it's not focused on casting blame on any one individual.

She used to work on Capitol Hill, she reminded attendees, and so was used to markups that lasted for up to 20 hours.\n\n\"We can and will go longer if needed,\" Homendy said. \"We will not leave until all questions are asked.\"\n\nThe hearing set for Tuesday and Wednesday is part of the NTSB's monthslong investigation into what led a panel to explode off a Boeing 737 MAX plane mid-flight in January. The panel blew off shortly after Alaska Airlines flight 1282 took off from Portland. The plane landed safely with some passengers reporting non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nSetting a no-nonsense tone at the start of the hearing, Homendy told attendees the purpose of the next two days was to receive testimony and evidence that would aid in \"determining the cause\" of the Jan. 5 door plug blowout. It would not be adversarial and did not intend to assign legal liability or fault. But, she continued, \"this doesn't mean tough questions won't be asked.\"\n\nJohn Lovell, the NTSB's investigator-in-charge for the Boeing incident, narrowed the focus to the four bolts meant to secure the door plug in place. Those bolts were not reinstalled after Boeing partially opened the door plug for maintenance.\n\n\"By the end of this investigative hearing, there should be a better understanding of how the four retaining bolts escaped\" Boeing's carefully laid-out procedures and processes for building an airplane, Lovell said.\n\nHomendy reminded attendees Boeing would not be able to ask questions throughout the hearing, part of sanctions the NTSB set in June after Boeing executive Elizabeth Lund disclosed details about the door plug incident to reporters during a factory tour. Lund, Boeing's senior vice president of quality, is one of a handful of Boeing executives set to testify on Tuesday.\n\nDespite the reprimands, Homendy thanked Boeing for attending the hearing and participating in the board's investigation.\n\nAfter starting to say Boeing and the NTSB had a \"shared goal\" in determining the facts about what led to the blowout, Homendy paused, switched gears and told attendees that the parties had a \"collective duty\" to do so.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_rosenblatt@seattletimes.com", "name": "Lauren Rosenblatt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Homendy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Homendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Aviation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Communication_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Communication Disorders", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Hearing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Hearing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Hearing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/08062024_NTSB_tzr_083001.jpg?d=1020x655", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 1100, "textEnd": 1106}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

They also could not see into the cabin and were focusing on getting their oxygen masks on. They only knew there was a depressurization event because an automated PA announcement came on to alert passengers to use their masks, the documents show. Bright cabin lights also turned on.\n\nCommunication in the cockpit was extremely limited because of noise. Headsets flew off and the oxygen masks were making a squealing noise after the pilots took them off, according to the documents. The pilots decided to put the masks back on to stop the squealing, but then their eye protection began to fog on the final approach, according to the documents.\n\nThe pilots had to continuously repeat certain messages to air traffic controllers because the audio was so bad, according to the documents.\n\nFlight attendants also could not make contact with the flight deck because of the noise. One flight attendant told NTSB investigators she didn't know if there was a hole in the plane in the flight deck and worried the pilots may have been incapacitated, before ultimately being able to make contact with them, according to the documents.\n\n\"The scariest thing was I didn't have exact communication with my flight deck and at first I didn't know if the decompression was in the front, if we have pilots, and not being able to fully communicate with the back and just know exactly what happened and what was going on,\" the unidentified flight attendant told the NTSB, according to the documents. \"I think out of all, that was probably the scariest part out of all that.\"\n\nThe rear flight attendant was initially certain that passengers died, the crew member told NTSB investigators. The flight was nearly full with the exception of a few seats; the two seats next to the missing door plug happened to be empty. When the rear flight attendant felt it was safe enough to leave his oxygen mask, he saw empty seats near the hole and was sure people were sucked out, he told the NTSB, adding that it's so rare for people not to move into an empty window seat or empty row on a full flight.\n\n\"At the point where I first saw the hole, I saw five empty seats,\" he told investigators. \"In that moment I thought we lost -- I was certain that we had lost people because we were full except for a few open seats and I did not recall that 26 A and B had not been occupied. So I was absolutely certain that we had lost people out of the hole and that we had casualties.\"\n\nThe plane safely made an emergency landing and no one was seriously injured in the incident. Tray tables were ripped off and hit passengers on their way out of the aircraft, and one teen lost his top and was badly bruised, according to the documents.\n\nThe pilots had no idea there was a hole in the plane until after the plane landed and passengers deplaned, according to the documents.\n\n\"I knew that there was something wrong,\" one pilot said, according to the transcript. \"I knew that there was a -- there was air being brought into the airplane where there shouldn't be, but I had no idea if it was a hole, if it was a window, if it was a main cabin door. I had no idea. I had no idea. I never heard anything from the flight attendants.\"\n\nThe NTSB has not been able to interview the 737 door plug manager because the employee is on medical leave, the agency said.\n\nThe documents were publicly released as NTSB began holding an investigative hearing into the door plug incident. The hearing, held on Tuesday and Wednesday, will \"assist in obtaining information necessary to determine the facts, circumstances, and probable cause of the transportation accident or incident under investigation and to make recommendations to improve transportation safety,\" the NTSB said in a statement.\n\nDuring the hearing on Tuesday, Boeing Commercial Airplanes senior executive Elizabeth Lund said the company is working on a design change of the door plug to make it even more secure. Planes currently in service will be retrofitted hopefully within a year, she said.\n\nAfter Lund detailed changes the company has implemented in the months following the incident under increased oversight from the Federal Aviation Administration, NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy issued a \"word of caution.\"\n\n\"This is not a PR campaign for Boeing,\" she said. \"You can talk all about where you are today. There's going to be plenty of time for that. We want to know the safety improvements. But what is very confusing for a lot of people who are watching, who are listening, is what was going on then. This is an investigation on what happened on Jan. 5.\"\n\nAn NTSB preliminary report released in February found that four bolts designed to prevent the door plug from falling off the Boeing 737 Max 9 plane were missing before the plug blew off the flight.\n\nBoeing records reviewed by the NTSB showed that damaged rivets on the edge frame forward of the plug were replaced by Spirit AeroSystems employees at Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington, on Sept. 19, 2023, according to the agency's report.\n\nBoeing had to open the plug by removing the two vertical movement arrestor bolts and two upper guide track bolts for the rivets to be replaced, but photo documentation obtained from Boeing showed evidence that the plug was closed with no bolts in three visible locations, according to the NTSB report.\n\nOne bolt area is obscured by insulation in the photo, though the NTSB said it was able to determine in its laboratory that that bolt was also not put back on.\n\nDuring the hearing Tuesday, Lund said that paperwork authorizing the removal of the door plug, which would have documented the work being done, has not been found.\n\nHomendy also addressed the culture between Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, after one unidentified Spirit employee told NTSB investigators, \"Well, basically we're the cockroaches of the factory.\"\n\n\"What have you done since March to address that issue? Have you gotten feedback from your employees?\" she asked Michael Riney, a customer relations director from Spirit AeroSystems based at the Renton facility.\n\nRiney responded that he would discuss with his managers \"to ensure they are soliciting that feedback\" and would \"personally follow up with them to understand what specifically I can do to help with that.\"", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_mask", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oxygen mask"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_deck", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight deck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uncontrolled decompression"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takeoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_(kitchen)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Galley (kitchen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_traffic_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air traffic controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cockpit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_landing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency landing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Commercial Airplanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rivet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_insulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermal insulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renton,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Renton, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/8765e5b3-67be-4b2d-ae3a-e275c167fe67/Alaska-airlines-1-ap-bb-240806_1722959952164_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-05", "textStart": 404, "textEnd": 410, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-09-", "textStart": 5725, "textEnd": 5733}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Ms Lund said Boeing has now put a bright blue and yellow sign on the door plug when it arrives at the factory that says in big letters: \"Do not open\" and adds a redundancy \"to ensure that the plug is not inadvertently opened.\"\n\nIt also has new required procedures if the door plug needs to be opened during production.\n\nA flight attendant described a moment of terror when the door plug blew out. \"And then, just all of a sudden, there was just a really loud bang and lots of whooshing air, like the door burst open,\" the flight attendant said.\n\n\"Masks came down, I saw the galley curtain get sucked towards the cabin.\"\n\nMs Lund and Doug Ackerman, vice-president of supplier quality for Boeing, are testifying on Aug 6 during the hearings scheduled to last 20 hours over two days.\n\nMr Ackerman said Boeing has 1,200 active suppliers for its commercial aeroplanes and 200 supplier quality auditors.\n\nMs Lund said on Aug 6 that Boeing is still building \"in the 20s\" for monthly Max production - far fewer Max aircraft than the 38 a month it is allowed to produce. \"We are working our way back up. But at one point, I think we were as low as eight,\" Ms Lund told the NTSB.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737_MAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boeing 737 MAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redundancy (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galley_(kitchen)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Galley (kitchen)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flight attendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Aerospace", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Ballooning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://static1.straitstimes.com.sg/s3fs-public/styles/large30x20/public/articles/2024/08/07/US-NTSB-HOLDS-INVESTIGATIVE-HEARING-ON-ALASKA-AIRLINES-FLIGHT-12-162328.jpg?VersionId=aISTgOH0yGG_WrAP0_q9UWa_5j5GDbNy", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 28, "textEnd": 33, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The agency won't be releasing any probable cause findings just yet, but that doesn't mean there won't be things we can learn about what went wrong.\n\nWHAT WE'RE LISTENING FOR: The NTSB's goal will be to go \"deep\" into exactly how four bolts on the plane were left off, \"by whom, and under what process,\" said aviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti, who's previously worked at the NTSB and FAA.\n\nA MATTER OF WHEN: Guzzetti said it'll be key to understand whether the parties and NTSB have been able to nail down if there were signs that the door plug assembly was faulty before it popped off at 16,000 feet. (The aircraft had entered service just a little over two months before the incident.)\n\n-- \"I'll be interested to hear if they did think that door was moving on previous flights because the four bolts weren't in,\" Guzzetti told POLITICO. \"Why did it come loose and blow out on that particular flight?\"\n\nALASKA SCRUTINY: Findings related to Boeing's fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems and Alaska Airlines itself will be telling, too, Guzzetti said. That particular Alaska jet prior to the flight had pressurization warning lights activate in the days leading up to the blowout, and Alaska held that aircraft back from long-haul trips until a thorough inspection was completed.\n\nReminder: Boeing won't be permitted to ask questions of other witnesses. The NTSB in June sanctioned Boeing for publicly releasing private investigative details, which Boeing has since apologized for doing. (Though Guzzetti said participants \"never really do\" even when they can.)\n\nWant to receive this newsletter every weekday? Subscribe to POLITICO Pro.

And some are threatening to file legislation to reverse it. The lawmakers say it's an unnecessary disruption to the controllers' lives and families, and the FAA (and the airline industry) say it's the best way to deal with chronic congestion issues in the busy New York airspace.\n\nSWITCHED ON: As of last week, Philadelphia's TRACON welcomed 24 controllers who will help watch over Newark and surrounding airspace -- some that volunteered. And N.Y. Republican Rep. Nick LaLota told your MT host in a statement he's exploring legislation to undo it, possibly through amendments to the House's fiscal 2025 transportation spending bill. More from me on the story.\n\nNOT ANOTHER STAY: The Justice Department on Friday made a request to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals not to issue a stay for Spirit Airlines and Frontier Airlines, which are asking the government for relief from the Biden administration's airline fee transparency rule. Several major airlines and its industry group are also suing DOT over the rule.\n\nTo recap: The same court last month said \"the [r]ule likely exceeds DOT's authority and will irreparably harm airlines\" and requests that another 5th Circuit legal panel rules on its merits before it goes into effect. More from DOJ's filing.\n\nOUT: A California judge last week threw out a lawsuit from a family traveling aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 -- which experienced the door plug blowout in January -- against Boeing and its fuselage supplier Spirit AeroSystems. U.S. District Judge Wesley Hsu granted Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems their motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, according to Law360, but Alaska remains the defendant in the case. The airline has until Aug. 14 to respond to the family's allegations.\n\n-- The Aero Club of Washington has created its first \"person of the year\" award, and will bestow the honor this year to not one, but four, individuals. Those four are the architects of the 2024 FAA Reauthorization Act: House T&I Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.) and ranking member Rick Larsen (D-Wash.), and Senate Commerce Committee Chair Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.) and ranking member Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\n\nLAME DUCK LOGJAM INCOMING: It's officially August recess. So when lawmakers return in September, they'll have just about three weeks before the Sept. 30 government funding deadline, and will most certainly need a continuing resolution to keep funding afloat past the election season and through the end of the year. Both House and Senate appropriations committees last month advanced each of their fiscal 2025 transportation-HUD spending bills through committee, but that's as far as those got. That's in addition to the mountain of other priorities legislators have to get through, which E&E's Andres Picon breaks down in this rundown on Congress' spending outlook.\n\nNO BOOST FOR MANCHIN: West Virginia may be reaping benefits from the sweeping climate-focused Inflation Reduction Act, but Sen. Joe Manchin is seeing none of that love for himself. E&E's Kelsey Brugger gives an inside look of Manchin's decision-making as lawmakers put together the 2022 climate law worth hundreds of billions of dollars -- and what it cost him in the end as the senator heads for the exit.\n\nSpeaking of IRA: Some top Republicans have already expressed a desire to scrap -- or at least modify -- tax credits created by IRA if they take a full majority in November, reports E&E's Garrett Downs. Should they gain control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, key GOP lawmakers like Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) -- one of the top Republicans on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee -- are already planning to use a budget reconciliation package to get a surplus of energy initiatives across, the top being to green-light new oil and gas leasing to create government revenue.\n\nOur colleagues at POLITICO Influence have a rundown of lobbying groups making a push in Washington since the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge earlier this year, and include nearly two dozen entities.

Their aim is to understand how a 737-9 door plug was left unsecured during a non-routine pre-delivery repair and was not detected before it blew out on the aircraft's 154th flight.\n\nNTSB's agenda shows investigators will look carefully at the history of the specific fuselage involved in the accident, from its origins within Spirit's Wichita factory through delivery to Alaska in October 2023. Among the key questions Boeing will answer is why the company has no documentation detailing the plug's opening and closing as part of the repair -- a necessary step to give workers access to non-conforming rivets that prompted the fix.\n\nBut the probe also is delving deep into Boeing's intricate and sometimes convoluted commercial airplane production process. Day one's agenda items include 737-9 fuselage manufacturing and inspections at both Spirit and Boeing, how tasks are assigned to specific mechanics, and non-conformance documentation and processing. Investigators will also ask about shop floor worker training and retention and examine some Boeing-specific systems that play integral roles in aircraft production.\n\nA day-two topic will cover production rate increases \"and actions taken as rate changes\" by both the manufacturer and the FAA.\n\nAmong the key industry witnesses slated to testify are Elizabeth Lund, SVP, Quality of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA); Doug Ackerman, BCA VP-supplier quality; Terry George, Spirit's SVP and general manager of Boeing programs; Scott Grabon, Spirit's senior director, 737/P8 quality; and Gregg Brown, Spirit's SVP-quality and support.\n\nThe board also will dig into FAA's oversight of Boeing and aircraft manufacturing in general. One panel slated for Aug. 7 will examine both an eight-week audit prompted by the Alaska occurrence and the \"effectiveness of FAA guidance\" for manufacturers. Another second-day panel is dedicated to safety and quality management systems.\n\nBoeing has made numerous changes to its production process since January, prompted by early lessons learned from the Alaska accident. It has stopped accepting non-conforming fuselages from Spirit, for example, cutting down on extra work done in its factories that often led to production-line bottlenecks. It also has stopped prioritizing \"movement of the airplane through the factory over getting it done right,\" as CFO Brian West explained in March.\n\nThe most visible changes have come in key leadership positions, including the departure of CEO Dave Calhoun, whose last day is the second day of the hearing. Industry veteran Kelly Ortberg takes over as Boeing's top executive Aug. 8.\n\nDespite the changes, Boeing remains under close FAA scrutiny. It is unable to add a planned fourth 737 production line or ramp up production rates past 38 per month until the FAA is satisfied the company's safety and quality improvements are bearing fruit.", "source": {"uri": "aviationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aviation Week"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boeing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association_of_Machinists_and_Aerospace_Workers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuselage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fuselage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aviation_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Aviation Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flight International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_AeroSystems", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spirit AeroSystems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace_manufacturer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace manufacturer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Transportation_Safety_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Transportation Safety Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Commercial_Airplanes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boeing Commercial Airplanes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_People's_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swiss People's Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airplane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airplane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wichita, Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Calhoun", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Calhoun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_West_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian West (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Aeronautical", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Aeronautical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Aviation/Simulation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/2024-08/boeing_737_manufacturing_sean_broderick_awst.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793139", "eventUri": "eng-9793139", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "dateEnd": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 317, "textEnd": 325}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2220, "textEnd": 2226}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 3118, "textEnd": 3124}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

But I will if necessary,\" Merchan said from the bench.\n\nImprisonment would be an unprecedented step in the historic trial, which stems from hush-money payments that former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nThe prosecutors have argued that Trump himself directed the payments, in an attempt to silence Daniels, who claimed they had an extramarital affair.\n\nTrump, who faces 34 felony charges in the case, is accused of engaging in a conspiracy that aimed to \"undermine the integrity\" of the 2016 presidential election, by suppressing information that would have been unflattering to his campaign.\n\nAfter Merchan's ruling, jurors saw bank records and heard testimony from two members of the Trump Organization -- one a former employee, the other current -- who spoke to invoices and logs related to the alleged hush-money payments.\n\nTrump, who is the presumptive Republican Party nominee heading into November's presidential election, has pleaded not guilty and accused prosecutors of seeking to derail his re-election bid. He has also denied any sexual relations with Daniels.\n\nHere are five key takeaways from the 12th day of the trial.\n\nFor the first time, jurors on Monday heard about the reimbursements at the root of the charges against Trump.\n\nFormer Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney testified about conversations he had with the company's longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg in January 2017 about reimbursing Cohen.\n\n\"Allen Weisselberg said we had to get some money to Michael, we had to reimburse Michael. He tossed a pad toward me and I started taking notes on what he said,\" McConney testified. \"That's how I found out about it.\"\n\nCohen, who had worked for the Trump Organization for about a decade, had just been taken off the payroll as a salaried employee. However, he had paid $130,000 to lawyer Keith Davidson, who represented the adult film star Daniels, in an effort to buy her silence.\n\nA bank statement displayed in court showed Cohen paying Davidson $130,000 on October 27, 2016, out of an account for a shell company Cohen created for that purpose.\n\nWeisselberg's handwritten notes about reimbursing Cohen were stapled to the bank statement in the company's files, McConney testified.\n\nThe notes spell out a plan to pay Cohen a base reimbursement of $180,000 -- covering the payment to Davidson and an unrelated technology bill. That total was then doubled or \"grossed up\" to cover the state, city and federal taxes that Weisselberg estimated Cohen would incur on the payments.\n\nWeisselberg then added a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000, according to the notes.\n\nThe reimbursement payments were listed as legal fees, something which prosecutors say underscores their claim that Trump falsified business records.\n\nAfter paying the first two reimbursement cheques to Cohen through a trust, the remainder of the cheques -- covering payments from April to December 2017 -- were paid from Trump's personal account, McConney also testified.\n\nWith Trump, the only signatory to that account, in the White House, the change in funding source necessitated \"a whole new process for us\", McConney said.\n\nMcConney's own notes were also shown in court. After calculations that laid out that Cohen would get $35,000 a month for 12 months, McConney wrote: \"wire monthly from DJT\".\n\nAsked what that meant, McConney said, \"That was out of the president's personal bank account.\"\n\nMcConney's testimony also touched on a key part of the case: how and why Cohen's reimbursement for the Daniels payment was entered as a legal expense. He testified that he instructed an accounting department employee to do so.\n\nAll expenses had to be entered in the general ledger with a category code, and McConney instructed the accounting team to enter the code for legal expenses: 51505.\n\n\"We were paying a lawyer,\" McConney said of Cohen on Monday.\n\nUnder cross-examination later in the day, McConney acknowledged that Trump never directed him to log Cohen's payments as legal expenses, nor did Weisselberg say Trump had wanted them listed that way.\n\nTrump lawyer Emil Bove also pointed out that Cohen was a lawyer and that \"payments to lawyers are legal expenses\".\n\nTrump's team has argued there was nothing illegal about the way Cohen was paid.\n\nThe prosecution also called Deborah Tarasoff, the accounts payable supervisor at the Trump Organization, to the stand on Monday afternoon.\n\nTarasoff was the recipient of a 2017 email in which McConney told her to \"post to legal expenses\" the reimbursement payments to Cohen. She prepared the cheques used to pay the former Trump lawyer.\n\nTarasoff testified about the process through which the cheques used to reimburse Cohen were issued.\n\nMost of the cheques were paid out of Trump's personal account and were signed by him at the White House, she said. She added that cheques would then return with Trump's Sharpie signature.\n\n\"I'd pull them apart, mail out the cheque and file the backup,\" she said, meaning putting the invoice into the Trump Organization's filing system.\n\nTwo other cheques shown in court were drawn from Trump's revocable trust, which was used to hold his assets while he was president.\n\nIt bore the signatures of two trustees: Trump's son Donald Trump Jr and Weisselberg, the Trump Organization's longtime finance chief.\n\nThe cheques were logged in internal records as legal expenses arising from a retainer agreement. Prosecutors allege the payments were mislabelled to conceal Cohen's reimbursement and the underlying hush-money payment.\n\nMonday's $1,000 fine against Trump was the 10th such punishment for violating a court-imposed gag order, which bars the ex-president from making comments about the jurors, witnesses and families of court employees that might interfere with the case.\n\nBut as he issued the fine, Judge Merchan noted the nine previous fines of $1,000 each did not seem to be preventing Trump from violating the gag order.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore, going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Merchan told Trump and his defence team.\n\nThe judge also emphasised that jail time was \"truly the last resort\", as it could disrupt the trial and have implications for Trump's 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Merchan added that Trump's \"continued, willful\" violations of the gag order amounted to a \"direct attack on the rule of law\".\n\nThe latest violation stemmed from an April 22 interview Trump gave to a right-wing broadcaster, in which he criticised the jury composition. \"That jury was picked so fast -- 95 percent Democrats. The area's mostly all Democrat,\" Trump said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the courtroom on Monday, Trump continued to strike a defiant tone.\n\n\"It's a ridiculous case, I did nothing wrong -- absolutely nothing wrong,\" said Trump, accusing the judge of stripping him of his \"constitutional rights\" with the gag order. \"He's taken away my constitutional right to speak.\"", "source":

SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ - Associated Press\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday and warned that future gag order violations could send him to jail, while jurors heard detailed testimony for the first time about the financial reimbursements at the center of the case.\n\nThe testimony from Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, provided a mechanical but vital recitation of how the company reimbursed payments meant to suppress embarrassing stories from surfacing during the 2016 presidential campaign and then logged them as legal expenses in a manner that Manhattan prosecutors said broke the law.\n\nMcConney's appearance on the witness stand came as the first criminal trial involving a former American president entered its third week of testimony. His account lacked the human drama offered Friday by longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, but it nonetheless yielded an important building block for prosecutors trying to pull back the curtain on what they say was a corporate records cover-up of transactions designed to protect Trump's presidential bid during a pivotal stretch of the race.\n\nPeople are also reading...

'Cole is a dude:' Since high school, new Bills safety Bishop has been quick study\n\nAt the center of the testimony, and the case itself, is a $130,000 payment from Trump attorney and personal fixer Michael Cohen to porn actor Stormy Daniels to stifle her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nThe 34 felony counts of falsifying business records accuse Trump of labeling the money paid to Cohen in his company's records as legal fees. Prosecutors contend that by paying him income and giving him extra to account for taxes, the Trump executives were able conceal the reimbursement.\n\nMcConney and another witness testified that the reimbursement checks were drawn from Trump's personal account. Yet even as jurors witnessed the checks and other documentary evidence, prosecutors did not elicit testimony Monday showing that Trump himself dictated that the payments would be logged as legal expenses, a designation that prosecutors contend was intentionally deceptive.\n\nMcConney acknowledged during cross-examination that Trump never asked him to log the reimbursements as legal expenses or discussed the matter with him at all. And another witness, Deborah Tarsoff, a Trump Organization accounts payable supervisor, said under questioning that she did not get permission to cut the checks in question from Trump himself.\n\n\"You never had any reason to believe that President Trump was hiding anything or anything like that?\" asked Trump attorney Todd Blanche.\n\n\"Correct,\" Tarasoff replied.\n\nThe testimony followed a stern warning from Judge Juan M. Merchan that additional violations of a gag order barring Trump from inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses, jurors and others closely connected to the case could result in jail time.\n\nThe $1,000 fine imposed Monday marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. When the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nYet even as Merchan warned of jail time in his most pointed and direct admonition, he also made clear his reservations about a step that he described as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail,\" Merchan said. \"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nThe latest violation stems from an April 22 interview with television channel Real America's Voice in which Trump criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed, without evidence, that it was stacked with Democrats.\n\nOnce testimony resumed, McConney recounted conversations with longtime Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg in January 2017 about reimbursing Cohen for a $130,000 payment intended to buy Daniels' silence over her account of a sexual encounter at a 2006 celebrity golf outing in Lake Tahoe, California.\n\nWeisselberg \"said we had to get some money to Michael, we had to reimburse Michael. He tossed a pad toward me, and I started taking notes on what he said,\" McConney testified. \"That's how I found out about it.\"\n\n\"He kind of threw the pad at me and said, 'Take this down,'\" said McConney, who worked for Trump's company for about 36 years, retiring last year after he was granted immunity to testify for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial.\n\nA bank statement displayed in court showed Cohen paying $130,000 to Keith Davidson, Daniels' lawyer, on Oct. 27, 2016, out of an account for an entity Cohen created for the purpose.\n\nWeisselberg's handwritten notes spell out a plan to pay Cohen $420,000, which included a base reimbursement that was then doubled to reflect anticipated taxes as well as a $60,000 bonus and an expense that prosecutors have described as a technology contract.\n\nMcConney's own notes, taken on the notepad he said Weisselberg threw at him, were also shown in court. After calculations that laid out that Cohen would get $35,000 a month for 12 months, McConney wrote: \"wire monthly from DJT.\"\n\nAsked what that meant, McConney said: \"That was out of the president's personal bank account.\"\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records by labeling the money paid to Cohen in his company's records as legal fees. Prosecutors contend that by paying him income and giving him extra to account for taxes, the Trump executives were able conceal the reimbursement.\n\nMcConney testified that he had instructed an accounting department employee to record the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense.\n\nBut McConney acknowledged under cross-examination that Trump never directed him to log Cohen's payments as legal expenses, nor did Weisselberg relay to him that Trump wanted them logged that way.\n\n\"Allen never told me that,\" McConney testified. In fact, McConney said he never spoke to Trump about the reimbursement issue at all. Defense lawyer Emil Bove also suggested to McConney that the \"legal expenses\" label was not duplicitous because Cohen was in fact a lawyer.\n\n\"OK,\" McConney responded, prompting laughter throughout the courtroom. \"Sure. Yes.\"\n\nAfter paying the first two checks to Cohen through a trust, the remainder of the checks, beginning in April 2017, were paid from Trump's personal account, McConney testified.\n\nWith Trump, the only signatory to that account, now in the White House, the change in funding source necessitated \"a whole new process for us,\" McConney added.\n\nTarasoff, the other witness who testified Monday, said that once Trump became president, payments from his personal account had to first be delivered, via FedEX, to his new residence in Washington.\n\n\"We would send them to the White House for him to sign,\" she said.\n\nThe checks would then return with Trump's sharpie signature. \"I'd pull them apart, mail out the check and file the backup,\" she said, meaning putting the invoice into the Trump Organization's filing system.\n\nProsecutors are continuing to build toward their star witness, Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. He is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.\n\nTucker reported from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Sisak | Associated Press, Jennifer Peltz | Associated Press, Eric Tucker | The Associated Press and Jake Offenhartz | joffenhartz@ap.org | The Associated Press\n\nBy MICHAEL R. SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday and warned that future gag order violations could send him to jail, while jurors heard detailed testimony for the first time about the financial reimbursements at the center of the case.\n\nThe testimony from Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, provided a mechanical but vital recitation of how the company reimbursed payments meant to suppress embarrassing stories from surfacing during the 2016 presidential campaign and then logged them as legal expenses in a manner that Manhattan prosecutors said broke the law.\n\nMcConney's appearance on the witness stand came as the first criminal trial involving a former American president entered its third week of testimony. His account lacked the human drama offered Friday by longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, but it nonetheless yielded an important building block for prosecutors trying to pull back the curtain on what they say was a corporate records cover-up of transactions designed to protect Trump's presidential bid during a pivotal stretch of the race.\n\nAt the center of the testimony, and the case itself, is a $130,000 payment from Trump attorney and personal fixer Michael Cohen to porn actor Stormy Daniels to stifle her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nThe 34 felony counts of falsifying business records accuse Trump of labeling the money paid to Cohen in his company's records as legal fees. Prosecutors contend that by paying him income and giving him extra to account for taxes, the Trump executives were able conceal the reimbursement.\n\nMcConney and another witness testified that the reimbursement checks were drawn from Trump's personal account. Yet even as jurors witnessed the checks and other documentary evidence, prosecutors did not elicit testimony Monday showing that Trump himself dictated that the payments would be logged as legal expenses, a designation that prosecutors contend was intentionally deceptive.\n\nMcConney acknowledged during cross-examination that Trump never asked him to log the reimbursements as legal expenses or discussed the matter with him at all. And another witness, Deborah Tarsoff, a Trump Organization accounts payable supervisor, said under questioning that she did not get permission to cut the checks in question from Trump himself.\n\n\"You never had any reason to believe that President Trump was hiding anything or anything like that?\" asked Trump attorney Todd Blanche.\n\n\"Correct,\" Tarasoff replied.\n\nThe testimony followed a stern warning from Judge Juan M. Merchan that additional violations of a gag order barring Trump from inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses, jurors and others closely connected to the case could result in jail time.\n\nThe $1,000 fine imposed Monday marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling.

Sisak | Associated Press, Jennifer Peltz | Associated Press, Eric Tucker | The Associated Press and Jake Offenhartz | joffenhartz@ap.org | The Associated Press\n\nBy MICHAEL R. SISAK, JENNIFER PELTZ, ERIC TUCKER and JAKE OFFENHARTZ (Associated Press)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- The judge presiding over Donald Trump's hush money trial fined him $1,000 on Monday and warned that future gag order violations could send him to jail, while jurors heard detailed testimony for the first time about the financial reimbursements at the center of the case.\n\nThe testimony from Jeffrey McConney, the former Trump Organization controller, provided a mechanical but vital recitation of how the company reimbursed payments meant to suppress embarrassing stories from surfacing during the 2016 presidential campaign and then logged them as legal expenses in a manner that Manhattan prosecutors said broke the law.\n\nMcConney's appearance on the witness stand came as the first criminal trial involving a former American president entered its third week of testimony. His account lacked the human drama offered Friday by longtime Trump aide Hope Hicks, but it nonetheless yielded an important building block for prosecutors trying to pull back the curtain on what they say was a corporate records cover-up of transactions designed to protect Trump's presidential bid during a pivotal stretch of the race.\n\nAt the center of the testimony, and the case itself, is a $130,000 payment from Trump attorney and personal fixer Michael Cohen to porn actor Stormy Daniels to stifle her claims of an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier.\n\nThe 34 felony counts of falsifying business records accuse Trump of labeling the money paid to Cohen in his company's records as legal fees. Prosecutors contend that by paying him income and giving him extra to account for taxes, the Trump executives were able conceal the reimbursement.\n\nMcConney and another witness testified that the reimbursement checks were drawn from Trump's personal account. Yet even as jurors witnessed the checks and other documentary evidence, prosecutors did not elicit testimony Monday showing that Trump himself dictated that the payments would be logged as legal expenses, a designation that prosecutors contend was intentionally deceptive.\n\nMcConney acknowledged during cross-examination that Trump never asked him to log the reimbursements as legal expenses or discussed the matter with him at all. And another witness, Deborah Tarsoff, a Trump Organization accounts payable supervisor, said under questioning that she did not get permission to cut the checks in question from Trump himself.\n\n\"You never had any reason to believe that President Trump was hiding anything or anything like that?\" asked Trump attorney Todd Blanche.\n\n\"Correct,\" Tarasoff replied.\n\nThe testimony followed a stern warning from Judge Juan M. Merchan that additional violations of a gag order barring Trump from inflammatory out-of-court comments about witnesses, jurors and others closely connected to the case could result in jail time.\n\nThe $1,000 fine imposed Monday marks the second time since the trial began last month that Trump has been sanctioned for violating the gag order. He was fined $9,000 last week, $1,000 for each of nine violations.\n\n\"It appears that the $1,000 fines are not serving as a deterrent. Therefore going forward, this court will have to consider a jail sanction,\" Merchan said before jurors were brought into the courtroom. Trump's statements, the judge added, \"threaten to interfere with the fair administration of justice and constitute a direct attack on the rule of law. I cannot allow that to continue.\"\n\nTrump sat forward in his seat, glowering at the judge as he handed down the ruling. When the judge finished speaking, Trump shook his head twice and crossed his arms.\n\nYet even as Merchan warned of jail time in his most pointed and direct admonition, he also made clear his reservations about a step that he described as a \"last resort.\"\n\n\"The last thing I want to do is put you in jail,\" Merchan said. \"You are the former president of the United States and possibly the next president as well. There are many reasons why incarceration is truly a last resort for me. To take that step would be disruptive to these proceedings.\"\n\nThe latest violation stems from an April 22 interview with television channel Real America's Voice in which Trump criticized the speed at which the jury was picked and claimed, without evidence, that it was stacked with Democrats.\n\nOnce testimony resumed, McConney recounted conversations with longtime Trump Organization finance chief Allen Weisselberg in January 2017 about reimbursing Cohen for a $130,000 payment intended to buy Daniels' silence over her account of a sexual encounter at a 2006 celebrity golf outing in Lake Tahoe, California.\n\nWeisselberg \"said we had to get some money to Michael, we had to reimburse Michael. He tossed a pad toward me, and I started taking notes on what he said,\" McConney testified. \"That's how I found out about it.\"\n\n\"He kind of threw the pad at me and said, 'Take this down,'\" said McConney, who worked for Trump's company for about 36 years, retiring last year after he was granted immunity to testify for the prosecution at the Trump Organization's New York criminal tax fraud trial.\n\nA bank statement displayed in court showed Cohen paying $130,000 to Keith Davidson, Daniels' lawyer, on Oct. 27, 2016, out of an account for an entity Cohen created for the purpose.\n\nWeisselberg's handwritten notes spell out a plan to pay Cohen $420,000, which included a base reimbursement that was then doubled to reflect anticipated taxes as well as a $60,000 bonus and an expense that prosecutors have described as a technology contract.\n\nMcConney's own notes, taken on the notepad he said Weisselberg threw at him, were also shown in court. After calculations that laid out that Cohen would get $35,000 a month for 12 months, McConney wrote: \"wire monthly from DJT.\"\n\nAsked what that meant, McConney said: \"That was out of the president's personal bank account.\"\n\nTrump is accused of falsifying business records by labeling the money paid to Cohen in his company's records as legal fees. Prosecutors contend that by paying him income and giving him extra to account for taxes, the Trump executives were able conceal the reimbursement.\n\nMcConney testified that he had instructed an accounting department employee to record the reimbursements to Cohen as a legal expense.\n\nBut McConney acknowledged under cross-examination that Trump never directed him to log Cohen's payments as legal expenses, nor did Weisselberg relay to him that Trump wanted them logged that way.\n\n\"Allen never told me that,\" McConney testified. In fact, McConney said he never spoke to Trump about the reimbursement issue at all. Defense lawyer Emil Bove also suggested to McConney that the \"legal expenses\" label was not duplicitous because Cohen was in fact a lawyer.\n\n\"OK,\" McConney responded, prompting laughter throughout the courtroom. \"Sure. Yes.\"\n\nAfter paying the first two checks to Cohen through a trust, the remainder of the checks, beginning in April 2017, were paid from Trump's personal account, McConney testified.\n\nWith Trump, the only signatory to that account, now in the White House, the change in funding source necessitated \"a whole new process for us,\" McConney added.\n\nTarasoff, the other witness who testified Monday, said that once Trump became president, payments from his personal account had to first be delivered, via FedEX, to his new residence in Washington.\n\n\"We would send them to the White House for him to sign,\" she said.\n\nThe checks would then return with Trump's sharpie signature. \"I'd pull them apart, mail out the check and file the backup,\" she said, meaning putting the invoice into the Trump Organization's filing system.\n\nProsecutors are continuing to build toward their star witness, Cohen, who pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments. He is expected to undergo a bruising cross-examination from defense attorneys seeking to undermine his credibility with jurors.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_tucker@twincities.com", "name": "Eric Tucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jennifer_peltz@twincities.com", "name": "Jennifer Peltz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@twincities.com", "name": "Michael R.

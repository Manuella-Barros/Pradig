At the age of 33 years and 51 days, the leg-spinner got her maiden chance to don the national colours.\n\nShe broke the record of Seema Pujare, who debuted for India at the age of 31 in an ODI against Sri Lanka back in 2008 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. Interestingly, apart from Sobhana and Pujare, no other Indian women's cricketer made debuts under the age of 30.\n\nHaving already taken a 3-0 lead in the 5-match series, India made a couple of changes to their playing XI. Even as Titas Sadhu was roped in as a replacement for Renuka Singh Thakur, Sobhana replaced the talented Shreyanka Patil.\n\nSobhana recently earned her maiden India call-up after she performed exceptionally while playing for Smriti Mandhana's RCB in the Women's Premier League (WPL) 2024. In one of the games against Alyssa Healy's UP Warriorz, she picked up a 5-wicket haul.\n\nAlong with Sobhana, right-arm pacer Habiba Islam Pinky made her debut at the age of 14 years and 340 days. Pinky became the second-youngest Bangladeshi to debut in international cricket. Back in 2019, Rabeya Khan wore the national jersey for the first time against Nepal in the South Asian Games.\n\nShe was 14 years and 268 days back then. Rabeya, 19 now, is currently a part of the Bangladesh squad along with Pinky for the T20I series against India.\n\nPinky was not even born when Sobhana started playing domestic cricket. Pakistan's Ayesha Naseem (15 years and 209 days), Bangladesh's Nahida Akter (15 years and 212 days) and India's Shafali Verma (15 years and 239 days) also made their debuts at a young age.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_India_in_2019\u201320", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in India in 2019\u201320"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylhet_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sylhet International Cricket Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leg_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leg spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renuka_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renuka Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangiri_Dambulla_International_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Challengers Bangalore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Women's cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Mandhana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Mandhana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabeya_Khan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rabeya Khan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UP_Warriorz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UP Warriorz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayesha_Naseem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayesha Naseem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafali_Verma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shafali Verma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-wicket_haul", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Five-wicket haul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahida_Akter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nahida Akter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alyssa_Healy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alyssa Healy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asian_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Asian Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nepal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/IWCC", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/asha-sobhana-065231296-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=FDNHCyYUEcPCmKZLrgcLMgR722QFj8qq", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542884", "eventUri": "eng-9542884", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 195, "textEnd": 200}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

I will go to this concert.\"\n\nSaeed will donate money from the show to families displaced by last week's militant attack on Mirza Olang village in northern Afghanistan, which killed at least 62 people with the number expected to rise. The Taleban and Islamic State both claimed responsibility for the attack, in which victims were buried in mass graves. \"This country has deep-rooted problems to be solved,\" said Saeed, who many Afghans compare to reality television star Kim Kardashian for her long, straight black hair and glamorous dress sense.\n\n\"My voice represents peace for my people and a ray of hope for the girls of this country.\" Saeed has received numerous death threats from religious figures and conservatives who say her western outfits and public appearances flout Afghan culture. In addition to singing, she judges the Afghan version of The Voice talent show. Saeed publicly burned a skin-colored dress in May which she wore at a concert in Paris after critics said she looked like she was naked.\n\nIslamic scholars in Bamiyan Province tried to stop a music festival in June but failed following a public outcry.

I will go to this concert\".\n\nSaeed will donate money from the show to families displaced by last week's militant attack on Mirza Olang village in northern Afghanistan, which killed at least 62 people with the number expected to rise.\n\nThe Taleban and Islamic State both claimed responsibility for the attack, in which victims were buried in mass graves.\n\n\"This country has deep-rooted problems to be solved\", said Saeed, who many Afghans compare to reality television star Kim Kardashian for her long, straight black hair and glamorous dress sense.\n\n\"My voice represents peace for my people and a ray of hope for the girls of this country\".\n\nSaeed has received numerous death threats from religious figures and conservatives who say her western outfits and public appearances flout Afghan culture.\n\nIn addition to singing, she judges the Afghan version of The Voice talent show.\n\nSaeed publicly burned a skin-coloured dress in May which she wore at a concert in Paris after critics said she looked like she was naked.\n\nIslamic scholars in Bamiyan Province tried to stop a music festival in June but failed following a public outcry.\n\nCampaigners have accused Muslim clerics of hypocrisy in seeking to block Saeed's concert after photographs circulated on Facebook of senior officials watching a female singer performing at the Pakistan Embassy in Kabul.\n\nNoel Gallagher is set to headline the Manchester Arena reopening concert, We Are Manchester, on Sept 9. The venue has been closed since the May bombing attacks that killed 22 people and injured more than 100 others.\n\nGallagher's presence is especially poignant since his song \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" came to symbolize unity after the tragedy when a crowd started spontaneously singing it at a memorial. The former Oasis star's brother, Liam, performed at the One Love Manchester benefit concert just after the bombings, but Noel did not make an appearance.\n\nOther artists that will perform at the show include indie bands The Courteneers and Blossoms, 1980s pop star Rick Astley, and poet Tony Walsh. The Courteneers covered \"Don't Look Back In Anger\" in front of a crowd of 50,000 people five days after the bombing, and Walsh performed the poem \"This Is the Place\" at a vigil the day after the attack.\n\nAll profits from the show will go toward creating a permanent memorial to the victims, to be built by the new Manchester Memorial Fund. Tickets cost between $32 and $38 (\u00a325-\u00a330), and go on sale Thursday.\n\nMore acts will continue to be announced for We Are Manchester, for which security has been increased. Attendees will be required to undergo additional ID checks, and fans have been asked not to bring bags larger than 35cm x 40cm x 19cm.\n\nThe arena's foyer, where the bomb detonated, has been undergoing renovation since the attacks. Manchester Arena's manager James Allen said, \"May's events will never be forgotten, but they will not stop us -- or Mancunian music fans -- from coming together to enjoy live music.\n\nManchester Arena has celebrated over 20 years hosting some of the greatest musical talent of all time, and the significant economic and cultural impact that this has on the city means that this legacy must continue. Public safety is always our priority and we are doing all we can to keep people safe at our venue\".\n\nCouncillor Sue Murphy, deputy leader of Manchester City Council, added, \"No one will ever forget the terrible events of May 22, but Manchester has reacted with love, solidarity, and a determination to continue doing the things which make this such a vibrant city. We welcome the reopening of the arena, a major venue which attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors, as a powerful symbol of this defiant and resilient spirit\".", "dateTime":

She refuses to wear a head scarf, except when trying to protect her identity in a city where she is instantly recognizable and quickly draws a crowd. For security reasons, she lives in London with her mother and sisters, usually returning to Afghanistan only to perform.\n\nHer music is a combination of traditional and folk songs, rendered as Afghan pop, overlaid occasionally with a bit of hip-hop. She sings in both Dari and Pashto, the country's two main languages.\n\nShe is no stranger to controversy. Appearing as a judge on the popular television show \"Afghan Star,\" on Tolo TV, wearing a curve-clinging gown, she engaged in the forbidden acts of dancing onstage with a male singer and swaying her hips. The television station never broadcast the performance, but posted it on YouTube, drawing widespread condemnation from conservative quarters here.\n\nThat was in March. In May, Ms. Saeed appeared at a sold-out concert in Paris, wearing a flesh-colored dress that conservative Afghans complained made her look as if she were nude. She responded by burning the dress, also on YouTube, while complaining that Afghans worried more about what women wore than about how they were treated.\n\nWomen's issues feature prominently in many of her songs, and she does not mince words, as in \"Lady on Fire\":\n\nWho says I am the mother of this world?\n\nI am nothing, but a burden on the son's shoulders,\n\nI am a slave because I am a wife,\n\nI am a headache when I am a sister,\n\nThis is who I am.\n\nI am the daughter of the Afghan land.\n\nAfghan officials, perhaps wary of Ms. Saeed's popularity, insisted that they had not ordered the concert canceled, and had only warned that the crowd was bigger than expected, making security impossible to ensure.\n\n\"We told them it would be good if you held the concert somewhere else, and the police will always be at your service,\" said Gen. Afzal Aman, acting commander of the Kabul Garrison, which oversees security for the capital.\n\nMullah Attaullah Faizani, the chief of Kabul's Ulema Council, the highest local religious body, said the council had demanded that the Kabul Garrison cancel the concert at Ghazi Stadium.\n\n\"When the country is under the threat of terrorists, we will never allow non-Muslims to hold a concert in Ghazi Stadium,\" he said. (Ms. Saeed has not renounced her Muslim faith.) \"They came from the West and want to stand against our religion, and we will never let them do that. Fighting is ongoing in Afghanistan and every day we lose our civilians, and this is no time to sing and dance.\"\n\nMullah Faizani said that if the concert were held in the stadium, he knew of young people who were so upset they would attack it with flamethrowers. In the end, the singer held her concert on Saturday at the Intercontinental Hotel, announcing that the proceeds would benefit people from the village of Mirza Olang, which the Taliban overran this month.\n\nMs. Saeed's manager, Hasib Sayed, said his client scared the mullahs. \"They are against Aryana Saeed because she works for women's rights in Afghanistan, and they're not happy about that,\" he said. \"If women know their rights, no one can use them as slaves.\"\n\nMs. Saeed scoffed at the mullahs' criticism. \"There are more important things that they should talk about,\" she said. \"For example, they should stand against bacha bazi.\" Bacha bazi is a widespread Afghan practice in which young boys are forced to cross dress and prostituted by older men.\n\n\"They should stand against Taliban that kill our people every day,\" she continued. \"Why are they afraid of me? I am only a singer.\"\n\nThe alternate venue had a much smaller capacity, but the attendees made up for it with noisy enthusiasm. A young woman named Bahar Sohaili said she had come to make a statement.\n\n\"Many women say that they fight for their rights, but after a time they get tired and stop,\" she said. \"Aryana Saeed never gets tired.

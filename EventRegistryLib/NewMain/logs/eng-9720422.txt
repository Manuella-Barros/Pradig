The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy.\n\nTwitter (now X) owner Elon Musk won a court battle yesterday with former employees who had sued him for $500 million after he took over the social media company in 2022. Musk's Twitter takeover not only saw him re brand the company to X, but it also involved the firing of thousands of employees as part of a cost cutting approach. The suit saw the former employees claim severance pay from the company, and a judge in California dismissed the lawsuit by ruling that the former employees were not entitled to benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.\n\nMusk and Twitter were sued in July last year after he fired more than 85% of the firm's staff after taking over. Back then, the executive had shared that Twitter was unprofitable, and he would have not only to significantly reduce headcount to cut costs but also introduced new features to generate revenue. One such feature came in the form of a subscription model, where users had to pay Twitter (now X) to get a verified account. A verified account would increase a user's post reach, and subsequent tiers introduced since then also allow users to generate subscription revenue through their accounts and use features such as long form posts.\n\nAfter the Twitter layoffs, a former manager and the former head of compensation sued Musk and their ex employer for failing to provide severance pay as part of the lay offs. They argued that while workers got severance pay that was equal to one month's compensation, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Subsequently, the suit had argued that if X had followed its compensation plan, the employees would have been cumulatively entitled to $500 million.\n\nWhile X paid the employees one month of severance pay, the lawsuit had argued that actual payment, according to the Twitter severance plan before Musk took over ranged from anywhere between two months to six months. The minimum severance, according to this plan, was \"two months base salary, prorated performance bonuses, cash value of any RSUs vesting within three months of separation, and a cash contribution for continued healthcare coverage.\" It added that Musk and the defendants knew that not adhering to the severance plan would lead to mass resignations that could not only jeopardize the multi billion dollar acquisition but also X's viability.\n\nAdditionally, while the suit had claimed that \"no point did Twitter, Mr. Musk, the Doe Defendants, or anyone with control or discretion over the Plan inform employees of the anticipated changes to the severance Plan,\" and \"management communication with Plan participants had largely gone silent since Mr. Musk's takeover,\" US San Francisco District Judge Trina Thompson ruled that the employee claims were not covered by the ERISA as X had told employees after the takeover that those who were fired would only get cash payouts.\n\nThe ERISA allows an employer to terminate the plan in several instances. These include situations where a firm is facing bankruptcy liquidation and if the costs of continuing the plan would lead to business failure.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramish_zafar@wccftech.com", "name": "Ramish Zafar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_adviser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial adviser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_rata", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro rata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vesting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liquidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Twitter-will-be-rebranded-claims-Elon-Musk.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720422", "eventUri": "eng-9720422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

The case originated after Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now called X, in October 2022.\n\nElon Musk secured a legal win on Tuesday when a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit claiming he failed to pay at least $500 million in severance to thousands of Twitter employees laid off after his acquisition of the social media platform, now known as X. U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco ruled that the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act did not cover the employees' claims, thus she lacked jurisdiction over the case.\n\nThe lawsuit is one of many accusing Musk of reneging on agreements with former Twitter employees and vendors following his $44 billion purchase of the company in October 2022. Musk, who also leads Tesla and is ranked the world's richest person by Forbes, has faced multiple legal challenges during his tenure at Twitter.\n\nSanford Heisler Sharp, representing the former employees, expressed disappointment and stated they are considering further legal options. Lawyers for Musk and Twitter did not immediately comment. According to the complaint, Twitter had promised severance of two to six months' pay plus additional benefits, but instead offered only one month of pay with no added benefits.

(Twitter was rebranded as X in July 2023) were accused of violating provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by allegedly misleading employees about whether he'd honor a severance plan \"at least as favorable\" as one developed by prior Twitter management, leading some staff to stay at the company longer than they otherwise would have and getting less severance pay than they expected when they were let go.\n\nThe class-action lawsuit, which was brought by Courtney McMillian, who oversaw Twitter's benefits programs, sought at least $500 million in allegedly owed severance pay to some 6,000 laid-off employees.\n\nIn a July 9 order, U.S. District Judge Tina Thompson in San Francisco dismissed the complaint against Mr. Musk, arguing that the employees' claims weren't covered under ERISA rules in part because the company notified staff after Mr. Musk took over the company that any laid-off staffers would get lower payouts under a new plan.\n\n\"Communications were made by Defendants showing that the named Plaintiffs would no longer have access to the earlier plan, which was discontinued or modified greatly,\" the judge wrote.\n\nAnother factor weighing in favor of dismissal was that the plaintiffs failed to show that the severance plan Mr. Musk promised after taking the company over broke any provisions of ERISA, which sets rules for benefit plans.\n\n\"All of Plaintiffs' claims in their operative complaint require the plan to be governed by ERISA. As such, the complaint fails to state sufficient facts to survive a Motion to Dismiss,\" reads the judge's order.\n\nThe judge gave the plaintiffs 21 days to file an amended complaint that states claims to severance pay based on the plans that were in effect after Mr. Musk took over the social media platform.\n\nRequests for comment sent to attorneys representing Mr. Musk and Ms. McMillian were not immediately returned.\n\nMs. McMillian's original complaint claimed that under Twitter's 2019 severance plan, developed by prior management, most workers were promised two months of their base pay plus one week of pay for each full year of service if they were laid off. Senior employees like Ms. McMillian were promised six months of base pay, plus one week for each full year of experience, according to the complaint.\n\nHowever, after Mr. Musk took over, laid-off workers were given at most one month of severance and two months' worth of pay, according to Ms. McMillian's complaint, which alleged that this was a \"fraction\" of the $500 million to which laid-off employees were entitled.\n\nFollowing a round of mass layoffs, Mr. Musk said in a post on Twitter in November 2022 that staff would receive three months' worth of pay, which he said was 50 percent more than required by law.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/05/id5663226-GettyImages-1757203725-LSedit-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720422", "eventUri": "eng-9720422", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 837, "textEnd": 843}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

On Tuesday, Musk defeated one of them, as a federal judge ruled X Corp. doesn't owe the ex-employees any more severance.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by Twitter's former head of people experience and another ex-manager alleged that X Corp. paid fired Twitter employees less severance than they were contractually promised. The complaint stated Twitter offered these 6,000 fired employees, at most, three months of severance pay, which Musk confirmed in a tweet at the time. Twitter's Severance Plan, which was in effect since 2019, had previously promised senior employees upwards of six months of severance pay, according to the complaint.\n\nThe plaintiff estimated Musk owed these former employees upwards of $500 million, citing protections under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\n\nU.S. District Judge Trina Thompson dismissed the class action lawsuit in San Francisco on Tuesday.\n\nIn a court filing, Judge Thompson said the ERISA protections did not apply because Musk's company notified employees shortly after the October 2022 takeover that fired employees would only receive cash payouts. Because of this notice, the mass firings that occurred in November were not under Twitter's previous severance plan, according to the judge.\n\nA lawyer representing the plaintiffs in this case did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.\n\nSince the November 2022 firings, X Corp has operated the social media platform with a barebones staff. Musk told the BBC in 2023 that he brought Twitter's staff down to 1,500 employees, from roughly 8,000 before his takeover, citing major cost-cutting efforts. Despite the efforts, X has continued to struggle, as documents obtained by Bloomberg showed the company lost $456 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMusk is not out of the water yet for these mass firings. In another lawsuit, Agrawal and three other former Twitter Inc. executives are seeking $128 million in severance payments from X Corp. after they were let go in the mass firing. Another lawsuit from former senior employees at Twitter seeks more than $1 million in severance payments, but Musk says he never agreed to these former employees' benefit plans.", "source": {"uri": "techcrunch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechCrunch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Corp.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "X Corp."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parag_Agrawal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parag Agrawal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter,_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1229893101.jpg?resize=1200,675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720422", "eventUri": "eng-9720422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

In the aftermath of Musk's takeover and his subsequent job cuts at the social media company, X faced a number of lawsuits from Twitter's former employees. One of these lawsuits has recently ruled in Musk and X's favor.\n\nThe lawsuit alleged that Musk and X owe at least $500 million in severance pay to about 6,000 ex-Twitter workers under the provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), as noted in a Bloomberg News report. The lawsuit was filed by Courtney McMillian, Twitter's former \"head of total rewards,\" as well as another ex-manager.\n\nAs noted in a previous BBC report, Twitter's severance plan indicates that staff are entitled to receive a minimum of two months base salary plus a cash contribution towards health insurance and other benefits. Those with senior roles, on the other hand, including McMillian herself, were due six months base salary in severance pay plus one week for each full year of experience.\n\nUnder Musk, Twitter staff who were terminated following Musk's takeover received \"at most\" three months of pay. This includes one month of severance and two months of pay to comply with US law. Elon Musk mentioned this in a post on X in November 2022, when he stated that \"everyone exited was offered 3 months of severance, which is 50% more than legally required.\"\n\nUS District Judge Trina Thompson in San Francisco noted on Tuesday that the former Twitter employees' claims were not covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. As per the judge, this was due to Twitter informing employees following Musk's takeover that any worker who would be exiting the company would only receive cash payouts.\n\nWhile Elon Musk and X won the suit that was filed by Twitter's former head of total rewards, several other cases that are of similar nature are still ongoing.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact us with news tips.

But other Twitter layoff lawsuits are ongoing.\n\nTwitter/X owner Elon Musk has won a lawsuit fired Twitter employee Courtney McMillian brought against Musk and the company last year.\n\nThe suit alleged that 6,000 fired Twitter staff were owed $500 million or more in collective severance pay. The judge dismissed the lawsuit Tuesday, writing that the claims, made under US ERISA law, did not apply to the case. Therefore, no such payments were applicable. ERISA, or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, is a federal law that sets minimum requirements for health and retirement plans.\n\nMcMillian, who previously oversaw Twitter's employee benefits programs as its Head of People Experience, had claimed that Musk and X didn't adequately inform staff about their severance plan changes and didn't adhere to the severance plan set up before Musk bought Twitter. McMillian and other laid-off staff reportedly only received one month's severance pay before being forced out in November 2022 after Musk's takeover.\n\nThe judge, however, concluded that X did tell fired staff that the old plan was dead and Musk's cash-only severance plan was the only one applicable.\n\n\"After the takeover or merger, there were only cash payments promised. There were no promises to continue healthcare benefits or outplacement services provided by a third-party,\" the judge's decision states.\n\nMcMillian can still file another, amended suit against Musk if she believes a breach of contract or other violation has occurred, but won't be able to use the ERISA law to back it up, the judge said. An amended filing could tie this lawsuit to one of three other pending cases from other laid-off Twitter employees, who are also suing Musk and X for similar reasons.\n\nMusk and his companies face a range of lawsuits, but the Tesla CEO may be about to get a massive $56 billion pay package.

They claim that the \"severance Twitter has offered to date is a fraction of what employees are entitled to as Plan participants,\" and they wanted to represent a class defined as all participants in the severance plan who were terminated from Twitter after Musk bought the company in October 2022. They alleged that \"terminated employees remain entitled to no less than $500 million.\"\n\nTwitter, now X Corp., claimed that the company did not maintain a severance plan governed by ERISA. Plaintiffs claimed that for several years before the Musk takeover, there was a \"formalized policy\" and pointed to \"documents that provide a uniform and detailed policy framework for the numerous post-termination benefits Twitter provided to employees.\" Plaintiffs said employees were promised severance based on the reason of departure, length of tenure, job level, department, issuance of stock units, and other factors.\n\nNo discretion\n\nTo be governed by ERISA, a severance plan must be an \"ongoing administrative program for processing claims and paying benefits.\" The Twitter plan doesn't qualify, Thompson wrote in an order granting Musk's motion to dismiss.\n\nA severance plan with a single lump sum payment can be governed by ERISA under certain conditions, Thompson wrote. Under a precedent cited by plaintiffs, a severance plan can be covered by ERISA if lump-sum payments are based on a discretionary analysis performed on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"Here, by contrast, Twitter paid and offered to pay severance payments based on basic employment criteria that involved mathematical calculations, which does not involve a 'case-by-case' analysis or 'discretionary application' of the Twitter severance benefits' terms,\" Thompson wrote. \"Twitter's payments were 'fixed, due at known times, and [did] not depend on contingencies outside the employee's control.'\"\n\nThompson found that the relevant severance plan is the one applied after the Musk takeover. She wrote that \"the operative complaint's facts do not show that there was any discretion required in determining which employees were eligible because all employees qualified for the severance plan upon termination due to the acquisition and subsequent merger.\"\n\nThere was also no discretion in bonuses for laid-off employees \"because there was a formula for calculating severance payments that staff could apply before issuing payment.\" Thompson dismissed the ERISA claims and said that any attempt to amend those claims \"would be futile.\"\n\nOther severance lawsuits still alive\n\nPlaintiffs can file an amended complaint but only for non-ERISA claims, such as breach of contract or promissory estoppel. An amended complaint may \"state claims based on the deficient severance benefits offered or provided to terminated employees pursuant to the severance plan that applied due to the 2022 and 2023 mass layoffs,\" Thompson wrote.\n\nIf plaintiffs go that route, \"this Court will consider issuing an Order finding this case related to one of the cases currently pending, such as Cornet,\" Thompson wrote. If the case is found to be related to Cornet, it could be transferred to the District of Delaware, where Cornet is being heard.\n\nThe Cornet v. Twitter lawsuit alleges violations of the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The lawsuit says that Twitter did not give all employees the required 60 days' advance written notice before layoffs, and that Twitter did not give payments in lieu of the notice.\n\nBoth cases concern Twitter's allegedly \"deficient severance payments following mass layoffs in November 2022, December 2022, February 2023, and September 2023,\" Thompson noted.\n\nIn addition to alleged WARN Act violations, the Cornet suit claims that Twitter violated promises made during the months before Musk completed the acquisition. As Thompson wrote, the \"Cornet plaintiffs assert contract-based claims for severance benefits on behalf of a nationwide putative class of X Corp employees and former employees that had been promised that 'if there were layoffs, employees would receive benefits and severance at least as favorable as the benefits and severance that Twitter previously provided to employees.'\"\n\nIn September 2023, Musk's X Corp. agreed to settlement talks on arbitration claims from about 2,000 employees laid off after the sale.

One such suit relates to the more than 6,000 employees laid off by Musk following his acquisition of the company - and his alleged failure to pay them their full severance. Yesterday, Musk notched over his former employees.\n\nThe case in question is a class-action filed by former Twitter employee Courtney McMillian. The complaint argued that under the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the Twitter Severance Plan owed laid off workers three months of pay. They received less than that, and sought $500 million in unpaid severance. However, on Tuesday, US District Judge Trina Thompson in the Northern District of California Musk's motion to dismiss the class-action complaint.\n\nJudge Thompson found that the Twitter severance plan did not qualify under ERISA because they received notice of a separate payout scheme prior to the layoffs. Instead, she dismissed the case, ruling that the severance program adopted after Musk's takeover was the one that applied to these former employees, rather than the 2019 one the plaintiffs were expecting.\n\nThis ruling is a setback for the thousands of dismissed Twitter staffers, but there are future chances for them to win larger payments. Thompson's order noted that the plaintiffs could amend their complaint for non-ERISA claims. If they do, Thompson said \"this Court will consider issuing an Order finding this case related to one of the cases currently pending\" against X Corp/Twitter.

This ruling marks a significant legal victory for Musk, who purchased Twitter in 2022 and swiftly implemented major changes, including the termination of thousands of employees. These actions have led to numerous lawsuits from former staff and vendors who allege the company did not honor promised payments.\n\nThe dismissed lawsuit was filed in 2023 by Courtney McMillian, the former head of total rewards at Twitter, now renamed X by Musk. McMillian's complaint alleged that the company only provided one month's pay as severance instead of the more generous benefits, which included at least two months of salary and contributions toward health insurance that were previously promised.\n\nMusk's legal team argued that the claims did not fall under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which sets standards for private health and pension plans. Judge Thompson agreed, stating that the act did not apply as claimed by the plaintiffs.\n\nDespite this ruling, other lawsuits related to Musk's takeover of Twitter are still pending. These include cases brought by former company leaders and other staff members, which are progressing through the courts. Judge Thompson noted that although her court lacked jurisdiction, the plaintiffs might find recourse in other ongoing cases related to wage and severance disputes.\n\nA spokesperson for McMillian's legal team expressed disappointment with the ruling and indicated they are considering their options for moving forward. This sentiment underscores the ongoing tension and legal challenges that Musk and Twitter/X continue to face post-acquisition.\n\nThe severance issue has been a focal point of contention since Musk's acquisition. The rapid restructuring and layoffs were part of Musk's broader strategy to reshape the company, which has included rebranding and significant shifts in operational practices. The controversy around severance pay highlights the broader implications of corporate takeovers and the legal frameworks that govern employee rights and compensation.\n\nThis case underscores the complexities involved in severance agreements and the importance of clearly defined legal protections for employees. It also illustrates the potential challenges employers face when implementing large-scale layoffs and restructuring efforts.\n\nAs Twitter, now X, continues to evolve under Musk's leadership, the company must navigate these legal challenges while striving to maintain operational stability and growth. The outcome of ongoing and future lawsuits will likely impact not only the company's financial health but also its reputation and employee relations.\n\nThe dismissal of the $500 million severance lawsuit represents a notable legal win for Elon Musk amidst the broader context of his controversial takeover of Twitter. As additional cases progress through the courts, the ultimate resolution of these legal battles will be critical in shaping the future landscape for both Musk's enterprises and corporate governance at large.", "source": {"uri": "bbntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "bbntimes.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "azamat_abdoullaev@bbntimes.com", "name": "Azamat Abdoullaev", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Industrial relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corporate governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeover", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Takeover"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Whistleblowing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.bbntimes.com/images/articles/society/Elon_Musk_Prevails_in_500M_Severance_Lawsuit_by_Former_Twitter_Staff.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720422", "eventUri": "eng-9720422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Who Will Receive How Much Severance Pay?", "body": "Millions of employees focused on the new severance pay ceiling after July civil servant salary increase rates were announced. In the January-June period, the severance pay ceiling was applied as 35 thousand 58 lira and 58 kuru\u015f. Considering the increase rate calculated according to the announced inflation data, the severance pay ceiling fee increased. So, how much will the severance pay ceiling be in 2024?\n\nAlong with the civil servant raise, those who leave their jobs and are entitled to severance pay, including retirement, will also receive an increase in their wages. The increase rates were announced with the announcement of June inflation figures. Cem K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 from Milliyet newspaper wrote the details.\n\nSeverance pay is the compensation a worker receives when he leaves or is fired from the workplace where he has worked for a certain period of time. According to the Labor Law No. 4857, a worker must have worked in the same workplace for at least one year in order to receive severance pay. In calculating severance pay, the employee's 30-day gross wage for each year of employment is taken as basis.\n\nSeverance pay ceiling determines the maximum amount of severance pay to be paid to workers. This ceiling is set by the state and is usually updated annually. The purpose of setting the ceiling is to prevent employers from being placed under excessive financial burden and at the same time to ensure that workers receive reasonable compensation.\n\nOne of the most fundamental issues in working life is severance pay. According to the Financial and Social Rights Circular published by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance last week, the ceiling amount of severance pay to be paid to workers as of 01.07.2024 increased to 41.828,42 TL. Severance pay, which is entitled to certain conditions, is an extremely important monetary right for employees during their unemployment period or retirement. For employers, it is among the costs of employing workers.\n\nAn important issue in terms of severance pay is that the ceiling amount for severance pay increases every year in January and July. So what does the increase in the severance pay ceiling mean? Severance pay is calculated based on the worker's gross wage, but cannot exceed the severance pay ceiling. The severance pay ceiling is determined according to the 1-year retirement bonus of the Prime Ministry Undersecretary, who is the highest-ranking civil servant.\n\nThe severance pay ceiling increases in January and July. Therefore, if employees have the right to access severance pay by resigning, that is, if they will leave their job due to marriage, military service or 15 years and 3.600 days, it will be in their favor to use this right in January and July.\n\nIncreasing the severance pay ceiling is important for employees whose gross wages are above the ceiling. When the ceiling increases, the amount of severance pay that employees in this situation will receive also increases.\n\nAccording to the Financial and Social Rights Circular published by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance in January, this figure was 2024 thousand 6 liras and 35 kuru\u015f for the first 58 months of 58. For the period from July 1 to December 31, this amount increased to 41 thousand 828 liras and 42 kuru\u015f. Therefore, even if a worker's gross wage based on severance pay is 60 thousand TL, the maximum amount to be taken into account in calculating the severance pay to be given in the second period of 2024 will be 41 thousand 828 lira and 42 kuru\u015f for each year of seniority.\n\nThe right to severance pay is a right granted to workers. In this context, 4/a employees may be entitled to severance pay. All workers, except workers working under the Code of Obligations, have the right to receive severance pay. On the other hand, Ba\u011f-Kur members and civil servants do not have the right to receive severance pay. Journalists and seamen working under the Press Labor and Maritime Labor Law also have the right to receive severance pay.\n\nTermination of a worker's employment contract for reasons specified in the law is not sufficient for him to receive severance pay. In addition, there is a requirement to have worked for the same employer for at least 1 year. In other words, even if an employee's employment contract is terminated or resigned for the reasons listed in the law, he cannot receive severance pay if he has not worked for the same employer for at least 1 year.\n\nIn calculating the 1-year period required for the employee to receive severance pay, the periods worked in different workplaces affiliated with the same employer are evaluated together. For example, an employee who has worked for (A) his employer (B) in the workplace for 4 months and (C) in the workplace for 9 months is entitled to severance pay. What is important at this point is that workplaces (B) and (C) belong to the same employer. On the other hand, if the employee has worked for less than 1 year in workplaces affiliated with different employers, he/she is not entitled to severance pay.\n\nThe trial period is also taken into account when calculating the 1-year period. If there is a period in which the worker was employed without insurance, even this period should be taken into account in the calculation of severance pay. Therefore, a period of 1 year begins to run from the time when workers first start working at the workplace. The fact that this period is a trial period or that the worker's insurance is not paid during this period does not change the result.\n\nThe severance pay the employee is entitled to is equal to 1 days' gross salary for each year of employment. Therefore, a worker with 30 year of seniority is entitled to severance pay equal to 1 month's gross wage. For periods under 1 year, calculations are made proportionally. Continuous benefits and premiums are also included when calculating the worker's gross wage. For this reason, payments such as cash compensation, food allowance, child raise are included in the worker's gross wage, and severance pay is calculated based on this wage. On the other hand, severance pay is not subject to income tax. Only stamp duty is deducted from severance pay.", "source": {"uri": "raillynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RayHaber | RaillyNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severance (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru\u015f", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuru\u015f"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_lira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkish lira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HM Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Employment contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proportional representation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamp_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stamp duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://rayhaber.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Kidem-Tazminati-Tavani-Degisti-Mi-Kim-Ne-Kadar-Kidem-Tazminati-Alacak.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720422", "eventUri": "eng-9720422", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "dateEnd": "-12-31", "textStart": 3175, "textEnd": 3196}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Musk's lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.\n\nThe case is one of many accusing Musk of reneging on promises to former Twitter employees, including former Chief Executive Parag Agrawal, and vendors after buying the company for $44 billion in October 2022.\n\nMusk also runs the electric car company Tesla, and is the world's richest person, according to Forbes magazine.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Twitter's 2019 severance plan called for employees who stayed on after the buyout to receive two or six months of pay, plus one week of pay for each year of employment, if they were laid off.\n\nThe plaintiffs Courtney McMillian, who oversaw Twitter's compensation and benefits, and Ronald Cooper, an operations manager, said Twitter instead offered fired employees just one month of pay as severance, with no benefits.\n\nThompson said ERISA didn't apply to Twitter's post-buyout plan because there was no \"ongoing administrative scheme\" where the company reviewed claims case-by-case, or offered benefits such as continued health insurance and out placement services.\n\n\"There were only cash payments promised,\" she wrote.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiffs can try amending their complaint, but only for claims not governed by ERISA.\n\nThe case is McMillian et al v.

X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe EU's DSA and the Digital Markets Act, or DMA, are two freshly minted laws that take aim at the most powerful online platforms.\n\nThe EU has now ramped up enforcement of its new powers.\n\nThe DSA became legally enforceable last August, laying out content rules for social media platforms, online marketplaces and app stores.\n\nIt forces their owners to clamp down on misinformation and objectionable content such as hate speech, terrorist propaganda and ads for unsafe toys.\n\nRegulators have also homed in on the creation of so-called rabbit holes on social media, which suck young users deeper and deeper into often inappropriate material.\n\nThe DMA regulation took hold on March 7, hitting big tech firms with a broad list of dos and don'ts based on decades of antitrust enforcement in the digital economy.\n\nThe aim is to stop abusive conduct before its takes hold and allows the digital giants firms to dominate markets.\n\nThe EU has just issued formal warnings to Apple Inc. and Meta over allegedly unfair practices under the DMA.", "source": {"uri": "mybroadband.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title":

Senior employees, meanwhile, were owed upwards of six months of base pay, according to the lawsuit. However, plaintiffs claimed that Twitter only gave the laid-off workers just one month of pay, with no benefits.", "source": {"uri": "fastcompany.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fast Company"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_bursztynsky@fastcompany.com", "name": "Jessica Bursztynsky", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_Retirement_Income_Security_Act_of_1974", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintiff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plaintiff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human Resources", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Employee_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Employee Relations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Labor-Management Relations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2024/07/p-1-91154316-Elon-Musk-does-not-owe-ex-Twitter-staffers-500-million-in-severance-court-rules.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720422", "eventUri": "eng-9720422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 458347980, "relevance": 2}

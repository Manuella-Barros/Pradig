{"id": 225044310, "title": "We're adding to our geopolitical hedge and a struggling health-care stock", "text": "We are buying 55 shares of Abbott Laboratories at roughly $100.89 and 200 shares of Coterra Energy at roughly $27.44. Following the trades, Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust will own 950 shares of ABT, increasing its weighting to 3.00% from 2.84% and 3,100 shares of CTRA, increasing its weighting to 2.65% from 2.48%. We're putting some cash to work into the down open Wednesday. Once again, we are adding to our position in Abbott Labs. The stock continues to slide along with many other names in health care as investors focus mainly on the artificial intelligence trade. Abbott may be out of favor right now, but we're willing to be patient because it's high quality and one of the fastest growing companies in the medical-technology industry. In the first quarter of 2024, Abbott posted organic sales growth of 10.8%. It may not be an AI infrastructure buildout beneficiary, but double-digit growth for a roughly $175 billion market cap company is still pretty impressive. There is an Abbott-specific overhang to keep in mind: litigation concerns for its baby formula business. While we cannot dismiss this as a potential risk that could linger for months, many analysts think the market capitalization that has been lost in recent months on these concerns far exceeds what Abbott could ultimately pay to settle. We continue to believe this disconnect creates an opportunity to slowly buy this Dividend Aristocrat on weakness. We're adding to Coterra because we want to more energy exposure on our books due to the rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Coterra Energy has been our long preferred name due to its capital efficiency and ability to flex investment between oil and natural gas \u2013 whatever is most economical based on commodity prices. There's also a lot of consolidation happening in the sector. The latest news is ConocoPhillips buying Marathon Oil at a premium of nearly 15%. Although we never buy stocks simply for mergers-and-acquisitions reasons, Coterra's pristine balance sheet puts it in a good position to scale up operations if it wants to, and its cheap valuation could make it a target of a larger company.

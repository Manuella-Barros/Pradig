(Shaban Athuman/Richmond Times-Dispatch via AP)\n\nThe Washington Redskins return to action Saturday night, hosting the Green Bay Packers for the second game of the preseason at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe starters are expected to see a more significant workload than the six-play (for the offense) and three-play (defense) sampling they received in last week's loss to Baltimore.\n\nThis early on, every player on the roster has something to prove. But here's a look at five key players who can help themselves with improved showings against Green Bay:\n\n1. Kirk Cousins, QB: Despite not having his full cast of receivers, Kirk Cousins said last week that he looked forward to the challenge of showing he could direct a highly functioning offense regardless of the weapons. But instead, Cousins and the offense went three-and-out twice, and the quarterback completed just one pass. That feeble showing sparked some unrest, and Redskins players and coaches called the showing a wake-up call.\n\n[Underappreciated by fans but loved by coaches, Ryan Grant is set for an expanded role]\n\nJay Gruden rode his players harder in practice this past week, and now it's redemption time. Yes, it's just the preseason, but the Redskins badly want to look better than they did against Baltimore. It's not yet clear how long Gruden will play his starters. But Cousins says he understands the importance of a fast start, and wants to bounce back against Green Bay.\n\n2. Samaje Perine, RB: Gruden said the thing that frustrated him most about last week's outing was the 2.1-yard-per-carry average his rushing unit produced. The coach wants a physical rushing attack to complement the passing game. Obviously, the run game also involves the offensive linemen, but running backs Rob Kelley and Perine need to come away from this game with some positives.\n\nKelley still has a firm grasp on the starting job. But Perine needs to show growth. He needs to display improved ball security after fumbling last week, and he needs to run with more confidence and explosiveness. Displaying improvement in pass protection also will go a long way toward helping the fourth-round pick earn playing time this season.\n\n3. Josh Doctson, WR: The Redskins hope to get their 2016 first-round pick on the field in a game for the first time since Week 2 of last season. Recovered from the Achilles' tendon injuries that sidelined him last season, Doctson looked good during the early going of training camp. But a hamstring injury kept him from playing in the preseason opener.\n\nDoctson had expressed encouragement that he had managed to prove he could stay healthy, then he got hurt again. He needs to find the fine line between knowing how to play through soreness, and when to sit with injury. Trainers and coaches plan to test him out pregame and see how he feels. But the hope is that he can play and begin showing why Washington used the 22nd overall pick on him last year.\n\n[The Redskins face an NFL-wide question: Are they practicing hard enough?]\n\n4. Mason Foster, ILB: The inside linebacker position has garnered great attention because of the three-way battle that has taken place for two starting jobs. Last week, incumbents Will Compton and Mason Foster got the nod last week, but then on the second defensive stand, it was Compton and Zach Brown -- the 2016 Pro Bowl selection who ranked second in the league in tackles for Buffalo and signed with Washington this offseason.\n\nBrown flew around making plays both against the run and the pass. It seems like Brown is close to lining up the \"Moe\" position, but best friends Foster and Compton remain in a heated competition. This week, Foster will get the start at the \"mike\" linebacker spot instead of Compton. Foster didn't play this position for Washington the last season and a half, but did do so in Tampa the first four seasons of his career. Coaches value Compton's smarts and leadership, but this is a chance for Foster to prove that he can fill this role.\n\n5. Preston Smith, OLB: The 2015 second-round pick endured a sophomore slump, managing just 4.5 sacks in 2016. So, the Redskins spent a second-round pick on outside linebacker Ryan Anderson this year, and the Alabama product has looked good. Junior Galette also has looked good while working his way back from a pair of torn Achilles tendons. Smith didn't get off to a strong start in camp, and then missed the first preseason game with an ankle injury. He needs to go out there Saturday night and have a strong performance -- otherwise, he could wind up losing his starting job.\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nJunior Galette's injuries have taught him patience. Now he's preaching that to Redskins fans.\n\nFor five years, a Richmond local has made a one-man stand against the Redskins' name\n\nJay Gruden rules out four players for Saturday's game; Doctson a game-time decision", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T18:14:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7882353067398071, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3372615", "time": "18:14:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3372615", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 4}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 3}, {"id": "310124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Washington Redskins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins", "score": 5}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 1}, {"id": "311041", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "score": 2}, {"id": "314205", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "score": 4}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 4}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 3}, {"id": "336932", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Outside linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker#Types_of_linebackers", "score": 1}, {"id": "351209", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Richmond Times-Dispatch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Times-Dispatch", "score": 4}, {"id": "351349", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "score": 5}, {"id": "351350", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jay Gruden"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Gruden", "score": 3}, {"id": "379666", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Junior Galette"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Galette", "score": 1}, {"id": "380073", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Middle linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker#Middle_linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "380861", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mason Foster"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Foster", "score": 2}, {"id": "382911", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ryan Grant"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Grant", "score": 3}, {"id": "500201", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zach Brown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Brown", "score": 2}, {"id": "1271477", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Samaje Perine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaje_Perine", "score": 4}, {"id": "1278072", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Will Compton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Compton", "score": 2}, {"id": "1296411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Josh Doctson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Doctson", "score": 2}, {"id": "1326888", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "2016 Pro Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Pro_Bowl", "score": 2}], "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-08-06/AP/Redskins_Football_76073-bde1e.jpg?t=20170517", "timeCrawl": "18:14:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Analysis | Five Redskins players with something to prove in Saturday's game versus the Packers", "originalArticle": null}

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThe order of the depth chart is the biggest puzzle for the Redskins as they prepare to host the Packers for a preseason game at FedEx Field on Saturday (7:30, CSN).\n\nThe biggest battle for a starting job is at inside linebacker, but coach Jay Gruden will spend most of his time evaluating reserves.\n\nThe Redskins have more depth than in past years, so making the final 53-man roster Sept. 2 has gotten tougher. That means performing well in the preseason is vital for potential second- or third-stringers.\n\nExpect starters to play into the second quarter. Here are five players to watch.\n\nMason Foster\n\nThree players are competing for two spots at inside linebacker, and Will Compton has an edge because he called defensive signals last year. The Redskins are still trying different combinations, and coach Jay Gruden said he'll start Zach Brown and Foster against the Packers. Both played very well in the preseason opener at Baltimore, but Washington probably didn't sign Brown from Buffalo just for depth. Foster is still the starter on paper, but he has seemed like a stopgap solution since he was signed during the 2015 season. In his seventh season, Foster still has upside as a run defender.\n\n[Three takeaways from Redskins' Thursday practice: A shake-up at ILB]\n\nKendall Fuller\n\nAs the No. 3 corner and top nickel back, Fuller could set himself up to start next year if Bashaud Breeland, who becomes a free agent in 2018, doesn't earn a new deal. Coaches have been impressed with Fuller's improvement since last year, when offseason surgery slowed his development as a rookie but he still started six games. He's known as a cerebral player, which is perfect for a slot corner. Fuller was a little uneven against Baltimore, but he should improve as the season goes on. The big question is whether he can cover the league's best receivers.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden has raved about fifth-round pick Jeremy Sprinkle, but there may not be room for him on the 53-man roster. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nJeremy Sprinkle\n\nGruden can't stop praising Washington's fifth-round pick, saying Sprinkle will have a long career. So if the Redskins carry four tight ends, that could include Jordan Reed, Vernon Davis, Niles Paul and Sprinkle, which would leave out Derek Carrier. But Gruden has good things to say about Carrier, too, so Sprinkle needs a strong camp to avoid the practice squad. At 6 feet 5 and 252 pounds, Sprinkle is like a larger Don Warren, who blocked next to the famed \"Hogs.\" Sprinkle has good hands, too, so he could be a nice safety valve in the red zone for Kirk Cousins.\n\nMatt Jones\n\nConsider this Jones' last chance to prove he's worth keeping. Last year's Week 1 starter was benched after he fumbled three times in seven games. He was considered a long shot to make this year's roster entering camp, and finishing with -1 yard on three carries against Baltimore was embarrassing. The backup offensive line gave him no holes, but Jones should have pushed Ravens reserves for yardage. A good effort against Green Bay might get him a temporary stay, but it could also interest another team into signing the former third-round pick.\n\n[Five areas to monitor as the Redskins prepare for Packers in second preseason game]\n\nNico Marley\n\nThe undrafted free agent was thought to be an extra body entering camp. But after a solid debut versus Baltimore, the diminutive grandson of Bob Marley is earning a second look. Marley (5 feet 8, 200 pounds) had four tackles including a sack in 38 snaps versus the Ravens, and he showed excellent instincts and speed.

(AP Photo/Steve Helber)\n\nThe Washington Redskins had what would equate to a Friday practice on usual game weeks.\n\nInstead of running the starting offense versus the starting defense as they have all of camp, the first units practiced against the scout teams, which operated off of play calls to provide the looks the Packers likely will feature on Saturday.\n\nThis is the usual custom for the second and third weeks of the preseason, and the regular season, even though the starters will not play the entire game.\n\n[Gruden rules out four players for Saturday's game against Packers]\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said he still hasn't decided how much the starters will play against the Packers at FedEx Field. But he plans to use them for more than the six-play sampling (offense) and the three plays (defense) of the preseason opener.\n\n\"You know, it'll be a feeling out there on Saturday, really,\" Gruden said. \"I intend on them playing a little bit more than normal, probably, but we'll see how it goes.\"\n\nHere's a look at some of the top areas that stood out in today's practice:\n\n1. Step forward on offense? - Top returning wide receiver Jamison Crowder received a full workload yet again, and the plan is for him to make his preseason debut after missing the opener with a hamstring injury. It means that Kirk Cousins and the offense will take another step toward returning to full strength.\n\n[What exactly do special teamers do during training camp?]\n\nWithout their full collection of weapons, the Redskins haven't gotten a clear look at where things stand offensively. But with Crowder starting opposite Terrelle Pryor on Saturday, things should improve. Those two will start, and then in three-receiver formations, Ryan Grant will take over on the outside and Crowder will move to the slot. There's still no Jordan Reed, but there's a chance Josh Doctson could play as well. (They'll test his hamstring out during pre-game warmups to make a final determination).\n\nCrowder has looked good in practice, winning matchups against Josh Norman when lined up outside, and Kendall Fuller or linebackers or safeties when lined up in the slot. He has used crisp route-running to shake the likes of Norman and Fuller, and speed to win against linebackers and safeties. When Reed returns, the offense will run through him, but until then, Crowder is option No. 1, so it'll be interesting to see how Cousins and Crowder look from a timing perspective despite limited practice time.\n\n2. Game plan at ILB - We took a look at the inside linebacker competition this morning, and for a second straight day, it was Mason Foster at the \"Mike\" and Zach Brown at the \"Moe.\" Will Compton will serve as Foster's backup.\n\nGruden said after practice that those two will indeed start against Green Bay. Foster looks comfortable as the signal caller, and because of his physicality, he has the ability to shed blockers and get to the ball carrier. In previous weeks, we've seen times where Brown has come off the bench to take over alongside Will Compton in nickel packages. But in the last two practices, Brown and Foster have remained on the field together whether in base or nickel. Compton got on the field for one first-team play today, but spent the rest of the day leading the second unit.\n\n3. More D-line shuffling - Jim Tomsula's experimentation in the trenches continues. While the starters at linebacker (Ryan Kerrigan, Foster, Brown, Preston Smith), cornerback (Josh Norman, Bashaud Breeland) and safety (D.J. Swearinger, Will Blackmon, standing in for Deshazor Everett, who missed practice to attend to a personal matter) all remained the same, the defensive linemen changed every series.\n\nIn a rare occurrence, Terrell McClain got the start at left defensive end after spending the bulk of the preseason as a backup. Meanwhile, Ziggy Hood at nose tackle (instead of Phil Taylor, who has been the regular), and Jonathan Allen played right end, as he has many times.\n\nLater, in the nickel package, we saw McClain and Anthony Lanier as the two linemen. Lanier has been a regular here. A.J. Francis and Stacy McGee got snaps in the nickel with the first-team defense, as did Joey Mbu and Hood. Later still, Matt Ioannidis and Allen were paired together. Tomsula has said the starters don't matter, because everyone is going to play, and he appears to be sticking to his word. It's always hard to truly gauge defensive linemen in practice because of the lack of live tackling. But we'll see how these paring work on Saturday.\n\nThe player with the most to prove would seem to be McClain, who has yet to really show why the Redskins signed him this offseason.\n\nMore on the Redskins\n\nWhat exactly do the special teams players do while their teammates battle for roster spots?\n\nThree takeaways from Wednesday's practice in Ashburn\n\nSurvey says: Redskins last in D.C. area in fan experience\n\nFive things to watch for as Redskins ready for Packers\n\nKirk Cousins tells ESPN he 'would love to be' Redskin for life.

(John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nIn the week that followed a 23-3 preseason loss to the Ravens, an outcome that underscored how far the Washington Redskins have to go before their Week 1 opener at FedEx Field on Sept. 10, nothing much changed at practice.\n\nThere was a bit more urgency in Coach Jay Gruden's commands. \"Let's go, now!\" the coach bellowed after the horn sounded the start of 11-on-11 drills during Thursday's session. \"We're trying to win here! We're trying to win!\"\n\nAnd there was a bit of game-planning with Saturday's preseason opponent in mind, as the Redskins' first-team offense lined up against a scout team tasked with mimicking the Green Bay Packers' defense, and the first-team defense faced scout-teamers posing as the Aaron Rodgers-led offense.\n\nBut for the most part, the Aug. 10 embarrassment at Baltimore didn't force a major rethinking of the Redskins' approach to practice. Rather, Gruden suggested, the defeat reflected a lack of focus and intensity that fell on him.\n\n\"We're still preparing the same way,\" Gruden said, when asked what he had changed after a loss he and quarterback Kirk Cousins characterized as \"a wake-up call.\" \"I just think everybody has to come out and understand the other team has an agenda, also. We didn't match the same agenda, and that's probably my fault.\"\n\nHeading into his fourth season in Washington, Gruden, 50, has accomplished something no coach has since Daniel Snyder bought the team in 1999 -- earning a contract extension, awarded in March, for the steady progress that produced the Redskins' first back-to-back winning season in 19 years.\n\n[Packers hope another light preseason for Aaron Rodgers doesn't mean another slow start]\n\nBut Gruden has yet to win a season opener. His teams have started 1-2 in each of his three seasons, forced to play from behind in what has become an annual scramble to make the playoffs. (That, too, has been a 1-2 proposition.) The pattern of slow starts raises questions about whether the Redskins work hard enough in their three-week training camp in Richmond and in the two weeks of practice that follow at their own facility in Ashburn -- and whether their inability to schedule joint practices with another NFL team either of the last two years leaves them at a competitive disadvantage.\n\nGruden doesn't hide from the fact that he could demand more tackling and blocking drills than he does. The balance he strikes is made with full awareness of the risk of getting players injured versus the reward of getting them ready for the hard-hitting regular season.\n\nWashington guard Shawn Lauvao (77) hits a large boxing heavy bag after an afternoon practice on August 8. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nThroughout the NFL, it's a calculus that all coaches are working out.\n\nMidway through Thursday's patchy preseason tilt between Tampa Bay and Jacksonville, Michael Lombardi, a former NFL personnel executive with Cleveland, Philadelphia and Oakland and assistant to New England's coaching staff, mused on Twitter that it has gotten to the point where football fans can't honestly judge teams until mid-October. \"So many coaches are more worried about injuries than getting their team ready,\" Lombardi tweeted.\n\nThere is reason behind their thinking. It's far more important to a team's success (and a head coach's job security) to have its best players healthy for the 16 games that count than risk losing them in the preseason.\n\nEven the most hard-driving coaches are now restrained by NFL rules limiting the amount of contact in training camp. In the interest of players' safety, teams can only hold one practice in helmets and pads daily during camp, and that session must be limited to two hours.\n\n[The last time Tom Brady had a receiver like Brandin Cooks the Patriots nearly went undefeated]\n\nThat's considerably less hitting than existed in Doug Williams' era (1978-89) and even a decade ago, when Redskins safety Will Blackmon was a young defensive back.\n\n\"I participated in two-a-day [practices] in Green Bay during camp, and I'm talking about two full practices,\" recalled Blackmon, 32. Asked if it was beneficial, Blackmon didn't hesitate. \"No! It was rough! Guys were getting hurt! I feel like coaches across the league have a better understanding that if their guys aren't healthy, you're not gonna have a beneficial season.\"\n\nWilliams, who earned Super Bowl MVP honors in the Redskins' 42-10 rout of Denver to cap the 1987 season, declined to weigh in on the question of whether the current limitations on camp make it more difficult to prepare a team for the regular season. But he was quick to add that it's no excuse for performing poorly in the preseason.\n\n\"The same rules apply to every team in this league, so we can't use that as an excuse,\" said Williams, the Redskins executive vice president for player personnel. \"We just have got to be cognizant of it and train the guys, 'Hey, this is what has to happen [when play begins].'\"\n\nDespite the restrictions on the physicality and duration of training camp, there are variables that can make one camp more productive than another. Among them: Maximizing the allotted time.\n\nFor the Redskins, the daily portion of practice dedicated to special-teams work is an opportunity for other players to relax. Some do just that, while others, such as wide receiver Terrelle Pryor, spend it doing drills on their own.\n\nHouston Texans running back Lamar Miller (26) looks to get past New England Patriots defensive back Duron Harmon (30) during the two teams' joint practice on August 16. (Chris Jackson/AP)\n\nRunning back Chris Thompson still has vivid memory of the way the Patriots ended practice when New England visited Redskins camp in Richmond for a two-day joint workout in 2014. As the Redskins trudged to the showers, Patriots players marched to an adjacent field en masse, lined up shoulder-to-shoulder on a sideline and did wind sprints.\n\n\"I paid attention to what they did,\" Thompson recalls. \"We had just had a full, two-hour practice, but they went and lined up and did these sprints. It just happened! They did it and never questioned it.\"\n\nAnd then there's the issue of joint practices themselves. For many NFL teams, holding practice with a rival during training camp has become a key part of their preparation. The Redskins did so in 2014 and 2015 but haven't since, finding it difficult to locate a team willing to visit their camp in Richmond without a reciprocal visit in subsequent years. The Redskins are precluded from visiting other camps under the eight-year contract they signed to hold training camp in Richmond.\n\nThe Patriots have held joint practices for the last six years. This summer, the five-time Super Bowl champions scrimmaged against two teams -- hosting Jacksonville for a joint practice Aug. 7-8 then visiting Houston's training camp in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, for a two-day scrimmage earlier this week.\n\n\"The old saying goes, 'Iron sharpens iron,'\" said Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, three-time NFL defensive player of the year, when asked about the merits of scrimmaging against four-time Super Bowl MVP Tom Brady. \"He's obviously one of the best quarterbacks to have ever played the game.

Swearinger) looks like he'll help; the rookies up front (end Jonathan Allen, linebacker Ryan Anderson) appear to be good picks and the free agent linebacker (Zach Brown) has started to emerge.\n\nBut this group might not receive a good test for a second consecutive preseason game. There's a chance Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers won't play Saturday, with coach Mike McCarthy holding him out for a second consecutive preseason game, just like last summer. If that happens, then the Redskins defense will have missed another starting quarterback -- and a chance to see how much they've truly improved. Baltimore's Joe Flacco did not play in the opener because of a back injury.\n\nThe Redskins' defense did play well along the front against the Ravens, a good sign regardless of the quarterback. Last week, they started ends Ziggy Hood and Stacy McGee and nose Phil Taylor in their base front. It's possible that Saturday, Hood will start at nose tackle, flanked by McGee and Terrell McClain. Matt Ioannidis and Allen opened as the tackles in nickel and could do so again Saturday. The Redskins' defense was physical in the opener.\n\nThe Redskins sat quarterback Kirk Cousins for the second game last summer, but he's expected to play Saturday. Still, how much work he gets remains uncertain. Last year, he was working with a veteran group of receivers with whom he had experience. That's not the case this summer, at least when it comes to Terrelle Pryor.\n\nThey've connected quite often in practice, but missed on Cousins' one attempt to him last week -- a high and wide throw that forced the 6-foot-4 Pryor to reach high. It would have caused Pryor to be hit hard after the play as well. They need more game experience together. Coach Jay Gruden said they have a \"lot of work to do\" in getting their on-field relationship perfected.\n\n\"But they've come a long way from when he first got here,\" Gruden said. \"Getting to know each other and the type of balls that, you know, Terrelle can handle in the red zone and all that stuff, they're still working through that. But, I like where they're going. I like their progress. I like both of them communicating and working well together.\"\n\nOther aspects to monitor vs. Green Bay:\n\nBetter blocking: Whether you want to say they must be more physical, better prepared or whatever, they need to do a better job run blocking. Last week's failure wasn't just a matter of preparation, something that was obvious when re-watching the game. On some plays the Redskins fared well, aside from longtime veterans (Trent Williams, Vernon Davis, Chris Thompson) either losing or missing their assignments. Regardless, as a group they absolutely must play more physical and at least generate some success running the ball. It's not about being a run team vs. a pass team, but it is about establishing a mindset -- and needing to be a team that can run when needed. Too often last year they struggled vs. the better run defenses, such as Baltimore. Green Bay was not as good vs. the run in 2016 and struggled with tackling in its preseason opener.\n\nLinebacker duo: The Redskins will start Zach Brown and Mason Foster in the middle. A big key will be how they believe Foster handles calling the signals and audibilizing -- and then, of course, playing. Foster played well at the end of last season. Brown's speed and athleticism were evident in the preseason opener; he'll have to be more consistent in coverage, but he can go sideline to sideline well and is tough to handle on blitzes.\n\nBackup offensive linemen: Arie Kouandjio has mostly worked with the third line for a week, putting him behind undrafted free agent rookie Kyle Kalis. Another undrafted free agent, Tyler Catalina, has worked as the No. 2 right guard. If Kouandjio showed he also could play tackle, it would help his cause. That's going to be difficult. There's a chance the Redskins will keep only three reserve offensive linemen - and only tackle Ty Nsekhe would have any experience. Rookie center Chase Roullier has consistently backed up starter Spencer Long. Tackle Vinston Painter has worked as the No. 2 right tackle. But the Redskins need their backups to be able to play another line spot in a pinch.\n\nDefensive backs: Rookie Fabian Moreau (corner) and Montae Nicholson (safety) both are available after missing the first preseason game while recovering from offseason injuries. Moreau plays an aggressive corner and has bit hard on some fakes in practice. He has starting capabilities, though when those emerge is anyone's guess. With Su'a Cravens out, Deshazor Everett will start. He's progressed nicely after switching from corner in the 2016 offseason but to this point has been viewed mostly as a backup and special-teamer.\n\nSpecial teams: Specifically, the receivers. Rookie Brian Davis made a stop in coverage, a good sign for him as he tries to win a roster spot. But that also means a lot someone such as veteran Brian Quick. The Redskins have worked him as a gunner in practices; handling that role would help him quite a bit.\n\n\"He's done a nice job [at receiver] when given those opportunities,\" Redskins receivers coach Ike Hilliard said of Quick. \"He has to clean up the mental mistakes that come with the progression of the offense. That's his biggest challenge, limiting those mistakes.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:26:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3372615", "time": "18:26:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3372615", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 5}, {"id": "309405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "score": 3}, {"id": "310124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Washington Redskins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins", "score": 4}, {"id": "310476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "score": 4}, {"id": "310752", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American football positions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions", "score": 1}, {"id": "312088", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Undrafted free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent#Undrafted_free_agent", "score": 2}, {"id": "319761", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lineman (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "322621", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "335402", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "score": 3}, {"id": "339018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "score": 3}, {"id": "339019", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy_(American_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "342533", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Joe Flacco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Flacco", "score": 3}, {"id": "349110", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trent Williams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Williams", "score": 2}, {"id": "351349", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "score": 3}, {"id": "351350", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jay Gruden"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Gruden", "score": 3}, {"id": "377506", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Su'a Cravens"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Su'a_Cravens", "score": 1}, {"id": "379307", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terrelle Pryor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrelle_Pryor", "score": 3}, {"id": "380861", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mason Foster"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Foster", "score": 2}, {"id": "410708", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vernon Davis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Davis", "score": 2}, {"id": "500201", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Zach Brown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Brown", "score": 4}, {"id": "514300", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Phil Taylor (darts player)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Taylor_(darts_player)", "score": 3}, {"id": "610001", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ziggy Hood"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziggy_Hood", "score": 3}, {"id": "1292434", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "D.

Saturday, it'll be Foster and Brown working with the starters, just as they've done the last two practices.\n\n\"After that, we'll see what happens,\" Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. \"All three of them have the qualities to play. It's just a matter of finding the right match.\"\n\nIn the opener, it was Compton and Brown. During most of camp, it was usually Compton and Foster. They offer unique skills; the question will be who works best together. Before camp, the coaches had hoped Martrell Spaight would enter the competition, but he missed time with a hamstring injury, setting him back. There's a chance that the coaches find a way to use the top three linebackers in various packages.\n\nHere's a look at the main competitors for the two jobs:\n\nBrown: The Redskins signed him to a one-year deal in the offseason after he made the Pro Bowl in his one season with Buffalo. He's fast and athletic and there's little doubt the Redskins wanted to use those skills on the field. It was a matter of when he picked up the defense -- would it be in time to start the opener? Brown played well in their limited snaps vs. Baltimore, showing range few linebackers possess. Brown hasn't called signals in the past, so he's limited to the 'Mo' linebacker spot. Brown blitzes well; he'll have to show that he can cover in man situations as well.\n\n\"Zach Brown has a skill set for playing linebacker,\" Gruden said. \"He can go sideline to sideline probably faster athletically than the majority of linebackers we have.\"\n\nBrown said, \"I feel real comfortable in the defense. I'm picking up the terminology, now I just have to go out there and play.\"\n\nFoster: He's the most versatile of the group because he can play both inside spots. Foster called signals while with Tampa Bay and will do so Saturday night. In the past, coaches felt he played better when he didn't have to worry about calling the signals.\n\n\"Mason can play both positions equally as well,\" Gruden said.\n\nCompton: Teammates rave about his leadership, as do coaches. Teammates voted him a captain last season. He started 25 games the past two years, after working his way up from undrafted status in 2013. He's adept at calling the signals and making last-second audibles.

Stay tuned. (John McDonnell / The Washington Post)\n\nWith another week of preparation under their belt, the Washington Redskins host the Green Bay Packers at 7:30 p.m. at FedEx Field.\n\nYesterday, we took a look at some of he players with the most to prove in this second preseason game. Here are five key story lines to follow tonight.\n\nOffensive production - Sure, it's only the preseason, and yes, the starters played only six plays against Baltimore. But that was not the kind of outing that anyone wants to have. Not even the second and third units produced the way they should have. As a team, Washington managed just 138 total yards and eight first downs, only two of 13 third downs converted for first downs. The Redskins averaged just 2.2 yards per rushing attempt and had an interception and three fumbles. ... It was pretty ugly. Quarterbacks Kirk Cousins, Colt McCoy, Nate Sudfeld and their teammates must do better this time around. We'll see how another week of practices, and some light game planning for Green Bay's defense, benefits the offense. Inside linebacker battle - This position battle has commanded a fair amount of ink this week. As mentioned, Mason Foster will slide over from the \"Moe\" position, where he has started the last year and a half, and start at the \"Mike,\" which is the leader and signal caller of the defense. Zach Brown will start at the \"Moe,\" and the usual starting \"Mike\" (Will Compton) will come off the bench. Coaches are still trying to figure out the best combination for these two crucial positions. Everett's opportunity - Deshazor Everett always finds a way to make the most of his opportunities. Two years ago, the undrafted Texas A&M product used strong play in the final preseason game to lock up his roster spot. He did so again in last year's preseason finale, held a key special teams role all last season, and in his most extensive regular season playing time, Everett made game-changing plays that helped Washington beat Philadelphia. Tonight, with Su'a Cravens sidelined after knee surgery, Everett will get the first start of his NFL career. He has worked hard to convert from cornerback to safety, and now he gets the chance to show how far he has come, and convince coaches that he's the best option at strong safety if Cravens gets hurt again. Backup guards - The starting offensive line is set. But backup spots remain up for grabs. Ty Nsekhe seems like a lock as the swing tackle, and rookie Chase Roullier is doing well at center. But four guards are engaged in a fight for spots. Arie Kouandjio and Isaiah Williams seem to have lost ground to Kyle Kalis and Tyler Catalina, who are now both getting the bulk of the second-team snaps. Kouandjio was a fourth-round draft pick in 2015, but coaches aren't worried about draft status as they have moved Kalis (an undrafted rooke) ahead of him. Doctson's debut? - After a promising first week of training camp, 2016 first-round pick Josh Doctson missed last week with a hamstring strain. But he's now recovered and is on target to play tonight. He'll test out his hamstring one more time during pregame warmups to be sure. If Doctson can play, it'll be only the third time that he has stepped on an NFL field. He missed all but two games last season with Achilles' tendon injuries. But in camp, he has looked smooth, he has displayed good hands, a wide catch radius and has looked like the best receiver on the team. The Redskins would like to see the TCU product in game action. So would their fans.\n\nMore on the Redskins:\n\nJosh Doctson, Ryan Anderson say they feel fine; status for Packers is TBD\n\nFive Redskins with something to prove in Saturday's preseason game\n\nThe Redskins face an NFL-wide question: Are they practicing hard enough?\n\nSafety Deshazor Everett's growth could lead to first Redskins start\n\nJunior Galette's injuries have taught him patience.

They failed. In their second preseason game, the Redskins lost to Green Bay, 21-17. That didn't matter as much as the fact that the Redskins did not generate much with its starting offense -- that's why coach Jay Gruden left them in for an entire half.\n\nQB depth chart: Starter Kirk Cousins has yet to look sharp in his two outings save for a pair of excellent throws, one to running back Chris Thompson on a wheel route and another to tight end Vernon Davis down the field. Otherwise, there's been little rhythm and timing. He needs more work with Josh Doctson and Terrelle Pryor. Cousins averaged just 6.3 yards per attempt. Colt McCoy led a touchdown drive and completed 7 of 11 passes for 64 yards on the night. Nate Sudfeld led a late drive but it stalled at the Packers' 22; he completed 6 of 11 passes for 64 yards.\n\nWhen it was starters vs. starters, the Redskins looked ...: Like a team that needs more work. The offense went three-and-out on their two full series vs. Green Bay's starters, gaining just 8 total yards. They couldn't run the ball (4 yards on three carries). The defense was OK at times, but they allowed a touchdown as Aaron Rodgers was, well, Aaron Rodgers.\n\nOne reason to be concerned: The inability to generate anything on the ground. The blocking has not been good -- it's not the same guy missing a block, either. These issues are spread around and includes the tight ends. The Redskins aren't generating much of a push or re-establishing the line of scrimmage. That must improve considering the Redskins say they want to emphasize the run more this season. But the run game must give them reason to believe it can be consistent.\n\nThat guy could start: Running back Samaje Perine. He looked much improved Saturday after a tough showing vs. Baltimore. And he still has work to do to be truly ready for a starting job. But Perine ran more decisive and with power -- he excels at yards after contact. Perine, who gained 45 yards on eight carries, also appeared to handle protection duties better, proving to be a quick study.\n\nRookie watch: Corner Fabian Moreau made his preseason debut with somewhat mixed results. He gave up a 38-yard catch, but give credit to quarterback Brett Hundley for a perfect throw. Moreau broke up another pass by playing physical and using good leverage. He also made two plays on special teams, causing a fumble on one.\n\nSummer debut: Receiver Josh Doctson caught one pass for 12 yards, working mostly with the second offense. He also broke up a would-be interception thanks to his leaping ability and athleticism. Doctson was open on a rub route at the goal line, but Cousins didn't pull the trigger. They need to work a lot more together so Cousins can develop a trust in him. Doctson did show good patience running his routes.\n\nDefensive duo: The Redskins started Mason Foster and Zach Brown inside; both had their moments with Foster doing a nice job handling play-calling duties and making plays. Brown showed his speed, but also allowed a touchdown pass on a fade to tight end Martellus Bennett from Rodgers. No crime there. But he'll also know he could have played it a little better and prevented Bennett from creating extra space by faking inside.", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:02:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3372615", "time": "04:02:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3372615", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "189313", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 4}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "310124", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Washington Redskins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins", "score": 4}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 4}, {"id": "312091", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "score": 2}, {"id": "314205", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "score": 3}, {"id": "322846", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "score": 2}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 4}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 2}, {"id": "325505", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brett Hundley"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Hundley", "score": 2}, {"id": "339018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "score": 4}, {"id": "351349", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kirk Cousins"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Cousins", "score": 3}, {"id": "351350", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jay Gruden"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Gruden", "score": 3}, {"id": "379307", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Terrelle Pryor"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrelle_Pryor", "score": 3}, {"id": "380861", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mason Foster"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason_Foster", "score": 1}, {"id": "410706", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Colt McCoy"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_McCoy", "score": 3}, {"id": "410708", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Vernon Davis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernon_Davis", "score": 3}, {"id": "411804", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wheel (route)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_(route)", "score": 3}, {"id": "507925", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chris Thompson (English musician)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Thompson_(English_musician)", "score": 3}, {"id": "1271477", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Samaje Perine"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaje_Perine", "score": 2}, {"id": "1286673", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nate Sudfeld"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Sudfeld", "score": 3}, {"id": "1296411", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Josh Doctson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Doctson", "score": 3}], "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0819%2Fr246346_2_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "04:02:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Redskins' offense, Kirk Cousins can't find a rhythm in loss to Packers", "originalArticle": null}

It came inside the two-minute warning of the first half and well after Green Bay's starting defense had retired for the evening.\n\nUntil that point, the Redskins offense hurt itself with penalties. Cousins underthrew tight end Vernon Davis in the end zone for what should have been a touchdown and was off on throws to others. Fourth-year wide receiver Ryan Grant, who continues to win Gruden's confidence with his reliability and work ethic in practice, caught a six-yard pass when seven yards was required and then retreated rather than fought for the first down. And the running game that had disappointed Gruden so at Baltimore, gaining just 2.2 yards per carry, regressed against the Packers. When the Redskins starters' work was done, with just under two minutes remaining in the second quarter, running backs Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson had combined for 10 yards on 11 carries.\n\nBackup quarterback Colt McCoy took over in the second half and turned a four-point deficit into a lead with touchdown to Niles Paul. But Green Bay prevailed before what remained of an announced crowd of 55,239.\n\nBut the story line that mattered most was written in the first half, which belonged to the Cousins-led offense. It was bleak, with missed throws that suggested Cousins and his largely remade corps of receivers need far more work together than the two remaining preseason games will permit.\n\nCousins, who is coming off consecutive seasons that saw him break the franchise record for passing yards, has yet to get the chance to throw to his favorite target, tight end Jordan Reed, who sat out training camp and both preseason games to date with an injured toe. He has thrown just once each to Pryor and Josh Doctson, the receivers that the Redskins are most counting on to replace the 2,000 yards lost with the departure of free agents DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon. Cousins was hit-and-miss against the Packers, completing just 14 of 23 throws for 144 yards. His best was a beauty of a deep ball that found Thompson in stride for a 29-yard gain. But by any measure, the passing game that carried the Redskins to last season's 8-7-1 finish is far from polished with just three weeks remaining before the Sept. 10 opener.\n\nThe running game is in trouble, too. The offensive line isn't blocking well, and no back is showing the violence with his carries that Gruden seeks.\n\nFurther back on the depth chart, where rookies are trying to distinguish themselves and second- and third-teams are vying for roster spots, there were some bright spots.\n\nRookie Fabian Moreau, who only recently started practicing with the team, made two big splashes on special-teams duty. Rookie running back Samaje Perine bounced back from his nervous preseason debut at Baltimore, hung onto the ball and flashed a bit of the physicality that distinguished his Oklahoma career. Tight end Niles Paul, fully healed after missing all of 2015 and half of last season with injuries, made his presence felt, recovering a muffed punt return and catching a go-ahead touchdown from Colt McCoy in the third quarter.\n\nDoctson, the team's first-round pick in the 2016 draft, made his long-awaited preseason debut, stepping on to the field for his first game since Achilles' injuries ended his rookie season in Week 3 last year. And Pryor, the 6-4 wide receiver whose length and athleticism had vexed Redskins defensive backs throughout training camp, caught his first pass of the preseason from Cousins.", "dateTime":

{"id": 232005338, "title": "Central Basin\u2019s auditor quits over missing records, ongoing \u2018mismanagement\u2019", "text": "An accounting firm hired to audit Central Basin Municipal Water District\u2019s fiscal records threw in the towel last week, claiming it could not finish the job because missing records and \u201congoing mismanagement\u201d had undermined the review\u2019s integrity. Central Basin hired the firm, Harshwal & Co., in November 2022 to complete a routine end-of-the-year audit of the district\u2019s finances for fiscal year 2021-22. Yet, a year-and-a-half later, the review is still incomplete and now may need to be started over, records showed. In a June 3 resignation letter, Managing Partner Sanwar Harshwal stated auditors \u201cencountered significant internal control deficiencies that demand immediate attention.\u201d \u201cWe have dedicated our efforts to rectify these deficiencies, but their persistence raises significant concerns regarding the reliability and accuracy of the financial information provided to us,\u201d Harshwal wrote. \u201cAdditionally, the challenges associated with incomplete and insufficient information have obstructed our ability to conduct a thorough and comprehensive audit.\u201d Central Basin is a water wholesaler that serves 1.6 million people from 24 cities and unincorporated areas in Southeast Los Angeles County, including La Habra Heights, East Los Angeles, Signal Hill and parts of Compton and Carson. It is years behind on the annual audits supposed to be completed within six months of a fiscal year\u2019s end. Lack of \u2018internal controls\u2019 Harshwal\u2019s audit for 2021-22 found \u201csignificant variances\u201d between the agency\u2019s internal closing balances and supporting documents, according to a draft provided to Central Basin in late May. \u201cThere was a lack of established internal controls and processes over the financial reporting process to ensure timely and accurate financial reporting,\u201d auditors wrote. Such a weakness generally increases the chance that \u201cfraud or material errors will occur,\u201d according to the draft. The auditors initially issued a \u201cqualified opinion,\u201d which indicates that problems exist but are not pervasive, in their May 16 draft. However, days later, an employee at Harshwal told Kenneth Pun, the contractor serving as Central Basin\u2019s finance director, the firm intended to lower its opinion or quit. Central Basin previously fired most of its staff, including its internal finance director, in 2020 and contracted out for those services in subsequent years. Harshwal\u2019s downgrade would have dropped the agency to the second worst audit opinion possible and put its financial credibility at risk. The lower rating \u2014 called a \u201cdisclaimer of opinion\u201d \u2014 essentially states that an auditor was unable to form an opinion because of the amount of missing information. Harshwal reportedly attempted to resign several times from February to May, but was repeatedly persuaded by staff to stay on. The deficiencies outlined by Harshwal are not new discoveries. A previous accounting firm hired to complete a fiscal 2020-21 audit noted the exact same problems during its review and Central Basin pledged to make reforms in response, records showed. That firm, Maze & Associates, turned in its audit in September 2022 and then terminated its contract with Central Basin a month later. Both Maze & Associates and Harshwall & Co. \u2014 hired as Maze\u2019s replacement \u2014 originally were given three-year contracts, but opted to resign early. Maze\u2019s finished audit notes it had to make \u201c$2.1 million in adjustments\u201d to the district\u2019s balance sheets. That covers roughly 10% of the district\u2019s overall budget. Resignation \u2018concerning\u2019 Central Basin\u2019s newly hired interim general manager \u2014 Elaine Jeng, who took the helm in late May \u2014 stated Harshwal\u2019s resignation is \u201cconcerning as it signifies a lack of confidence in the district\u2019s financial records.\u201d Though her knowledge of the district\u2019s operations is presently limited, resolving the issues highlighted by Harshwal is a \u201cpriority,\u201d she said. \u201cMoving forward, with the Board\u2019s support, the District\u2019s plan is to solicit the services of another financial auditing firm to complete the audit for FY 22, FY 23, and FY 24,\u201d Jeng said in an email. \u201cThe District will seek to improve the preparation of the back-up data to support the financial records. This may necessitate temporary staff augmentation and dedicating internal resources to this focus.\u201d Jeng will present a list of potential replacement firms to the agency\u2019s board of directors in the near future, she said. \u201cMy priority as IGM is to ensure that the District produces a report from a reputable firm that accurately reflects the financial status of the organization,\u201d she wrote. Pushback from finance team The Pun Group, the contractor acting as its finance department, internally pushed back against Harshwal\u2019s conclusions, according to an email obtained by the Southern California News Group. Pun told then-Acting General Manager Victor Ponto that his team strongly disagrees with Harshwal\u2019s statements about \u201cinadequacies in the accounting records.\u201d \u201cWe have invested considerable time and effort in correcting any misstatements and addressing all concerns raised by the audit team,\u201d Pun wrote in his email. \u201cThis development is both unprofessional and unacceptable, especially given the extensive efforts we have made to ensure the accuracy and integrity of our financial statements.\u201d Pun recommended scheduling an urgent meeting with the Board of Directors to discuss the next steps, including potentially \u201cseeking legal action\u201d against Harshwal. However, at this time, the board is not set to meet again until its regularly scheduled meeting at the end of June. \u201cIt is crucial that we address this matter promptly to maintain the integrity of our financial reporting and uphold the District\u2019s reputation,\u201d Pun wrote. Board \u2018totally negligent\u2019 Board Director Leticia Vasquez condemned the idea of suing Harshwal for \u201csimply doing their job.\u201d The issues identified in the audit and the resignation letter are consistent with the concerns she has expressed about the district\u2019s finances over the past three years, she said. \u201cFor the past three years, this is how this agency has been functioning,\u201d she said. \u201cThe board has been totally negligent in its responsibility to the agency and the public we serve.\u201d The reasons behind the resignation of Maze & Associates nearly two years ago were never discussed by the board, she said. Past troubles Vasquez supported motions to place General Manager Alex Rojas on paid administrative leave and to launch investigations into his management as a result of her concerns about the district\u2019s finances. Rojas was charged by the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office in August 2022 for allegedly accepting $400,000 in bribes while serving as the superintendent of the Bassett Unified School District. Despite the arrest, he continued to run the water district for nearly two years until the board placed him on leave following a shift in political power in early 2024. The board majority initially allowed Rojas, who is often credited with stabilizing the district following a particularly tumultuous period, to stay on because the criminal case was \u2014 and is \u2014 still pending and was considered unrelated to his new role. The turning point came after Vasquez, while suing the agency she represents over her alleged treatment by Rojas, uncovered a connection between Rojas\u2019 co-defendant in the bribery case and a contractor hired by Central Basin. Testimony revealed that Capstone Partners Group, a construction management firm hired by Central Basin, was owned by a longtime employee of Del Terra, a company involved in Rojas\u2019 case. Rojas has denied having any involvement in the selection of Capstone and maintains he did not know about any ties between Capstone and Luis Rojas, his co-defendant, until after Capstone ended its contract in August 2022. Much of Capstone\u2019s work with the district occurred during the fiscal year that was under review by Harshwal, according to board director Juan Garza. \u201cThe critical nature of this specific audit is that it reflects a time period in our agency when Capstone was performing services,\u201d Garza said. \u201cMoving forward, we need to figure out what exactly happened and we\u2019re committed to this under the new management team.\u201d A separate forensic audit and investigation into the district\u2019s hiring of Capstone is still pending. Garza said it is troubling that the district still does not have the full accounting for \u201cactivities and transactions that took place almost two years ago.\u201d He questioned why the district never implemented the reforms proposed in response to the 2020-21 findings of Maze & Associate. \u201cWe have two auditors of prestige quitting as soon as they finish their first year with us,\u201d Garza said. \u201cIt is highly disturbing and it is an independent message that the finances and controls in our agency are not accurate and that we have to find out the truth to restore our agency\u2019s credibility and, more importantly, our agency\u2019s control measures and operations.\u201d", "summary": "Harshwal &#38; Co., the second accounting firm to quit in two years, said it had \"significant concerns\" about the the accuracy of the financial data it was provided.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/06/09/central-basins-auditor-quits-over-missing-records-ongoing-mismanagement/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Central-Basin.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:05:19", "author": "Jason Henry", "authors": ["Jason Henry"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.459}

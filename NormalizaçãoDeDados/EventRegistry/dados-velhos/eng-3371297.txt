Like it or not he is not a parent under the law,\" said Wiesner.\n\nWiesner then told the judge that the estranged couple's divorce had descended into \"nastiness\" that Angel should not become a part of.\n\n\"If you allow it to be amended Mr Belafonte is going to file a paper that goes to the media involving Angel, that is a certainty and then all bets are off.\n\n\"You are opening Pandora's Box and this will become what it was not intended to be for Angel.\n\n\"This will become even more of a media circus for an innocent little girl and it needs to be rejected.\n\n\"Support is about money but this is about the heart and soul of a kid. she is entitled to privacy. She may be the last member of this family who has that and she is entitled to keep it.\n\n\"It is also about Mr Murphy's rights to privacy. If you allow that then you are going to be in protracted litigation about Angel.\"\n\nBelafonte's attorneys argued to Judge Lawrence Riff that they should be allowed to amend the court record in case Belafonte wants to apply for step-parent visitation rights over the youngster.\n\n\"We are here asking one, for a typographical error, and two, with respect to potentially requesting step-parent visitation rights,\" said lawyer Michael Hanasab.\n\nHanasab told the court that Mel's lawyers were not arguing Belafonte was not entitled to file for visitation rights but trying to prevent 'the potential minefield' that may result.\n\n\"It is not that he is not a colourful step-parent, they have not said he is not a step-parent or that he is not allowed to file for step-parent visitation. That is for another day,\" he said.\n\nHanasab told the court that Belafonte \"has been the parent that has raised this minor child since an infant\" and urged the judge to allow the amendment to his court papers.\n\nJudge Riff agreed with Belafonte's lawyers and allowed the amendment.\n\n\"The request is granted. Let me just observe that of paramount concern is the best interests of this minor, Angel,\" he told the court.\n\n\"Right now before the court are the contentions by the two litigants as to what is in that child's best interests.\n\n\"Mr Belafonte asserts and alleges that it is in that child's best interests for him to have frequent and continued contact with a child he is saying he raised from infancy.\n\n\"The petitioner says it is not in Angel's best interest for that to occur.\n\n\"Whether Mr Belafonte has the rights of a step-parent are not in front of the court today so I take no position on that.\"\n\nSusan Wiesner then warned about Murphy being pulled into the case.\n\n\"You are not just invading Angel's privacy you are also invading Eddie Murphy's privacy and he is not in the court room today,\" she said.\n\nMel has made a string of serious claims against Stephen, who is the father to her five-year-old daughter, Madison.\n\nThese include alleging she suffered repeated physical abuse during their ten-year marriage and alleging that their family nanny Lorraine Gilles, 26, had an abortion after he got her pregnant.\n\nIn court papers filed by her lawyers Mel, whose real name is Melanie Brown, claimed that Belafonte made her have sex with other women in a threesome that he videotaped.\n\nShe claimed that Belafonte held the videotapes over her head and threatened to destroy her career by leaking them and a Los Angeles judge banned Stephen from distributing sex tapes, photographs or any other sexually explicit material of her.\n\nMel later went back to court amid claims that Belafonte and Gilles have the tapes locked up in a storage unit, which she won access to.\n\nMel's claims against Belafonte begin in November 2007, just months after the couple married in Las Vegas in June.\n\nMel, whose real name is Melanie Brown, claimed that Belafonte put his hands around her neck and choked her.\n\nIn court papers, Mel even claims she tried to commit suicide by swallowing a little of aspirin but was prevented from calling an ambulance by Stephen.\n\nShe claims that when he discovered her in the bathroom he told her: \"Die b**ch.\"\n\nAnd Mel claimed that when she tried to get away from Belafonte he continued 'to slam the door on my head.'\n\nMel states in the papers that her injuries were discovered when she arrived to work on the ' X Factor ' the following day, after which she spent two days getting hospital treatment.\n\nStephen has denied all of the allegations Mel has made against him.\n\nHe, in turn, has filed court papers demanding that Mel pay for all of his legal fees in their divorce case and pay him spousal support.\n\nMel had asked the court to deny Belafonte financial support and has demanded sole custody of their child, while Stephen had asked for joint custody.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 100, "id": 180, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family"}, {"uri":

That sounds messy.\n\nThe Spice Girls singer filed for divorce from Stephen, a director, in March after their split.\n\nThe pair, who were married for 10-years both, raised Angel who was born two months before their wedding day.\n\nThis latest twist to their messy split has caused Mel's lawyer, Susan Weisner to plead for Angel's involvement to be kept private to prevent the case further descending into a media 'circus.'\n\nCommenting on the situation on Thursday, she said: 'We have got another parent here, we have got Eddie Murphy. If the court's going to give him notice of proceedings and embroiling him in litigation, then we are putting his little girl in the middle of this media firestorm.'\n\nShe also asked that Angel would remain 'the last one in this family that can have protection and privacy.'\n\nStephen's lawyer Michael Hanasa pointed out that his client has raised the young girl from a young age and that she already lacks privacy due to being 'paraded around' on gossip sites like TMZ.\n\nThe authorities granted the film producer's request to submit papers granting visitation in the future.\n\nThe Los Angeles Superior Court's Judge Lawrence Riff said: 'The request is granted. Let me just observe that of paramount concern is the best interests of this minor, Angel.

The petitioner says it is not in Angel's best interest for that to occur.\n\n'Whether Mr Belafonte has the rights of a stepparent are not in front of the court today so I take no position on that.'\n\nThe judge also added: \"Mr Murphy is entitled to be joined as a party as soon as Mr Belafonte seeks any visitation with Angel'\n\nDuring Mel and Stephen's divorce proceedings, the America's Got Talent judge has accused the film producer of being mentally and physical and abusive.\n\nMetro.co.uk has contacted representatives of Eddie Murphy for a comment.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 100, "id": 181, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 211, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "wgt": 100, "id": 426, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children,_Youth_and_Family", "wgt": 100, "id": 739, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Children, Youth and Family"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "type": "loc", "id": "228323"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302685", "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302767", "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_Message_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303499", "label": {"eng": "Short Message Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304353", "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "304979", "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306307", "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309436", "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_to_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313316", "label": {"eng": "Coming to America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "319806", "label": {"eng": "Melanie Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Girls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328780", "label": {"eng": "Spice Girls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "347173", "label": {"eng": "Little Mix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google ", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357814", "label": {"eng": "Google+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "363938", "label": {"eng": "Eddie Murphy"}}]}

reports in the US, Scary Spice is now dating a Beverly Hills police officer.\n\nThe 42-year-old mum-of-three has been secretly dating the cop for the last few months, following her bitter separation from husband Stephen Belafonte in April.\n\nSpeaking to a friend, her film producer ex said: \"I'm glad the relationship is over and that Mel has moved on is getting on with her life but I hope she's not bringing him around the children.\"\n\nA source close to the film producer said Belafonte, 42, feels it may be too soon for the couple's kids to see either parent in a new relationship.\n\n\"Divorce papers were only filed in March and the court still has to decide on final custody arrangements,\" the source told the Mirror.\n\n\"It's confusing to the children and not healthy for the children to be exposed to either parent's new relationships while they are still adjusting to the divorce.\"\n\nThe former couple has one daughter together, Madison Brown Belafonte, five, and Belafonte raised step-daughter Angel, 10, as his own.\n\nSince the split Mel has refused her ex to allow him to contact Angel despite court papers stating he was the only father she has known since birth.\n\nAngel was born after Leeds-born Mel had a brief relationship with actor Eddie Murphy, who ironically became famous in the movie, Beverley Hills Cop.\n\nLawyers for the former couple are due at a hearing on Thursday to discuss custody of the children, Belafonte's request for visitation with Angel and when their divorce will be heard.\n\nMel has accused her ex of being abusive during their 10-year marriage while claiming he has video taped her having threesomes.\n\nBelafonte, who has been running his restaurant on Sunset Strip in LA, has denied the allegation refusing to speak out saying his \"number one priority will always be his kids\".\n\nWhen the Mirror contacted Belafonte a spokesman declined to comment.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

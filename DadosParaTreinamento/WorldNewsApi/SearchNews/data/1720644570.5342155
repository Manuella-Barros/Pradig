Villeneuve, who won the F1 championship driving for Williams in 1997, is working for Sky Sports ahead of this Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal and left his colleagues stunned with a savage takedown of Ricciardo. The Australian driver and fan favourite made a return to F1 midway through last season with Red Bull's junior team, now named Visa Cash App RB. Ricciardo, 34, had ambitions of replacing Sergio Perez in the second Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen, but his form in the first third of this season gave him little chance and Perez has since signed a new two-year contract. Already 14 points behind RB team-mate Yuki Tsunoda, Ricciardo's future beyond 2024 has come into question, with reserve driver Liam Lawson waiting in the wings. If the decision was down Villeneuve, there'd be no debate. \"Why's he still in F1? Why?\" the Canadian savagely asked. \"We've been hearing the same thing now for the last four or five years. 'We have to make the car better, poor him'. Sorry, it's been five years of that. No, you are in F1. Maybe you make that effort for Lewis Hamilton who has won multiple championships. You don't make that effort for a driver that can't cut it. \"If you can't cut it, go home, there's someone else to take your place. That's how it's always been in racing, it's the pinnacle of the sport. There's no reason to keep going and to keep finding excuses. You all talk about that first season or first two seasons. \"He was beating a [Sebastian] Vettel that was burnt out, that was trying to invent things with the car to go win and just making a mess of his weekends. Then he was beating for half a season Verstappen when Verstappen was 18 years old, just starting. Then that was it, he stopped beating anyone after that.\" Your turn! Do you agree with Jacques Villeneuve? Join the debate in the comments section As pundits Karun Chandhok and Danica Patrick took stock of his comments, presenter Rachel Brookes then asked Villeneuve if Ricciardo has been 'overrated' in his career, to which he responded: \"I think his image has kept him in F1 more than his actual results.\" Just two days ago, the 34-year-old claimed that he still has eyes on replacing Perez, who's now contracted to Red Bull until the end of 2026 in a show of faith from team principal Christian Horner. \"It doesn't surprise me and it doesn't change anything for me,\" Ricciardo said of Red Bull's hotly-debated decision. \"Obviously, my goal\u2026 at some point I'd love to be back there. But I also know that my season hasn't been spectacular. I had a spectacular moment in Miami but otherwise I\u2019ve been a bit up and down and I\u2019ve been doing this long enough and I know myself that I want to be doing better. \"Already after the first few races I was just focused on trying to do the most I can here. Through that, then I'll have the most control over my future. Up until now I probably haven't been awesome enough but, equally, I am happy being here just being back in the Red Bull family. We'll keep charging forward. \"I don't think [Perez's renewal] means that now it will never happen. We'll see. If I'm [still] here next year, then I'll be happy.\"", "summary": "Daniel Ricciardo has endured a difficult start to the Formula 1 season, prompting to Jacques Villeneuve - who won the world championship in 1997 - to savage his career", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/formula-1/jacques-villeneuve-daniel-ricciardo-f1-32988048", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988191.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jacques-Villeneuve-and-Daniel-Ricciardo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:42:12", "author": "Nathan Ridley,Nathan-Ridley", "authors": ["Nathan Ridley", "Nathan-Ridley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.107}

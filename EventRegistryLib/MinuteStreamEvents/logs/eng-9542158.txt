The Company is finalizing the terms of debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\n\nSteward took this voluntary step today as a necessary measure to allow the Company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption. Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process. Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chief Executive Officer of Steward. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained. By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe other primary factor driving this voluntary Chapter 11 case is, in large part, due to Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system.\n\nIf you have questions about this announcement, you may call the information line created by the Company (888) 505-1257 (toll free) or (646) 893-5546 (international).

Steward's eight hospitals in Massachusetts including St. Elizabeth's Hospital and Carney Hospital, both in Boston. It filed for protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nSteward's troubles in Massachusetts have drawn the ire of top political figures including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, who have said the company's previous private equity owners \"sold (Steward) for parts\" and \"walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars.\"\n\nMassachusetts Gov. Maura Healey said Monday that the state had been preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing and has established a call center for anyone with questions. She said despite the filing, Steward hospitals will remain open and patients should continue to keep their appointments.\n\nHealey was particularly critical of Steward's management of the hospitals, which she said led to the crisis.\n\n\"This situation stems from and is rooted in greed, mismanagement and lack of transparency on the part of Steward leadership in Dallas, Texas,\" Healey said at a Monday press conference. \"It's a situation that should never have happened and we'll be working together to take steps to make sure this never happens again.\"\n\nSteward said it is finalizing the terms of \"debtor-in-possession financing\" from its landlord Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and \"up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.\"\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment.

patients and our communities.\"\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell said Monday that the bankruptcy doesn't allow Steward to \"immediately shut its doors and leave town.\" She said her office will advocate on behalf of patients and workers throughout the bankruptcy proceedings.\n\n\"I also want to make it crystal clear that I take very seriously any effort for this hospital system to make a profit to the detriment of patients, to strip-mine hospitals for their value,\" Campbell said.\n\nIn March, the company announced it had struck a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, as it works to stabilize its finances.\n\nThe move came as Healey said state monitors were keeping an eye on the health care facilities operated by Steward Health Care in Massachusetts, including hospitals in some of the state's poorer communities.\n\nMassachusetts Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka, said Monday that her \"immediate concern remains the quality and continuity of care for the thousands of patients within the Steward system.\"\n\nDemocratic House Speaker Ronald Mariano said the House will take up comprehensive legislation next week to address gaps in the state's regulatory process exploited by Steward.", "source": {"uri": "commercialrecord.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Commercial Record"}, "authors":

The Company is finalizing the terms of debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\n\nSteward took this voluntary step today as a necessary measure to allow the Company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption. Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process. Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chief Executive Officer of Steward. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained. By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe other primary factor driving this voluntary Chapter 11 case is, in large part, due to Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system.\n\nIf you have questions about this announcement, you may call the information line created by the Company (888) 505-1257 (toll free) or (646) 893-5546 (international).

Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chief Executive Officer of Steward. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained. By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe other primary factor driving this voluntary Chapter 11 case is, in large part, due to Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system.\n\nIf you have questions about this announcement, you may call the information line created by the Company (888) 505-1257 (toll free) or (646) 893-5546 (international).

At Steward Medical Group, the company's employed physician group, physicians provide more than six million patient encounters per year.\n\nThere are over 7,900 beds under Steward's management, according to the website.\n\nWhat will happen to Steward's hospitals during Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings?\n\nBy filing for bankruptcy, the Dallas-based company will become eligible for debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust, the company that owns the buildings Steward operates in. According to the statement, Steward could receive initial funding of $75 million and up to $225 million from the company.\n\n\"Steward took this voluntary step today as a necessary measure to allow the company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption,\" the statement says.\n\n\"With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained,\" Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Steward's chief executive officer, said.\n\nDespite Steward's claims that its hospitals will stay open, the company already closed down New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton in April of this year.", "source": {"uri": "eu.enterprisenews.com",

In a press release, company officials said Steward took the step as a necessary measure to allow the company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients. \"Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process,\" the company said in a written statement. \"Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.\" The Dallas-based company operates more than 30 hospitals nationwide, including Massachusetts facilities: St. Elizabeth's in Brighton, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holy Family Hospital in Methuen and Haverhill Hospital in Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Norwood Hospital, and St. Anne's in Fall River. The filed for protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Steward's troubles in Massachusetts have drawn the ire of top political figures including U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey, who have said the company's previous private equity owners \"sold (Steward) for parts\" and \"walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars.\" Steward said it is finalizing the terms of \"debtor-in-possession financing\" from its landlord Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and \"up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions.\" \"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" Dr. Ralph de la Torre, CEO of Steward said in a press release. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations,\" he added. He also pointed to what he described as insufficient reimbursement by government payers as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates at a time of skyrocketing costs. Torre said that by seeking bankruptcy protections, Steward will be better positioned to \"responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\" In March, the company announced it had struck a deal to sell its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, as it works to stabilize its finances. The move came as Gov. Maura Healey said state monitors were keeping an eye on the health care facilities operated by Steward Health Care in Massachusetts, including hospitals in some of the state's poorer communities. Massachusetts Democratic Senate President Karen Spilka, said Monday that her \"immediate concern remains the quality and continuity of care for the thousands of patients within the Steward system.\"",

They are as follows:\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging healthcare environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals,\" de la Torre said. \"Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nNorwood Hospital in Norwood remains temporarily closed after flooding. Steward Health Care permanently closed New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton last month.\n\nIn late January, Steward said the hospital's financial performance had decreased by 1,600 percent over the last five years. The healthcare company blamed \"skyrocketing expenses\" related to labor, material costs due to inflation, and lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on its decision to close the hospital. Steward also said that it owed about $50 million in unpaid rent.\n\n\"With the delay in closing the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained,\" de la Torre added. \"By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts.\"\n\nMassachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh said Gov. Maura Healey had been preparing for the bankruptcy announcement.\n\n\"Today, Steward Health Care moved forward with a bankruptcy filing under federal law - an action for which the Healey-Driscoll administration has been preparing. Steward hospitals remain open, and patients should not hesitate to seek care. The Healey-Driscoll administration is working with Steward and any potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs, and stabilizes our health care system,\" Walsh said.\n\nThe Massachusetts Nurses Association said the potential loss of any of these facilities will have devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of residents from the South Shore to southern New Hampshire.\n\n\"The administration, the legislature, the healthcare industry, and all those who value the health of our communities should immediately take whatever steps are needed to ensure the preservation of these facilities and the safe transition to more stable and responsible not-for-profit ownership. Inaction would worsen health inequities, create hospital deserts, and weaken the entire healthcare infrastructure for all patients in Massachusetts,\" an MNA spokesperson said.\n\nLast week, Walsh announced that a Boston doctor will lead the state's emergency operations plan to ensure clinical quality and healthcare access in eastern Massachusetts amid Steward's challenges.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

It said it does not expect day-to-day operations to be interrupted, with hospitals, doctor's offices and other facilities open.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees and communities at this time,\" Ralph de la Torre, chief executive officer of Steward, said in a prepared statement.\n\nSteward operates the following hospitals:\n\nSteward in 2021 acquired the Miami-Dade and Broward hospitals from Tenet Healthcare Corp. It also has hospitals in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nMORE BANKRUPTCY HEADLINES:\n\nMonday's news release said Steward was finalizing an initial $75 million in what is known as debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust, Inc. Debtor-in possession financing is a type of funding for companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSteward also said it could receive up to an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\" Steward and Medical Properties Trust have reached deals in the past.\n\nFor example, Medical Properties Trust said in a 2021 news release that it had reached agreement to purchase the five South Florida hospitals from Tenet in conjunction with Steward's acquisition of the operation of the hospitals. The news release said Medical Properties Trust would lease the facilities to Steward.\n\nSteward has taken other steps to deal with its financial issues, such as planning to sell its Stewardship Health physician group to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, according to numerous news reports. But de la Torre's statement Monday indicated the Optum deal had been delayed.\n\n\"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals,\" the statement said. \"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained.\"\n\nSteward's financial problems have drawn heavy attention in Massachusetts, where it operates nine hospitals. In a Feb. 20, letter Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey accused Steward of refusing to submit financial records to the state.\n\nMedia reports said Healey later called for Steward to leave the state, and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., blasted the company in a March 7 letter to de la Torre.\n\n\"Steward's Massachusetts hospitals are in deep financial distress and appear to be in danger of closure because of years of mismanagement, private equity schemes, and executive profiteering,\" the letter said.\n\nIn Monday's news release about the bankruptcy filing, Steward pointed to factors such as \"continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system,\" the news release said.\n\nAmong Steward's top executives is Ruben King-Shaw Jr., a former secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration who serves as the company's chief strategy officer, according to the company's website.", "source": {"uri": "fox35orlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX

Maura Healey's administration had been preparing for the company to file for bankruptcy in a brief statement posted to X, formerly Twitter, Monday morning. Walsh noted that Steward hospitals remain open and patients \"should not hesitate to seek care.\"\n\nThe administration is \"working with Steward and other potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs and stabilizes our health care system,\" Walsh said.\n\nSteward owns eight hospitals in Massachusetts.\n\nThe company has been the subject of intense scrutiny from state and federal officials in Massachusetts as more information came to light about its precarious financial position, which includes tens of millions of dollars in debt, MassLive reported. On Friday, the state activated an \"emergency operations plan\" to ensure patients had continued access to the hospital system.\n\nSteward is finalizing the terms of a $75 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement with Medical Properties Trust, its de-facto landlord, that could provide the company an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\" Debtor-in-possession financing is only available to companies in bankruptcy, and serves as a lifeline for companies in financial distress, according to Corporate Finance Institute.\n\nFiling for bankruptcy was a \"necessary measure to allow the company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption,\" Steward said in a statement posted to its website Monday morning.\n\nRalph de la Torre, the company's chief executive officer, said Steward has done \"everything in its power\" to operate successfully in what he dubbed a \"highly challenging health care environment.\" Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy is \"in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" he said.\n\nIn March, Steward announced that it planned to sell its network of doctors to a wing of the for-profit UnitedHealth Group for an undisclosed sum, WBUR reported at the time.\n\nAnd in April, the company followed through on its planned shuttering of New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, a move that resulted in the loss of 39 rehabilitation service beds, 119 chronic care beds, and all ambulatory care at the hospital, according to a filing the struggling health care company made with state regulators in January.\n\nThe court-supervised bankruptcy process will leave Steward \"better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nCompany officials also blamed the filing on Steward receiving insufficient reimbursements from government payors like Medicare and Medicaid while it faced \"skyrocketing\" labor costs, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased material and operational costs from inflation.\n\n\"It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system,\" the statement reads.\n\nSteward announced in February that it had secured an additional $150 million in bridge financing, on top of a $600 million loan it received in the summer of 2023, according to Business Wire.

The hospital is set to receive initial funding of $75 million, and up to $225 million in additional funding if certain conditions are met. The landlord, specializing in health care facilities, initially provided Steward with a $60 million bridge loan in January.\n\nMedical Properties stock fell 10% during Monday morning trading following the bankruptcy news. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSteward Health CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre said on Monday that a delay in the sale of the company's physician group, Stewardship Health, to Optum was one reason it was forced to file for bankruptcy.\n\n\"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations, De la Torre, said. \"With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained.\"\n\nHe also cited insufficient reimbursement of Medicare and Medicaid, as well as \"continued impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic\" as additional reasons for the filing.",

Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" said Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chief Executive Officer of Steward. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained. By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe other primary factor driving this voluntary Chapter 11 case is, in large part, due to Steward continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company said. It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system.\n\nIf you have questions about this announcement, you may call the information line created by the Company (888) 505-1257 (toll free) or (646) 893-5546 (international).

It submitted the filing in the Southern District of Texas.\n\nThe Dallas-based company currently owns 30 hospitals across eight states, including nine in Massachusetts, where its smoldering financial crisis has raised concerns about patient safety.\n\nSteward has been one focus of a year-and-a-half-long CBS News investigation revealing how private equity investors have siphoned hundreds of millions of dollars from community hospitals with devastating public health consequences. Records reviewed by CBS News showed Steward hospitals around the country with a trail of unpaid bills, at times risking a shortage of potentially lifesaving supplies.\n\nLast year, CBS News found Steward redirected money away from hospital operations by selling off the real estate of San Antonio's Texas Vista Medical Center before closing the facility altogether.\n\nThe company's bankruptcy filing lists 30 creditors who are owed a total of more than $500 million, including the U.S. government, which is owed more than $32 million to the federal government in reimbursements for insurance overpayments.\n\nExperts tell CBS News that Steward's debts are likely much higher, and when the dust settles, it could be one of the largest hospital bankruptcies in U.S. history. In a statement, the company said it is relying on its landlord, Medical Properties Trust, to provide sufficient funding to allow its hospitals to continue to operate through bankruptcy.\n\n\"The Company is finalizing the terms of debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust,\" Steward said in a statement.\n\nThe company said declaring bankruptcy allows it to \"continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption.\"\n\nBoth Steward and Massachusetts officials said they expected no interruptions in day-to-day operations.\n\n\"Steward hospitals remain open, and patients should not hesitate to seek care,\" said Massachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh in a statement, adding that the state \"is working with Steward and any potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs and stabilizes our health care system.\"\n\nDespite those assurances, anxiety over the future viability of the company's hospitals runs deep, particularly in Massachusetts. For months, health care workers have voiced concern over the impact of any potential closure.\n\n\"The potential loss of any of these facilities will have devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of residents from the South Shore to southern New Hampshire,\" the Massachusetts Nurses Association said in a statement. \"However, Steward going through the process of reorganization provides an opportunity for other stakeholders to take long-awaited action and center the voices of caregivers and patients,\" the statement said in part.\n\nA spokesperson for Steward previously told CBS News company executives always put patients first and said they \"deny that any other considerations were placed ahead of that guiding principle.\" The spokesperson said Steward \"has actively and meaningfully invested\" in its hospital system since its formation, including in Massachusetts, where it took over hospitals that were \"failing\" and \"about to close.\"\n\n\"Steward's investment has taken the form of facility upgrades, equipment, technology, and other meaningful improvements,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nYet Steward has become synonymous with the perils of private equity investment in health care. The company started buying up Massachusetts hospitals in 2010, with hundreds of millions of dollars in backing from private equity giant Cerberus,\n\nCerberus shed its stake in Steward by January 2021, after making an $800 million profit in a decade, according to a report from Bloomberg. Financial records show Steward has also sold off more than $1 billion of its hospitals' land and buildings since 2016 to Medical Properties Trust, which has made a business of buying up hospital real estate from private equity investors.\n\nA filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2021 shows Steward's owners also paid themselves millions in dividends. Around the same time, Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre acquired a 190-foot yacht estimated to be worth $40 million. In an email to CBS News, Steward confirmed de la Torre owned the yacht.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" de la Torre said in the company's statement, released at 3:30 a.m. Monday morning. \"Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org",

The filing marks the largest provider bankruptcy in decades, according to Laura Coordes, professor of law at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.\n\nRegulators and experts have been anticipating the filing since April 30, when the for-profit chain missed its deadline to pay back at least a portion of its $750 million debt to half a dozen lenders. The private lenders, it appears, declined to extend Steward further credit.\n\nThe operator said its is working to finalize terms of debtor-in-possession financing from its landlord, Medical Properties Trust, for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million in funding upon the satisfaction of additional terms, according to a Monday press release.\n\nRegulators react\n\nIn Massachusetts, where Steward operates eight hospitals, lawmakers have been preparing for this day for months.\n\nRegulators escalated their efforts to receive financial information from distressed Steward beginning this winter. They first sent letters requesting information about the system's financial health and a plan for action. Then they invited Steward to public hearings to brief the community about the brewing crisis -- Steward officials were a no-show.\n\nFinally, officials hunkered down late last month for closed-door contingency planning sessions to consider how a possible Steward bankruptcy might impact Massachusetts' health system writ large.\n\nAmong those present during April 24's strategy session were David Seltz, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, which oversees the finances of hospitals in the state; Kate Walsh, secretary of Massachusetts' Health and Human Services; and Robbie Goldstein, commissioner of the state's Department of Public Health.\n\nWalsh described the meetings to the Boston Globe as going \"to bankruptcy school\" to map out all the possible outcomes that could come with a filing. Walsh stressed that hospitals would not necessarily close when Steward declared bankruptcy and entered restructuring -- at least in the short term -- based on her conversations with experts.\n\nHowever, Seltz is concerned the state's Southeastern region can't withstand any disruption to care given the region is already rated by state officials as \"high risk for or active constraints on hospital capacity,\" according to testimony from Seltz on April 24.\n\nCapacity constraints could significantly worsen with healthcare service disruptions resulting from a Steward bankruptcy, warned Seltz. He added southeastern Massachusetts residents are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in care because they have lower-than-average incomes and \"substantial\" care access challenges.\n\n\"These compounding challenges signal the need for collaborative action to ensure the stability of the health care landscape in Southeastern Massachusetts,\" Seltz said in a statement accompanying his testimony.\n\nSteward said it does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process.\n\nMonday morning, the Massachusetts HHS released a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying the state had been preparing for this outcome and had plans in place to preserve care access,\n\n\"Steward hospitals remain open, and patients should not hesitate to seek care. The Healey-Driscoll administration is working with Steward and any potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs and stabilizes our health care system,\" the HHS said.\n\nSteward's failed turnaround plan\n\nAlthough Steward put forth a plan to return to financial good standing in February, experts were dubious about whether the health system could execute a turnaround in such short order -- especially given the plan was dependent on asset sales.\n\nSteward said it would sell its physician group, Stewardship Health, and re-tenant some of its hospital portfolio to free up liquidity to pay down debts.\n\nHowever, as of April 24, the HPC said it had not begun its formal review of the deal, noting it was yet to receive all of the documents required to do so.\n\nIn a statement Monday about the bankruptcy, CEO Ralph de la Torre said the delayed sale contributed to the bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" said de la Torre. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations.\"\n\nThe CEO also said external factors contributed to the company's financial woes, citing insufficient reimbursement from government payers, high labor costs, inflationary pressures and lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhy didn't analysts predict Steward's collapse?\n\nSteward has earned a reputation for being secretive about its finances. In February, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey accused Steward of acting like a black box to obscure regulatory efforts and hide its financial condition.\n\nThe health system has spent years immersed in a legal battle with Massachusetts regulators over submitting routine financial data for auditing, citing the need to protect confidential business information.\n\nThe company has also failed to provide its own landlord with audited year-end financials, according to MPT's 2023 annual report. MPT was required to disclose Steward's 2022 audited financials to the Securities and Exchange Commission because Steward accounted for more than 20% of MPT's assets that year.\n\nThe watchdog agency requested Steward's financial information from MPT over 200 days ago in July, and has since sent two follow-up letters, according to MPT's annual report. Steward has maintained the documents are unavailable.\n\nWith limited data, analysts told Healthcare Dive that it became very difficult to see the full scope of Steward's struggles. Even Stuart Altman, who chaired the Massachusetts regulatory agency charged with overseeing hospital spending between 2012 and 2022, said his board missed the full scope of Steward's problems.\n\n\"I wish I could help you,\" he said. \"We at the Health Policy Commission did not hear in any way that they were in trouble. It just didn't come up until fairly recently.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

It said it does not expect day-to-day operations to be interrupted, with hospitals, doctor's offices and other facilities open.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees and communities at this time,\" Ralph de la Torre, chief executive officer of Steward, said in a prepared statement.\n\nSteward operates Coral Gables Hospital, Hialeah Hospital, North Shore Medical Center and Palmetto General Hospital in Miami-Dade County; Florida Medical Center in Broward County; Melbourne Regional Medical Center and Rockledge Regional Medical Center in Brevard County; and Sebastian River Medical Center in Indian River County.\n\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it's FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos]\n\nSteward in 2021 acquired the Miami-Dade and Broward hospitals from Tenet Healthcare Corp. It also has hospitals in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nMonday's news release said Steward was finalizing an initial $75 million in what is known as debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust, Inc. Debtor-in-possession financing is a type of funding for companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSteward also said it could receive up to an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\" Steward and Medical Properties Trust have reached deals in the past.\n\nFor example, Medical Properties Trust said in a 2021 news release that it had reached an agreement to purchase the five South Florida hospitals from Tenet in conjunction with Steward's acquisition of the operation of the hospitals. The news release said Medical Properties Trust would lease the facilities to Steward.\n\nSteward has taken other steps to deal with its financial issues, such as planning to sell its Stewardship Health physician group to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, according to numerous news reports. But de la Torre's statement Monday indicated the Optum deal had been delayed.\n\n\"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals,\" the statement said. \"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained.\"\n\nSteward's financial problems have drawn heavy attention in Massachusetts, where it operates nine hospitals. In a Feb. 20, letter Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey accused Steward of refusing to submit financial records to the state.\n\nMedia reports said Healey later called for Steward to leave the state, and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., blasted the company in a March 7 letter to de la Torre.\n\n\"Steward's Massachusetts hospitals are in deep financial distress and appear to be in danger of closure because of years of mismanagement, private equity schemes, and executive profiteering,\" the letter said.\n\nIn Monday's news release about the bankruptcy filing, Steward pointed to factors such as \"continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system,\" the news release said.\n\nAmong Steward's top executives is Ruben King-Shaw Jr., a former secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration who serves as the company's chief strategy officer, according to the company's website.\n\nGet today's headlines in minutes with Your Florida Daily:", "source":

There will not be any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process, the company noted. Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients.\n\nOn the NYSE, Medical Properties Trust shares were trading at $4.39, down 9.86%.\n\nFor

The company also said its hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" Dr. Ralph de la Torre, Chief Executive Officer of Steward, said in a statement. \"Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time.\"\n\nMassachusetts Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh said this move was expected by the Healey administration.\n\n\"Today, Steward Health Care moved forward with a bankruptcy filing under federal law - an action for which the Healey-Driscoll administration has been preparing,\" she said in a statement. \"Steward hospitals remain open, and patients should not hesitate to seek care.\"\n\nWalsh said the Healey administration \"is working with Steward and any potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs and stabilizes our health care system.\"\n\nSteward operates St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holy Family Hospital in Methuen, Haverhill Hospital in Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Norwood Hospital, and St. Anne's Hospital in Fall River.\n\nSteward has been struggling financially, prompting concern among state leaders and others in the health care industry for more than a month.\n\nOn Monday, the Massachusetts Nurses Association said the potential loss of any of Steward's hospitals \"will have devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of residents from the South Shore to southern New Hampshire.\"\n\n\"However, Steward going through the process of reorganization provides an opportunity for other stakeholders to take long-awaited action and center the voices of caregivers and patients,\" the nurses association said.\n\nIn its statement, Steward pointed to insufficient reimbursement from Medicare and Medicaid and increased costs of labor and medical supplies as contributing factors to the decision to file for bankruptcy.\n\nWhile Steward's announcement rippled across the region, Massachusetts Association of Health Plans President and CEO Lora Pellegrini said the association and its member plans \"understand the uncertainty raised by Steward Health Care's action today to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\"\n\n\"However, this filing does not mean that the system's hospitals, medical centers, or physician groups will close; patients can continue to receive care at all Steward facilities,\" Pellegrini said. \"MAHP member plans will continue to provide coverage at Steward facilities.\"\n\nPellegrini urged anyone with immediate concerns about insurance coverage or access to contact their health plan's member services department for help.\n\nHouse speaker says legislators plan to address regulatory gaps\n\nReacting Monday morning, state House Speaker Ronald Mariano said he has \"the utmost confidence in Secretary Kate Walsh and the Healey Administration's preparedness for this scenario, and in their commitment to preserving access to care.\"\n\n\"I also have every belief in the ability of our hospital leaders to support the state's response, and in the health care providers who will continue to care for each and every patient that arrives at a Steward hospital in the months to come, regardless of what may be happening at a Texas bankruptcy court,\" Mariano said.\n\nMariano said \"It is the Legislature's responsibility to ensure that what happened with Steward Health Care never happens again.\"\n\nHe continued, saying the state House of Representatives will soon take up \"comprehensive legislation to address gaps in our regulatory process that Steward exploited.\" Marino said legislation will also seek to stabilize the health care system and address rising health care costs.\n\nState leaders speak after Steward bankruptcy filing\n\nGov. Maura Healey and other state leaders addressed the Steward bankruptcy in a press conference Monday morning, repeatedly telling Massachusetts residents that Steward hospitals remain open despite the bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"Patients should keep your appointments,\" Healey said. \"Continue to seek care when you need it at these facilities.\"\n\nHealey said state Department of Public Health personnel remain on site at Steward hospitals \"to ensure that they are providing the highest standard of care that all Massachusetts patients are entitled to.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, this is a step toward our goal of getting Steward out of Massachusetts,\" Healey said.\n\nHealey continued, saying officials will work to \"ensure that there are steps taken to make sure that this does not happen again.\"\n\nWhile speaking Monday morning, officials said they were prepared for Steward's filing. In the hours, days and weeks ahead, officials said they will advocate Massachusetts interests in bankruptcy proceedings.\n\nWalsh also announced resources for patients at local Steward hospitals, including a forthcoming hotline and a website already available online.\n\nThough she said Steward's operations may \"wind down in time,\" state Attorney General Andrea Campbell said any changes in the company's footprint in Massachusetts will still be subject to state law.\n\nThis is a developing story; stay with 7NEWS on-air and online for the latest updates.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

The Company is finalizing the terms of debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\n\nAccording to Steward officials, the company took this voluntary step as a necessary measure to continue providing necessary care to patients in Port Arthur and across the network without disruption.\n\n\"Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process,\" a company release stated. \"Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.\"\n\nDr. Ralph de la Torre, chief executive officer, said Steward Health Care continues doing everything in its power to operate successfully \"in a highly challenging health care environment,\" adding that filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of patients, physicians, employees and,.\n\n\"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals,\" de la Torre said.\n\n\"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations.

It said it does not expect day-to-day operations to be interrupted, with hospitals, doctor's offices and other facilities open.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees and communities at this time,\" Ralph de la Torre, chief executive officer of Steward, said in a prepared statement.\n\nSteward operates Coral Gables Hospital, Hialeah Hospital, North Shore Medical Center and Palmetto General Hospital in Miami-Dade County; Florida Medical Center in Broward County; Melbourne Regional Medical Center and Rockledge Regional Medical Center in Brevard County; and Sebastian River Medical Center in Indian River County.\n\nSteward in 2021 acquired the Miami-Dade and Broward hospitals from Tenet Healthcare Corp. It also has hospitals in Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nMonday's news release said Steward was finalizing an initial $75 million in what is known as debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust, Inc. Debtor-in possession financing is a type of funding for companies in Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSteward also said it could receive up to an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\" Steward and Medical Properties Trust have reached deals in the past.\n\nFor example, Medical Properties Trust said in a 2021 news release that it had reached agreement to purchase the five South Florida hospitals from Tenet in conjunction with Steward's acquisition of the operation of the hospitals. The news release said Medical Properties Trust would lease the facilities to Steward.\n\nSteward has taken other steps to deal with its financial issues, such as planning to sell its Stewardship Health physician group to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealthcare, according to numerous news reports. But de la Torre's statement Monday indicated the Optum deal had been delayed.\n\n\"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals,\" the statement said. \"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations. With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained.\"\n\nSteward's financial problems have drawn heavy attention in Massachusetts, where it operates nine hospitals. In a Feb. 20, letter Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey accused Steward of refusing to submit financial records to the state.\n\nMedia reports said Healey later called for Steward to leave the state, and U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., blasted the company in a March 7 letter to de la Torre.\n\n\"Steward's Massachusetts hospitals are in deep financial distress and appear to be in danger of closure because of years of mismanagement, private equity schemes, and executive profiteering,\" the letter said.\n\nIn Monday's news release about the bankruptcy filing, Steward pointed to factors such as \"continuing to face challenges created by insufficient reimbursement by government payors as a result of decreasing reimbursement rates while at the same time facing skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\n\"It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system,\" the news release said.\n\nAmong Steward's top executives is Ruben King-Shaw Jr., a former secretary of the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration who serves as the company's chief strategy officer, according to the company's website.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6

Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" Dr. Ralph de la Torre, chief executive officer of Steward, said in a statement.\n\nTo continue operating, Steward said it is \"finalizing the terms\" of $75 million in \"debtor-in-possession financing\" from Medical Properties Trust, an Alabama-based real estate investment trust that bought Steward's Massachusetts hospital buildings in 2016. Steward said it expects to receive $225 million more if it meets certain conditions.\n\n\"Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change,\" the company added in its statement.\n\nSteward employs tens of thousands of workers, including 16,000 in Massachusetts.

At Steward Medical Group, the company's employed physician group, physicians provide more than six million patient encounters per year.\n\nThere are over 7,900 beds under Steward's management, according to the website.\n\nBy filing for bankruptcy, the Dallas-based company will become eligible for debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust, the company that owns the buildings Steward operates in.

The filing marks the largest provider bankruptcy in decades, according to Laura Coordes, professor of law at the Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law at Arizona State University.\n\nRegulators and experts have been anticipating the filing since April 30, when the for-profit chain missed its deadline to pay back at least a portion of its $750 million debt to half a dozen lenders. The private lenders, it appears, declined to extend Steward further credit.\n\nThe operator said its is working to finalize terms of debtor-in-possession financing from its landlord, Medical Properties Trust, for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million in funding upon the satisfaction of additional terms, according to a Monday press release.\n\nIn Massachusetts, where Steward operates eight hospitals, lawmakers have been preparing for this day for months.\n\nRegulators escalated their efforts to receive financial information from distressed Steward beginning this winter. They first sent letters requesting information about the system's financial health and a plan for action. Then they invited Steward to public hearings to brief the community about the brewing crisis -- Steward officials were a no-show.\n\nFinally, officials hunkered down late last month for closed-door contingency planning sessions to consider how a possible Steward bankruptcy might impact Massachusetts' health system writ large.\n\nAmong those present during April 24's strategy session were David Seltz, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, which oversees the finances of hospitals in the state; Kate Walsh, secretary of Massachusetts' Health and Human Services; and Robbie Goldstein, commissioner of the state's Department of Public Health.\n\nWalsh described the meetings to the Boston Globe as going \"to bankruptcy school\" to map out all the possible outcomes that could come with a filing. Walsh stressed that hospitals would not necessarily close when Steward declared bankruptcy and entered restructuring -- at least in the short term -- based on her conversations with experts.\n\nHowever, Seltz is concerned the state's Southeastern region can't withstand any disruption to care given the region is already rated by state officials as \"high risk for or active constraints on hospital capacity,\" according to testimony from Seltz on April 24.\n\nCapacity constraints could significantly worsen with healthcare service disruptions resulting from a Steward bankruptcy, warned Seltz. He added southeastern Massachusetts residents are particularly vulnerable to disruptions in care because they have lower-than-average incomes and \"substantial\" care access challenges.\n\n\"These compounding challenges signal the need for collaborative action to ensure the stability of the health care landscape in Southeastern Massachusetts,\" Seltz said in a statement accompanying his testimony.\n\nSteward said it does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process.\n\nMonday morning, the Massachusetts HHS released a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter, saying the state had been preparing for this outcome and had plans in place to preserve care access,\n\n\"Steward hospitals remain open, and patients should not hesitate to seek care. The Healey-Driscoll administration is working with Steward and any potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs and stabilizes our health care system,\" the HHS said.\n\nAlthough Steward put forth a plan to return to financial good standing in February, experts were dubious about whether the health system could execute a turnaround in such short order -- especially given the plan was dependent on asset sales.\n\nSteward said it would sell its physician group, Stewardship Health, and re-tenant some of its hospital portfolio to free up liquidity to pay down debts.\n\nHowever, as of April 24, the HPC said it had not begun its formal review of the deal, noting it was yet to receive all of the documents required to do so.\n\nIn a statement Monday about the bankruptcy, CEO Ralph de la Torre said the delayed sale contributed to the bankruptcy filing.\n\n\"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment,\" said de la Torre. \"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations.\"\n\nThe CEO also said external factors contributed to the company's financial woes, citing insufficient reimbursement from government payers, high labor costs, inflationary pressures and lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSteward has earned a reputation for being secretive about its finances. In February, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey accused Steward of acting like a black box to obscure regulatory efforts and hide its financial condition.\n\nThe health system has spent years immersed in a legal battle with Massachusetts regulators over submitting routine financial data for auditing, citing the need to protect confidential business information.\n\nThe company has also failed to provide its own landlord with audited year-end financials, according to MPT's 2023 annual report. MPT was required to disclose Steward's 2022 audited financials to the Securities and Exchange Commission because Steward accounted for more than 20% of MPT's assets that year.\n\nThe watchdog agency requested Steward's financial information from MPT over 200 days ago in July, and has since sent two follow-up letters, according to MPT's annual report. Steward has maintained the documents are unavailable.\n\nWith limited data, analysts told Healthcare Dive that it became very difficult to see the full scope of Steward's struggles. Even Stuart Altman, who chaired the Massachusetts regulatory agency charged with overseeing hospital spending between 2012 and 2022, said his board missed the full scope of Steward's problems.",

The company is asking for $75 million to start its bankruptcy case, with up to $225 million at a later date.\n\n\"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations,\" Steward CEO Ralph de la Torre said Monday.\n\n\"With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained,\" de la Torre added in a statement.\n\nSteward employees 4,500 primary and specialty care physicians with 3,600 staffed beds and nearly 30,000 employees. Steward Health Care provides care to more than two million patients annually.\n\nThe company recently closed a hospital in Massachusetts. State officials and politicians have said it did not disclose the extent of its financial troubles until they were deep enough to imperil medical care in eight remaining hospitals it operates in the commonwealth.\n\nMassachusetts Governor Maura Healey said in a Monday press conference that her team has been working to minimize the bankruptcy's impact on patients, and she would support an orderly bankruptcy sale away from Steward's \"failed management team.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, this is a step toward our goal of getting Steward out of Massachusetts,\" Healey said.\n\nSteward's court-supervised bankruptcy will provide transparency into the company's finances, so that its \"failed management team\" will \"no longer be able to lie\" about its debts, the governor added.\n\nSteward filed for bankruptcy with between $1 billion and $10 billion in liabilities, according to its Chapter 11 petition filed in Houston, Texas bankruptcy court.

On Friday, the state activated an \"emergency operations plan\" to ensure patients had continued access to the hospital system.\n\nSteward is finalizing the terms of a $75 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement with Medical Properties Trust, its de-facto landlord, that could provide the company an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\" Debtor-in-possession financing is only available to companies in bankruptcy, and serves as a lifeline for companies in financial distress, according to Corporate Finance Institute.\n\nDespite the bankruptcy filing, Steward intends for its hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices to remain open and continue serving patients.\n\nFiling for bankruptcy was a \"necessary measure to allow the company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption,\" the statement reads.\n\nRalph de la Torre, the company's chief executive officer, said Steward has done \"everything in its power\" to operate successfully in what he dubbed a \"highly challenging health care environment.\" Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy is \"in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" he said.\n\nIn March, Steward announced that it planned to sell its network of doctors to a wing of the for-profit UnitedHealth Group for an undisclosed sum, WBUR reported at the time.\n\nAnd in April, the company followed through on its planned shuttering of New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, a move that resulted in the loss of 39 rehabilitation service beds, 119 chronic care beds, and all ambulatory care at the hospital, according to a filing the struggling health care company made with state regulators in January.\n\nThe court-supervised bankruptcy process will leave Steward \"better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nCompany officials also blamed the filing on Steward receiving insufficient reimbursements from government payors like Medicare and Medicaid while it faced \"skyrocketing\" labor costs, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased material and operational costs from inflation.\n\n\"It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system,\" the statement reads.\n\nSteward announced in February that it had secured an additional $150 million in bridge financing, on top of a $600 million loan it received in the summer of 2023, according to Business Wire.

The system also reported continuing to experience negative financial effects from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn March, Steward revealed plans to sell its physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. If the deal closes, the system's physicians would become employed by Optum. Delays in finalizing the deal contributed to the system's financial issues, Dr. de la Torre said.\n\n\"In the past several months we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at our hospitals,\" he said. \"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations.\"\n\nLawmakers have been investigating Steward's financial situation over the last several months amid hospital closures and vendor complaints of unpaid bills. One of Steward's hospitals in San Antonio closed last year amid unpaid bills, and the system shut down New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, Mass., in April.\n\nIn some cases, vendors stopped sending supplies to Steward hospitals with unpaid bills, prompting surgery cancellations and other issues. Steward also fell $50 million behind on rent and took loans from its landlord, Medical Properties Trust.\n\nSteward also announced May 6 plans to finalize terms of debtor-in-possession financing for initial funding of $75 million and up to another $225 million from MPT if it meets certain conditions.\n\n\"With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained,\" said Dr. de la Torre. \"By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts Nurses Association and 1199SSEIU United Healthcare Workers East released a joint statement responding to the bankruptcy filing, noting the possible loss of any facilities in Massachusetts would have \"devastating consequences.\" The organizations call on legislators and healthcare industry leaders to take needed steps to preserve existing hospitals and clinics, and transition to nonprofit ownership.\n\n\"One only need look at what has happened in Southeastern Mass with the loss of Norwood Hospital and Brockton Hospital, where the influx of patients has stressed the region's already overburdened emergency departments, to see what lies in store with the loss of these other facilities. No amount of contingency planning between the DPH and hospital executives can stem the inevitable and unnecessary injury and death that would result from a failure to preserve these resources,\" the

Maura Healey stressed today.\n\n\"Steward hospitals remain open,\" Healey said. She repeated that statement and added that you can \"continue to seek care when you need it.\"\n\nBut Healey admitted she \"can't guarantee\" what might happen next, but \"getting Steward out of Massachusetts\" is the goal. The chain employs 1,600 and serves 200,000 in Massachusetts alone, Healey added.\n\nIn a pre-dawn statement, Steward said it has \"commenced an in-court restructuring process\" under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n\nThat move is being \"finalized\" for both a \"debtor-in-possession financing from Medical Properties Trust for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust,\" the company said in the statement.\n\nThat will keep the doors open, but the fallout is hitting New England hard. What may come next, however, has many concerned.\n\n\"The potential loss of any of these facilities will have devastating consequences for hundreds of thousands of residents from the South Shore to southern New Hampshire,\" the state nurses and 1199SEIU health care workers' unions said in a joint statement today.\n\nState monitors have been in place in the company's Bay State hospitals since January, after it was revealed the health care provider is apparently behind on its debts enough to find itself embroiled in several lawsuits from suppliers and the owners of the land on which the hospitals sit.\n\nOn Friday, Healey's administration launched an \"emergency operations plan\" aimed at dealing with whatever fallout may come from Steward's dire financial circumstances and the potential for disruption to patient care at any of the company's eight operational Bay State hospitals.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh said today the state has been preparing for this day and will send a representative to the Chapter 11 proceedings in Texas to guard the Bay State's interests.\n\n\"The hospitals that were open yesterday remain open today,\" Walsh said at a press conference with the governor and state Attorney General Andrea Campbell.\n\nWalsh added the bankruptcy filing will not change providers or community care. \"What bankruptcy does mean is that a federal court in Texas will be working with Steward creditors, our legal representation and others to address their financial challenges,\" she said.\n\nA website, and later today a hotline, are being rolled out for Steward patients to seek additional answers, the governor added. The website is dedicated to Steward hospitals in Massachusetts.\n\nThis weekend, House Speaker Ron Mariano said a hospital oversight bill under consideration in the lower chamber would require hospital owners to open their books to lawmakers, ensuring a level of transparency that Steward has apparently refused.\n\nFor today, Steward said it had no choice but to seek bankruptcy protection.\n\n\"Steward took this voluntary step today as a necessary measure to allow the Company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption. Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process,\" they added.\n\n\"Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change,\" the statement ends.\n\nAG Campbell said the state will keep \"advocating for patients and workers\" while guarding against any attempt by Steward to seek \"profit to the determent of patients.\"\n\nSteward facilities include Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holyoke Hospitals in Haverhill and Methuen, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Saint Anne's Hospital in Fall River and St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton. Their Norwood Hospital has been closed since 2020 due to flooding, and the company recently closed New England Sinai Hospital permanently.\n\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.", "source": {"uri": "unionleader.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UnionLeader.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Properties_Trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical Properties Trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maura Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debtor-in-possession_financing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debtor-in-possession financing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Walsh_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Walsh (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward_Health_Care_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steward Health Care System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwood,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norwood, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Norwood, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1199SEIU_United_Healthcare_Workers_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Shore_(Massachusetts)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Shore (Massachusetts)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Mariano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Mariano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwood_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norwood Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashoba_Valley_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashoba Valley Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carney_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carney Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_P._Morton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levi P.

Will it affect you?", "body": "Steward Health Care, the largest physician-owned healthcare network in the U.S., with hospitals across the country and in Florida, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSteward, which owns Palmetto General Hospital in Hialeah and North Shore Medical Center in North Miami-Dade, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nThe Dallas-based company, which was founded by Cuban American and Floridian Dr. Ralph de la Torre, promised in a statement that patient care will not be affected during the bankruptcy process.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nWhich Florida hospitals does Steward Health Care own?\n\nSteward Health Care operates eight hospitals in Florida and five are in South Florida:\n\n\u25aa Palmetto General Hospital, 2001 W 68 St. in Hialeah\n\n\u25aa Coral Gables Hospital, 3100 Douglas Rd. in Coral Gables\n\n\u25aa Hialeah Hospital, 651 E 25th St. in Hialeah\n\n\u25aa North Shore Medical Center, 1100 NW 95th St. in North Miami-Dade\n\n\u25aa Florida Medical Center, 5000 W. Oakland Park Blvd. in Lauderdale Lakes\n\nSteward bought the South Florida hospitals from Tenet Healthcare for $1.1 billion in 2021, as the Miami Herald has previously reported. Steward's other Florida hospitals are Melbourne Regional Medical Center, Rockledge Regional Center and Sebastian River Medical Center.\n\nSteward Health Care files for bankruptcy: What does it mean?\n\nSteward, which reportedly has more than $1 billion in debt, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which lets businesses reorganize their debt while continuing to operate.\n\nThe company, in a statement, said it's in the process of negotiating terms in court for a loan from Medical Trust Properties, the landlord that owns all of Steward's real estate, for \"initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million.\"\n\nSteward's hospitals and medical centers will remain open and doctors can keep caring for patients during the bankruptcy process.\n\nWill Steward Health bankruptcy affect patient care?\n\nSteward, which has more than 30 hospitals in the country, said it doesn't expect the bankruptcy process to affect \"day-to-day operations.\"\n\n\"Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change,\" Steward said in a statement.\n\nHowever, it's too soon to say what will happen to Steward's hospitals and medical centers once the bankruptcy process is over, according to John McDonough, a professor of the practice of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has kept tabs on the Steward Health Care saga.\n\nWhen asked about what might happen to Steward's Florida hospitals, McDonough, speaking generally about how bankruptcy tends to work for healthcare systems, said it's possible some hospitals will be sold to another investor that wants to continue offering healthcare services. Hospitals could also be sold and converted to another type of business or be sold for their land and torn down for development.\n\n\"It's really too early to say what might be the result,\" McDonough said. \"And generally speaking, the facilities that cater to underserved populations tend to become the most vulnerable in these circumstances.\"\n\nWhat led Steward Health Care to bankruptcy?\n\nSteward CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre said the hospital system had recently taken steps to help stabilize operations, including securing \"bridge financing,\" which is a short-term loan, and selling its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of United HealthGroup\n\nIn a statement, de la Torre said the company decided to declare bankruptcy over rising costs and the delay in finalizing the sale of its physician network.\n\nHe also blamed decreasing and \"insufficient\" reimbursement rates by Medicare and Medicaid, \"skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nHere are the key things to know from McDonough, the Harvard expert:\n\n\u25aa The Steward saga began in 2010, when the Archdiocese of Boston sold its Caritas Christi Health Care system to New York investment firm Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus, the private equity firm, rebranded Caritas Christi Health to Steward Health Care System and began an \"aggressive expansion,\" buying up hospitals and other medical facilities across the country, he said.\n\n\u25aa In 2016, Steward sold all its real estate -- buildings and land, including its Florida hospitals -- for $1.25 billion to Medical Trust Properties, which the Wall Street Journal says is one of the largest U.S. hospital landlords in the country. While Steward was still running the operations, its hospitals now had to pay rent to Medical Trust Properties to operate on the same property Steward once owned. Steward used the profits it got to buy more hospitals, according to McDonough.\n\n\u25aa As Steward's money problems worsened, so did the conditions of its hospitals and ability to care for patients, with reports of delays in payments to workers and vendors, job losses, insufficient supplies and broken equipment at some places. Steward's financial crisis, the lavish lifestyle of its CEO, and its more than decade old refusal to provide financial information to Massachusetts, as is required by state law, eventually drew the eyes of Massachusetts government officials, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u25aa Bottom line: Steward's owners were more focused on making a profit quickly, and the debt caught up to them, according to McDonough. \"They felt they had no choice but to sell themselves out to Wall Street and people who rely on these facilities are now paying the price or will pay the price.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michelle_marchante@miamiherald.com", "name": "Michelle Marchante", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_Hospital_(Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salem Hospital (Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward_Health_Care_System", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steward Health Care System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hialeah,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hialeah, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hialeah, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonough,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McDonough, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "McDonough, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Gables,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coral Gables, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coral Gables, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Americans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cuban Americans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_bankruptcy_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States bankruptcy court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenet_Healthcare", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tenet Healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockledge,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rockledge, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rockledge, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Park,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Park, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Park, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauderdale_Lakes,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lauderdale Lakes, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lauderdale Lakes, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_T.H._Chan_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard T.H.

A case filed under Chapter 11 bankruptcy is frequently referred to as a \"reorganization\" bankruptcy, according to United States Courts.\n\nSteward Health operates Trumbull Memorial Medical Center, Hillside Rehabilitation Hospital and Sharon Regional Hospital, as well as other centers and testing facilities. However, most of the issues are centered around issues in Massachusetts where it operates nine facilities.\n\nIn previous talks with First News, some local centers under Steward Health say they should not be impacted. But that did not stop commissioners from taking preemptive actions to try and ensure quality health care and job security for employees.\n\nIn January, First News investigated after the company was having issues paying its rent, as well as some loan obligations. Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (MPT) -- a company that provides working capital for hospitals -- said the healthcare system is having issues with vendor payments and collections, impacting its ability to make good on payments. It said that according to third quarter 2023 reports, Steward delayed paying a portion of its September and October rent to MPT, even though Steward obtained \"additional working capital financing and selling its non-core laboratory business.\"\n\nIn Monday's release, Steward Health said the company is finalizing the terms of debtor-in-possession financing from MPT for initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million.\n\nThe company released the following impact statement:\n\n\"Steward took this voluntary step today as a necessary measure to allow the Company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption. Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process. Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change.\"\n\nIn April, Steward Health Care was the topic of a Senate subcommittee field hearing in Boston on Wednesday dealing with \"corporate greed\" in the healthcare sector.\n\nSteward Health Care was previously owned by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity company that generated $800 million in profit from Steward, according to a news release from Senator Edward J.

Dr. Vartan Yeghiazarians, president of the medical staff at Holy Family Hospital, said by last December the problems were causing some medical procedures to be delayed or canceled.\n\n\"I think that's when we started noticing that things were really off,\" Yeghiazarians said.\n\nState officials have been monitoring care at Steward facilities, which are located mainly in eastern Massachusetts. They announced Friday they had set up a command center to help manage the effects of any potential loss of services, hospital closures, transfers of ownership or a bankruptcy. Their focus, they have said, is maintaining the stability of the state's health care system.\n\nThe disclosure of Steward's financial woes in January sparked criticism of the role of for-profit companies in health care and calls for greater oversight. Massachusetts lawmakers recently proposed legislation that would more closely regulate hospitals in the state.\n\nThe bankruptcy process could reveal new details about Steward's financial straits -- and how the situation became untenable. The company has long kept financial records close to the vest, even defying a Massachusetts law requiring hospital companies to disclose detailed financial information.\n\nState officials in February demanded further documentation, but said the company did not fully comply with their deadline.\n\nAlthough Steward has said it is looking for a buyer for its Massachusetts hospitals, no deal has emerged to date.\n\n\"With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations,\" CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre wrote in Monday's statement. \"With the additional financing in this process, we are confident that we will keep hospitals open, supplied, and operating so that our care of our patients and our employees is maintained.\"\n\nState officials have indicated one obstacle to a buyer deal is Steward's lease arrangement with Medical Properties Trust. In 2016, Steward sold its Massachusetts hospital buildings and real estate to MPT. The sale proceeds helped Steward executives launch a national expansion but saddled their hospitals with rent.\n\nSteward has also been working to sell its physician network, Stewardship Health. In March Steward announced it had reached a deal with Optum, whose parent company, UnitedHealth Group, owns the larger insurer United Healthcare.

It also blamed \"insufficient reimbursement\" from Medicare and Medicaid, the federal health insurance programs for seniors and low-income residents, and higher costs of labor and medical supplies.\n\n\"It is Steward's goal to resolve the Chapter 11 process as quickly as possible, with the help of the court, with a view to the long-term and sustainable financial health of the system,\" the press release said.\n\nIt quoted Steward chief executive Ralph de la Torre as saying, \"Steward Health Care has done everything in its power to operate successfully in a highly challenging health care environment. Filing for Chapter 11 restructuring is in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time.\"\n\nThe fate of the hospitals' tens of thousands of patients, and its nearly 16,000 employees in Massachusetts, will be determined by a bankruptcy process in which Steward's lenders, deemed secured creditors, will hold an interest in the system as collateral. Some Steward hospitals have already seen employee departures and service cuts. Good Samaritan temporarily closed its Brockton cancer infusion center last month.\n\nAs part of the process, a US trustee working for the Justice Department will appoint a panel of unsecured creditors, a large cast ranging from staffing contractors to medical supplies firms, who will negotiate with Steward and its secured creditors about how to resolve its debts.\n\n\"By working collaboratively with stakeholders in this court-supervised controlled environment, and having the benefit of our earlier strategic efforts, Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities,\" de la Torre said in the statement.\n\nIndependent bankruptcy experts said Steward will be required to come up with a plan that could involve raising new capital and replacing management, in addition to selling some or all of its hospitals.\n\nThe plan would have to be filed within 120 days and approved by the bankruptcy judge, they said. If that doesn't happen, other parties of interest -- including the state of Massachusetts -- could submit alternative plans to reorganize the hospital system and enable it to emerge from bankruptcy.\n\n\"Getting into bankruptcy is easy,\" said D. Ethan Jeffery, an attorney for Boston law firm Murphy & King, who has represented debtors, trustees, and creditors in Chapter 11 cases. \"Getting out is the trick.\"\n\nTrustees in hospital bankruptcy filings also typically name an ombudsman to watch out for the interest of patients while debtors and creditors haggle over who gets paid and how much.\n\nWhile the state has a clear interest in keeping the hospitals open, and preventing a patient influx to other resource-strained hospitals, its role in the bankruptcy process will initially be limited. Governor Maura Healey has called on Steward to turn over the hospitals to new operators. So far, no formal bids for Steward hospitals have been disclosed.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh, who's been the governor's point person on the crisis, issued a statement reiterating that the Healey administration \"is working with Steward and any potential partners to support an orderly transfer of ownership that protects access to care, preserves jobs and stabilizes our health care system.\"\n\nWalsh's statement noted that the administration has been preparing for a bankruptcy filing and stressing that \"Steward hospitals remain open, and patients should not hesitate to seek care.\" Last week, state officials activated a command center to manage the fallout on the Massachusetts health system from the anticipated breakup of Steward's system.\n\nIn a statement, the Massachusetts Nurses Association and health care workers union 1199SEIU said that the state should use the bankruptcy process to protect health care assets.\n\n\"The bankruptcy declaration should only embolden the administration, the legislature, the healthcare industry, and all those who value the health of our communities to immediately take whatever steps are needed to ensure the preservation of these facilities and the safe transition to more stable and responsible not for profit ownership,\" the unions said.\n\nSteward operates two Boston hospitals, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, and Carney Hospital in Dorchester. It also runs Good Samaritan in Brockton, Holy Family in Methuen and Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley in Ayer, and Saint Anne's in Fall River.\n\nSteward-operated Norwood Hospital was temporarily shut down because of flooding in 2020. A rebuilding effort stalled earlier this year when contractors halted work, saying they hadn't been paid.\n\nMost of the hospitals were formerly part of the Caritas Christi Health Care, a Catholic system run for decades by the Boston Archdiocese. Steward, backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management of New York, acquired the Caritas hospitals in 2010, converting them into for-profit institutions before launching a national expansion.\n\nUnder the bankruptcy procedure, Steward will likely be obliged to disclose far more detailed financial information than it has in the past. The company has not publicly filed financials since 2020, when Steward Health Care System reported a $407 million loss.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing will also shine a spotlight on the multimillion-dollar rent obligations Steward hospitals have had to pay to MPT, the real estate investment trust that bought the Massachusetts hospital buildings in 2016 for $1.2 billion. In 2021, Steward paid out a $111 million dividend to equity owners, including chief executive de la Torre, a former heart surgeon, according to a lawsuit filed against the company by a California medical staffing firm.\n\nSteward's cash crunch came to light in January when its commercial landlord, MPT, disclosed that the health system hadn't been paying full rent for months. The company, which moved its headquarters from Boston to Dallas in 2018, has also been sued by at least two dozen vendors alleging they weren't paid for supplies and services.\n\nOne big question hovering over the future of the hospitals is whether any new operators would inherit the rents Steward agreed to pay MPT, a major disincentive for would-be buyers of its hospitals.\n\n\"The big problem in the Steward situation is they no longer own the buildings and they have these lease payments,\" said Jeffery, the Boston bankruptcy lawyer. Most of the hospitals also operate in low-income communities, where lower-paying government health insurers such as Medicaid and Medicare account for much of their revenue, he said.\n\n\"In these areas, the economics of health care don't work without the help of the government,\" he said. \"Whoever's going to buy these hospitals is still stuck with a fundamental problem that's hard to fix.\"\n\nAnother question is how the bankruptcy will affect Steward's plan to sell its doctors network, Stewardship Health, to the Optum unit of insurance giant UnitedHealth. The parties have negotiated a letter of intent but have yet to disclose a purchase price or file a definitive asset purchase agreement with Massachusetts regulators.\n\nBefore the bankruptcy, Steward had been counting on the transaction to help pay off lenders. But the state review process won't formally begin until Steward and Optum finalize their purchase agreement, and it could take as long as nine months. Regulators from other agencies, including the Massachusetts attorney general, the Federal Trade Commission, and the US Justice Department, may also review the deal.", "source": {"uri":

Shah, Bloomberg News The Tribune Content Agency\n\nSteward Health Care System LLC filed for bankruptcy early Monday after a period of mounting financial challenges and government scrutiny over the impact of its hospital closures on patients.\n\nThe Dallas-based firm is finalizing a rescue loan with landlord Medical Properties Trust Inc., according to the filing. It sought Chapter 11 protection in the Southern District Court of Texas and listed both assets and liabilities of $1 billion to $10 billion.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing allows Steward Health to keep operating while it seeks approval for a restructuring plan. Steward operates more than 30 hospitals across eight states and employs some 30,000 people, according to its bankruptcy website. It's the biggest private for-profit hospital chain in the country.\n\nSteward's liquidity crisis deepened this year as it struggled to pay vendors and manage operations at its sites. The system moved to close hospitals, including several in Massachusetts, to cut costs. That prompted significant pushback and inquiry from the state's politicians, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\nIt also moved to sell its managed services organization and hired consultancy AlixPartners for operational help, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMedical properties\n\nAs part of the restructuring deal, Medical Properties - a U.S. real estate trust focused on health care facilities - is set to provide initial debtor-in-possession funding of $75 million and an additional loan of as much as $225 million if certain conditions are met, it said in a statement. In January, Medical Properties provided Steward Health with a $60 million bridge loan and deferred some of its rent arrears.\n\nMedical Properties fell as much as 11.5% in Monday trading as of 11:20 a.m. New York time. MPT has been the subject of short attack for its finances and exposure to Steward.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers including Warren have also written to Cerberus Capital Management about concerns regarding the private equity firm's role in Steward's finances. Private equity firm Cerberus created Steward after buying St. Elizabeth's and five other Catholic hospitals in Massachusetts in 2010.\n\nCerberus made a roughly $800 million profit on its investment before offloading its remaining interest to doctors in the company, including Steward's now-Chief Executive Officer Ralph de la Torre, Bloomberg reported in 2021.\n\nThe company blamed higher costs and insufficient government-program reimbursement among the factors leading to the Chapter 11 filing. The delay in the sale of its physician business unit Stewardship Health forced it to look for an alternative source of funding.\n\nThrough the bankruptcy process, \"Steward will be better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities,\" de la Torre said in a statement.\n\nThe case is Steward Health Care System LLC, 24-90213, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District Court of Texas.\n\n(With assistance from Bre

The Steward Health Care System is the largest physician-led hospital operator in the United States.In a Chapter 11 filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Steward pointed to increased operational costs, insufficient Government reimbursements, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic as major reasons for their financial difficulties. As part of the bankruptcy filing, Steward Health is negotiating debtor-in-possession financing terms with Medical Properties Trust. It anticipates an initial funding approval of $75 million, with a potential for an additional $225 million.Ralph de la Torre, Steward's Chief Executive Officer, stated that they have secured bridge financing and made strides towards the sale of their Stewardship Health business in recent months which aimed to stabilize operations across all their hospitals. However, delay in the transaction has compelled Steward to explore other ways to support their operations.Steward Health Care, based in Dallas, Texas, is under intense financial pressure as its struggles with government's inadequate reimbursement rates, escalating labor expenses, inflation-driven rise in material and operational costs, and persistent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these challenges, the company insists that it will continue to maintain hospital operations and patient care aided by the additional financing.The company currently manages hospitals across multiple states, including Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas. It is a significant private for-profit health system, operating 33 hospitals and employing 33,000 people in the United States as of the start of 2024.Previously, in January, Medical Properties Trust reported that Steward owed approximately $50 million in overdue rent, leading them to intend to minimize their investment in Steward. It was also revealed that Steward was considering strategic transactions such as potential sales of certain hospital operations and divesting non-core operations.Steward now expects to proceed with necessary patient care in their communities despite their financial predicament. They do not foresee any operational disruption throughout the bankruptcy process. In fact, they assure that Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's clinics remain open and will continue to serve patients.At the end of initial trading on the NYSE, Medical Properties Trust's shares were priced at $4.39, signifying a decline by 9.86%.The material has been provided by InstaForex Company -

Will it affect you?", "body": "Steward Health Care, the largest physician-owned healthcare network in the U.S., with hospitals across the country and in Florida, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\n\nSteward, which owns Palmetto General Hospital in Hialeah and North Shore Medical Center in North Miami-Dade, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas.\n\nThe Dallas-based company, which was founded by Cuban American and Floridian Dr. Ralph de la Torre, promised in a statement that patient care will not be affected during the bankruptcy process.\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nSteward Health Care operates eight hospitals in Florida and five are in South Florida:\n\n\u25aa Palmetto General Hospital, 2001 W 68 St. in Hialeah\n\n\u25aa Coral Gables Hospital, 3100 Douglas Rd. in Coral Gables\n\n\u25aa Hialeah Hospital, 651 E 25th St. in Hialeah\n\n\u25aa North Shore Medical Center, 1100 NW 95th St. in North Miami-Dade\n\n\u25aa Florida Medical Center, 5000 W. Oakland Park Blvd. in Lauderdale Lakes\n\nSteward bought the South Florida hospitals from Tenet Healthcare for $1.1 billion in 2021, as the Miami Herald has previously reported. Steward's other Florida hospitals are Melbourne Regional Medical Center, Rockledge Regional Center and Sebastian River Medical Center.\n\nSteward, which reportedly has more than $1 billion in debt, filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which lets businesses reorganize their debt while continuing to operate.\n\nThe company, in a statement, said it's in the process of negotiating terms in court for a loan from Medical Trust Properties, the landlord that owns all of Steward's real estate, for \"initial funding of $75 million and up to an additional $225 million.\"\n\nSteward's hospitals and medical centers will remain open and doctors can keep caring for patients during the bankruptcy process.\n\nSteward, which has more than 30 hospitals in the country, said it doesn't expect the bankruptcy process to affect \"day-to-day operations.\"\n\n\"Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change,\" Steward said in a statement.\n\nHowever, it's too soon to say what will happen to Steward's hospitals and medical centers once the bankruptcy process is over, according to John McDonough, a professor of the practice of public health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who has kept tabs on the Steward Health Care saga.\n\nWhen asked about what might happen to Steward's Florida hospitals, McDonough, speaking generally about how bankruptcy tends to work for healthcare systems, said it's possible some hospitals will be sold to another investor that wants to continue offering healthcare services. Hospitals could also be sold and converted to another type of business or be sold for their land and torn down for development.\n\n\"It's really too early to say what might be the result,\" McDonough said. \"And generally speaking, the facilities that cater to underserved populations tend to become the most vulnerable in these circumstances.\"\n\nSteward CEO Dr. Ralph de la Torre said the hospital system had recently taken steps to help stabilize operations, including securing \"bridge financing,\" which is a short-term loan, and selling its nationwide physician network to Optum, a subsidiary of United HealthGroup\n\nIn a statement, de la Torre said the company decided to declare bankruptcy over rising costs and the delay in finalizing the sale of its physician network.\n\nHe also blamed decreasing and \"insufficient\" reimbursement rates by Medicare and Medicaid, \"skyrocketing labor costs, increased material and operational costs due to inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nHere are the key things to know from McDonough, the Harvard expert:\n\n\u25aa The Steward saga began in 2010, when the Archdiocese of Boston sold its Caritas Christi Health Care system to New York investment firm Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus, the private equity firm, rebranded Caritas Christi Health to Steward Health Care System and began an \"aggressive expansion,\" buying up hospitals and other medical facilities across the country, he said.\n\n\u25aa In 2016, Steward sold all its real estate -- buildings and land, including its Florida hospitals -- for $1.25 billion to Medical Trust Properties, which the Wall Street Journal says is one of the largest U.S. hospital landlords in the country. While Steward was still running the operations, its hospitals now had to pay rent to Medical Trust Properties to operate on the same property Steward once owned. Steward used the profits it got to buy more hospitals, according to McDonough.\n\n\u25aa As Steward's money problems worsened, so did the conditions of its hospitals and ability to care for patients, with reports of delays in payments to workers and vendors, job losses, insufficient supplies and broken equipment at some places. Steward's financial crisis, the lavish lifestyle of its CEO, and its more than decade old refusal to provide financial information to Massachusetts, as is required by state law, eventually drew the eyes of Massachusetts government officials, including U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren.\n\n\u25aa Bottom line: Steward's owners were more focused on making a profit quickly, and the debt caught up to them, according to McDonough. \"They felt they had no choice but to sell themselves out to Wall Street and people who rely on these facilities are now paying the price or will pay the price.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

At Monday's all-star press conference headlined by Governor Maura Healey, there was a lot of self-congratulatory talk about how the company's predawn filing for bankruptcy protection came as no surprise -- which is nothing to brag about since Steward's financial collapse has been making headlines since January. Healey's main message was that people should not be afraid to use the Steward-owned hospitals that are open for business.\n\nThe key concerns of the moment -- who, if anyone, might step up to take over those hospitals, where will the money come from to invest in them, how much state funding is available to keep them viable and which hospitals might need to be closed or re-purposed -- were not addressed by Healey or other state officials. The only speakers who directly referenced hope for transitioning to new ownership were two union leaders who represent thousands of hospital employees whose jobs depend upon the continued survival of facilities that are now part of a long and winding Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. Steward, which serves some 200,000 patients annually, operates eight hospitals in eastern Massachusetts, but its Norwood Hospital remains closed due to a flood.\n\nHealey has called upon Steward to turn over the hospitals to new operators, but so far, no formal bids have been disclosed, the Globe has reported. It won't be easy to find any takers, given that Steward sold the hospital buildings to a real estate investment trust, which is on its list of creditors. \"It's clearly a challenge,\" Alan Sager, a professor of health law, policy and management at Boston University School of Public Health, said via email. \"Money, expertise, and willingness would be required. Along with patience -- to navigate fraught relations with doctors, nurses, and other hospital workers. And skill and foresight to re-weave networks of care among doctors, other caregivers, and patients\" -- all while fending off the proposed purchase of Steward's doctors' group to UnitedHealth's Optum.\n\nSaving Steward's hospitals, or at least most of them, and the crucial network of community care they represent is important to the long-term stability of the Massachusetts health care system. So is making sure the sorry lessons of the Steward tenure in Massachusetts are learned. The saga began in 2008 when Ralph de la Torre, a surgeon with no hospital management experience, took over Caritas Christi Health Care, a troubled network of hospitals then affiliated with the Archdiocese of Boston.\n\nIn 2010, de la Torre engineered the sale of Caritas to Steward, a holding company for Cerberus, a New York-based private equity firm. This transfer to for-profit health care ownership happened with sign off from Massachusetts regulators and continued in the face of Steward's ongoing financial struggles. Meanwhile, de la Torre was acquiring yachts and other toys that go along with great wealth. Plug his name into federal or state campaign finance reports and you also find that he was contributing thousands of dollars to Massachusetts politicians at all levels of government.\n\nAt the press conference, Healey said that one of the benefits of Chapter 11 bankruptcy is that Steward, its CEO, and its management team \"will no longer be able to lie\" about its financial standing. Now, a key question is what Massachusetts will do to strengthen its laws so that full and accurate data reporting is required in real time and the law has the teeth needed for enforcement. Sager, an overall critic of the state when it comes to health care oversight, believes that state government \"allowed for-profit businesses like Steward to make fancy promises to bail out troubled hospitals. And then it didn't watch Steward carefully.\"\n\nHealey has maintained that when she was attorney general, she did all she could to oversee Steward, given the restrictions of state law. At the press conference, she said what happened stemmed from \"greed, mismanagement, and a lack of transparency on the part of Steward leadership.\" It's a situation that should never have happened, she said, and she pledged that Massachusetts will make sure it does not happen again.\n\nThat pledge was echoed by Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell, who said her office stands ready to hold Steward accountable for any wrongdoing that comes to light through the bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nSince January, there has been a great deal of huffing and puffing about the money Steward has made in Massachusetts at the expense of the people it was supposed to serve, along with the money de la Torre has personally harvested from the mission of providing health care to some of the state's most vulnerable residents.\n\nIf you think that's morally outrageous, remember that it all happened with the blessing of the state's politicians, in the warm embrace of the Boston business community. Morally, there is now a collective duty to make things right.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maura Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward_Health_Care_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steward Health Care System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Massachusetts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Massachusetts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Boston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_11,_Title_11,_United_States_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caritas_Christi_Health_Care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caritas Christi Health Care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwood_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norwood Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University_School_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston University School of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UnitedHealth Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgeon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_investment_trust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate investment trust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_equity_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private equity firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campaign_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campaign finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/M7BPGDgP8gDCcSxzSzQWyNqT7aY=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/GDL3MJOTV2V2KELQTUYXRHL364.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542158", "eventUri": "eng-9542158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

The firm is currently negotiating a debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing arrangement from Medical Properties Trust (MPT). DIP financing, available to firms that have filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, allows companies to raise capital to fund operations while the bankruptcy process progresses. Lenders who provide DIP financing get priority over existing debt holders, equity holders, and other claims.\n\nThe health care system owns and operates 33 community hospitals across nine states in the country, employing more than 40,000 people.\n\nUnder Steward's financing arrangement with MPT, the establishment is seeking initial funding of $75 million and additional funds of $225 million.\n\n\"Steward took this voluntary step today as a necessary measure to allow the company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption,\" the press release stated.\n\nOther factors that have contributed to Steward's decision to file for bankruptcy are \"insufficient reimbursement\" from the Medicaid and Medicare programs, rising material and operational costs due to inflation, surging labor costs, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Steward said it intends to resolve the Chapter 11 process \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Steward does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations, which will continue in the ordinary course throughout the Chapter 11 process. Steward's hospitals, medical centers, and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change,\" it stated.\n\nDr. Ralph de la Torre, CEO of Steward, said the firm had done \"everything in its power\" to continue operating in a \"highly challenging\" environment.\n\nThe company finally decided that filing for Chapter 11 restructuring would best serve the interests of its employees, patients, physicians, and communities.\n\n\"In the past several months, we have secured bridge financing and progressed the sale of our Stewardship Health business in order to help stabilize operations at all of our hospitals. With the delay in closing of the Stewardship Health transaction, Steward was forced to seek alternative methods of bridging its operations,\" he said.\n\nIn 2016, Steward signed a $1.25 billion sale-leaseback agreement for its hospitals in Massachusetts with the Medical Properties Trust. In a sale-leaseback agreement, a business sells its assets and leases it back from the buyer. In effect, the business becomes the lessee and the buyer, the lessor. Such agreements are typically signed by enterprises to raise capital.\n\nIn the case of Steward, the sale-leaseback agreement with MPT resulted in the health care system getting burdened with \"hundreds of millions\" in rent each year, Lown notes.\n\nIn a Jan. 4 press release, MPT said that Steward had a total unpaid rent obligation of approximately $50 million as of December 2023. This was in addition to the roughly $50 million that was deferred previously.\n\nEarlier this month, the Massachusetts administration said it has activated its \"Emergency Operations Plan\" to ensure patient safety and protect access to care \"in the context of Steward Hospitals' financial challenges.\"\n\nSince January, the state's Department of Public Health has assigned monitors in Steward hospitals to \"assess whether the facilities have the necessary supplies, equipment, and staffing to deliver safe and effective care.\" These monitors remain in place.\n\nLown Institute noted that 70 percent of hospital patients at Steward's Massachusetts facilities were covered by Medicaid and Medicare. As such, the closure of these hospitals could lead to challenges for vulnerable populations.\n\nLast month, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) sent a letter to Edward K. Aldag, Jr., chairman and CEO of MPT, and Karl Kuchel, CEO of Macquarie Infrastructure Partners (MIP), asking them to engage in stabilizing Steward's facilities in the state.\n\nIn addition to MPT, MIP also has a stake in Steward's Massachusetts hospitals. Both investors \"have been collecting huge lease payments from Steward on property the company used to own. This is a key reason that Steward's Massachusetts hospitals have huge debts that have driven the company to the financial brink,\" the senators claimed in a press release.\n\nIn the letter, the senators insisted that since \"MPT and MIP have played a key role in this steep financial decline\" of Steward, they \"must play a role in the recovery of these hospitals in order to preserve and protect access to care for communities in Massachusetts.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since then, they've allegedly missed tens of million in rent payments to their new landlords, Medical Properties Trust. This sell-and-lease model would be prevented by the House's bill, according to the speaker.\n\nAnother problem, Mariano said, is the fact they've apparently never complied with state rules requiring them to disclose financial information to the state. The Quincy Democrat said the state won a court battle over the rule, but that the appeals process has dragged on since. The House bill, he said, would make that requirement more concrete.\n\n\"We're going to insist that hospitals open up their books, whether they are a private company or a not-for-profit,\" the speaker said.\n\n\"We've really never looked into how the money at Steward was spent, and that's a real problem,\" he said.\n\nLast week, Gov. Maura Healey's administration launched an \"emergency operations plan\" aimed at dealing with whatever fallout may come from Steward's dire financial circumstances and the potential for disruption to patient care at any of the company's eight operational Bay State hospitals.\n\nExecutive Office of Health and Human Services Kate Walsh said the decision was part of the state's \"continued response to Steward Health Care's financial challenges.\"\n\nPart of that preparation is for bankruptcy, Walsh said previously.\n\n\"Every day at 7:30, we have a stand-up call with leaders across government, external counsel, people across the health care system, other colleagues in other parts of government, to discuss what we know, what we've learned and how we're going to proceed,\" Walsh told the Senate Post Audit and Oversight Committee late last month. \"We also have expert advisors to guide us with respect to a national bankruptcy if that were to occur.\"\n\nWith last week's establishment of the emergency response center, officials have placed the state at the ready react to developments with Steward as they occur.\n\n\"As part of Emergency Operations activation, the Department has formalized an Incident Command System to coordinate the regional planning work already underway. The Incident Command System incorporates the ongoing external monitoring in all Steward hospitals, enables DPH to rapidly respond to any clinical needs or issues that arise, and fosters increased communication with other regional health care organizations, first responders and community leaders,\" DPH Commissioner Dr. Robert Goldstein said with the announcement.\n\nA spokesman for the EOHHS, when asked if the state was ready to respond to a possible Steward bankruptcy, would not elaborate, instead telling the Herald the state is working on a number of contingency plans to respond should Steward's financial circumstances grow worse.\n\nThe Incident Command will be led by Gregg Meyer, MD, who has spent decades as an executive at Mass General Brigham, MGH/MGPO, and Dartmouth Health. A practicing primary care physician, Meyer has worked in the federal government under two administrations. He has extensive experience in hospital operations and crisis management.\n\n\"This is the next step, and the responsible step in terms of making sure that we are prepared to do what we need to do when it comes to ensuring that patients have access to care, and that the health care market is stable,\" Healey told reporters on Friday.\n\nSteward facilities include Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holyoke Hospitals in Haverhill and Methuen, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Saint Anne's Hospital in Fall River, and St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton. Their Norwood Hospital closed in 2020 due to flooding, and the company recently closed New England Sinai Hospital.\n\nA spokesperson for Steward did not return a request for comment by press time.",

and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities,\" de la Torre said.\n\n-- Janine Phakdeetham for Bloomberg with assistance from Bre Bradham.\n\nAdvertisementRelated

Maura Healey on Monday urged patients to keep their appointments at Steward Healthcare's facilities across the state even as the financially troubled health system plunged into bankruptcy.\n\n\"This bankruptcy is something our administration has been preparing for. Steward Hospitals remain open. Patients should keep their appointments. You should continue to seek care when you need it at these facilities,\" the Democratic governor said during a hastily convened press conference at the State House.\n\nFlanked by senior aides, advocates, and labor leaders, Healey said Steward's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, which came in the early hours of Monday morning, was the first step toward \"our goal of getting Steward out of Massachusetts.\"\n\nSteward, which operates eight facilities, concentrated in eastern Massachusetts, has been the subject of intense scrutiny from state and federal officials in Massachusetts as more information came to light about its precarious financial position, which includes tens of millions of dollars in debt, MassLive reported.\n\nLast week, the state activated an \"emergency operations plan\" to ensure patients had continued access to the hospital system.\n\nOn Monday, Healey and public officials stressed that state monitors remain in place at Steward's hospitals to ensure quality of care for scores of patients who pass through those facilities every day.\n\n\"We know things won't be exactly the same on the other side [of the bankruptcy proceeding], but we will move forward,\" state Health and Human Services Secretary Kate Walsh said. \"While this is a national filing, it will be particularly disruptive in Eastern Massachusetts.\"\n\nWalsh said officials have set up a call center which was expected to be up and running later in the day on Monday. That complements an existing state website that is intended as a clearinghouse for resources.\n\n\"We are continuing to monitor these hospitals daily to make sure meet standards of care,\" Walsh continued. \"We'll be sending Massachusetts advocates to Texas to make sure [our] interests are protected at the very step of the process.\"\n\nSteward currently is finalizing the terms of a $75 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement with Medical Properties Trust, its de-facto landlord, that could provide the company an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust,\" MassLive previously reported.\n\nDebtor-in-possession financing is only available to companies in bankruptcy, and serves as a lifeline for companies in financial distress, according to Corporate Finance Institute.\n\nFiling for bankruptcy was a \"necessary measure to allow the company to continue to provide necessary care to its patients in their communities without disruption,\" the company said in a statement posted to its website.\n\nRalph de la Torre, the company's chief executive officer, said Steward has done \"everything in its power\" to operate successfully in what he dubbed a \"highly challenging health care environment.\" Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy is \"in the best interests of our patients, physicians, employees, and communities at this time,\" he said.\n\nIn March, Steward announced that it planned to sell its network of doctors to a wing of the for-profit UnitedHealth Group for an undisclosed sum, WBUR reported at the time.\n\nIn April, the company followed through on its planned shuttering of New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, a move that resulted in the loss of 39 rehabilitation service beds, 119 chronic care beds, and all ambulatory care at the hospital, according to a filing the struggling health care company made with state regulators in January.\n\nHealey, who has been sharply critical of for-profit Steward for what she said was the company's refusal to hand over key financial documents, has repeatedly called for the company to wind down its operations in the Bay State and transfer ownership of its facilities to nonprofit providers.\n\nHealey kept up that criticism on Monday, saying that she didn't want to \"lose sight of the fact that this situation stems from greed, mismanagement, and lack of transparency on the part of Steward's leadership in Dallas, Texas.\"\n\n\"It should never have happened, and we will take steps to make sure that it doesn't happen again,\" Healey continued. \"This has been, and remains an urgent priority for me, our entire administration, and our partners.\"\n\nAs Steward's bankruptcy case wends its way through the court system, officials in Massachusetts will be trying to answer two, big questions: How do officials ensure accountability, and how to make sure such a situation doesn't repeat itself, state Attorney General Andrea J. Campbell said.\n\nTwo labor leaders on hand Monday, Julie Pinkham, of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, and Tim Foley, of 1199 SEIU, pledged their cooperation.\n\n\"As this process unfolds, the voices of patients, workforce, and community must be heard and must have a seat at the table,\" Pinkham said. \"We look forward to transitioning these hospitals to new ownership.\"\n\nFoley, whose union represents some 5,000 workers across Steward's facilities in Massachusetts, offered a similar sentiment.\n\n\"We're all in this together,\" Foley said. \"We're unified in our goals: Protecting access [to care] and jobs, and supporting the communities and residents that these facilities serve.\"\n\nIn a statement, Massachusetts House Speaker Ronald J. Mariano, D-3rd Norfolk, said he had \"utmost confidence,\" in Healey and her lieutenants.\n\n\"I also have every belief in the ability of our hospital leaders to support the state's response, and in the health care providers who will continue to care for each and every patient that arrives at a Steward hospital in the months to come, regardless of what may be happening at a Texas bankruptcy court,\" Mariano said.\n\nSteward announced in February that it had secured an additional $150 million in bridge financing, on top of a $600 million loan it received in the summer of 2023, according to Business Wire. That loan would allow Steward \"to reset its operations and address vendor obligations,\" the wire service reported.", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"},

People can also go to mass.gov/stewardresources.\n\n\"The most important thing for patients and families to know is that their hospitals remain open and ready to care for you,\" US Representative Lori Trahansaid in a statement. \"There are thousands of dedicated physicians, nurses, and support personnel at Steward facilities who are working around the clock to make sure every single patient can get the care they need, and today's filing does not change that.\"\n\nHowever, Massachusetts is already facing a shortage of health care workers and state officials fear the uncertainty surrounding a bankruptcy may prompt Steward employees to seek other employment.\n\n\"We want to make sure there's adequate staff to care for patients, doctors, nurses, people who work in central supply, people who work at front desk, people who pass trays, people who answer the phone and clinic,\" said Secretary of Health and Human Services Kate Walsh.\"There's a lot of vacancies in this job market right now.\"\n\n\"Right now if you are working at a Steward hospital, thank you, thank you, thank you,\" Walsh said.\n\nHealth officials have had monitors in place since January to see whether Steward's hospitals have needed supplies, equipment, and staffing. The monitors will remain at the hospitals and continue to evaluate conditions for patients in the coming weeks, but their reports will now flow to a newly activated state \"command center,\" led by Dr. Gregg Meyer, a crisis management expert and a former executive at Mass General Brigham, the state's largest health system.\n\nState officials have also been meeting with other hospitals and community health centers that would have to handle an influx of patients if Steward cuts services or closes hospitals. With the current hospital occupancy rate topping 90 percent statewide, many facilities say they are already at or near their limits.\n\nHealey said bankruptcy might sound scary. But the process will ultimately allow the state to fully access Steward's financial information and better understand the risk to the state's health system.\n\n\"One of the good things about bankruptcy is that Steward and its CEO and its management team will no longer be able to lie,\" Healey said. \"That's why we look forward to seeing what is in the various (bankruptcy) documents that will be before the court because we need transparency. We need clarity about debts and liabilities as we assess opportunities and restructuring as we go forward.\"\n\nState leaders say they will consider bills to increase oversight over hospitals and to strengthen the state's health system.\n\n\"It is the Legislature's responsibility to ensure that what happened with Steward Health Care never happens again,\" House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement. \"Next week, the House will take up comprehensive legislation to address gaps in our regulatory process that Steward exploited, to stabilize the health care system, and to address the rising cost of health care.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maura Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Walsh_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kate Walsh (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward_Health_Care_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steward Health Care System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Call centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Mariano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron Mariano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_General_Brigham", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass General Brigham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_health_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community health center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Community_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Community Health", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/ss4gNipBRAjnAtKV1EmzBeJuD1o=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/WUDVPWGIQYHALVQXVXBJFDZA2M.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542158", "eventUri": "eng-9542158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

bankruptcy filing will not have 'negative impact'", "body": "Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre on Monday, the same day the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, sought to reassure employees that the bankruptcy filing was simply a way for the company to restructure its finances and would not impact its ability to continue operating the hospitals it owns, eight of which are in Massachusetts.\n\nIn a message sent to employees obtained by The Boston Globe, de la Torre blamed the financial troubles the company has faced on \"chronic government payor under-reimbursement rates, marked increases in Medicaid and behavioral health and unprecedented increases in free care.\"\n\nThose factors, along with increasing labor costs, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and inflation left the company in the financial position it now faces, he wrote.\n\nde la Torre also confirmed that each of the hospitals owned by Steward will remain open as bankruptcy proceedings play out.\n\n\"It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that this process has no impact on the quality care our patients, their families, and our communities can continue to receive care at our hospitals,\" he wrote, adding the bankruptcy process \"should not negatively impact our ability to operate and provide high-quality care to the communities we serve.\"\n\nThe company has been the subject of intense scrutiny from state and federal officials in Massachusetts as more information came to light about its precarious financial position, which includes tens of millions of dollars in debt, MassLive reported.\n\nOn Friday, the state activated an \"emergency operations plan\" to ensure patients had continued access to the hospital system.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Steward is finalizing the terms of a $75 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement with Medical Properties Trust, its de-facto landlord, that could provide the company an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\"\n\nDebtor-in-possession financing is only available to companies in bankruptcy, and serves as a lifeline for companies in financial distress, according to Corporate Finance Institute.\n\nIn March, Steward announced that it planned to sell its network of doctors to a wing of the for-profit UnitedHealth Group for an undisclosed sum, WBUR reported at the time.\n\nAnd in April, the company followed through on its planned shuttering of New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, a move that resulted in the loss of 39 rehabilitation service beds, 119 chronic care beds, and all ambulatory care at the hospital, according to a filing the struggling health care company made with state regulators in January.\n\nThe court-supervised bankruptcy process will leave Steward \"better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Its facilities have grappled with severe staff shortages that have threatened patient access to timely health care.\n\nIn March, Steward announced plans to sell its nationwide physician network to OptumCare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group. Last month, Steward also said it was forced to temporarily close a cancer unit at Brockton's Good Samaritan hospital due to a staffing shortage.\n\nA coalition of health care workers, residents, and community leaders recently organized a series of forums and rallies and launched an online petition urging state leaders to assist patients affected by the problems at Steward facilities.\n\n\"The loss of any of these facilities will deliver a devastating blow to the entire health care infrastructure in the commonwealth, particularly to some of the most vulnerable and marginalized patients and families,\" the coalition wrote in the petition. \"Patients will be subjected to dangerous delays in care, be forced to travel longer distances for care, and for many, to go without care altogether.\"", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "morgan_rousseau@boston.com", "name": "Morgan Rousseau", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steward_Health_Care_System", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steward Health Care System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Department_of_Public_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Department of Public Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fallout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Walsh_(actress)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kate Walsh (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greater Boston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Health_and_Human_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Health and Human Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_(U.S._state)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth (U.S. state)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UnitedHealth Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidiary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subsidiary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Facilities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Medical Relief", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient_Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/Patient Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Patient_Safety", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Patient Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/XTC67ITD6WMEUTERKRNI3FYBKY-6634e6b6c9ed8-768x432.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542158", "eventUri": "eng-9542158", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

This, coupled with sharp increases in labor costs, inflation, and the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have created an untenable situation for our organization.\"\n\nThe bankruptcy is designed to keep the hospitals \"open, supplied, and operating\" as the company sells its assets, wrote de la Torre, a former cardiac surgeon. This includes the acquisition of its physician network, Stewardship Health, by UnitedHealth's Optum unit. The decision to undergo bankruptcy proceedings, de la Torre said, was made \"on the information that the approval of the sale of Stewardship will take longer than we had anticipated.\"\n\n\"To be very clear -- all of Steward's hospitals, medical centers and physician's offices are open and continuing to serve patients and the broader community and our commitment to our employees will not change,\" de la Torre wrote. \"It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that this process has no impact on the quality care our patients, their families, and our communities can continue to receive at our hospitals.\"\n\nFor \"the vast majority\" of the Texas-based company's employees, he added, \"operations will either not be different or [will] improve.\"\n\n\"We know that the term 'bankruptcy' can raise some questions -- and we fully expect that there will be some distracting local and media commentary as a result of this announcement -- but this is an action that many organizations before Steward have undertaken, and one that many after Steward will undertake,\" he wrote.\n\nIn Massachusetts, Steward's hospitals include St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton, Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan in Brockton, Holy Family in Methuen and Haverhill, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley in Ayer, and Saint Anne's in Fall River. It also runs Norwood Hospital, which has been closed since 2020 due to flooding.\n\nIn his letter, de la Torre noted that Steward has \"remained committed to serving the socioeconomically vulnerable that many of our hospitals serve.\"\n\nWhile lower insurer reimbursement rates have been a common refrain from Steward executives regarding its dire financial straits, the numbers tell a different story.\n\nThe Massachusetts Health Policy Commission, an independent state agency, conducted an analysis showing that Steward hospitals, on whole, receive payments on par with or higher than many other state hospital systems. However, this analysis did not include fees for Medicare and Medicaid, federal health insurance programs that typically pay out lower amounts and cover a majority of Steward's patients, according to the health system.\n\nJust under 16,000 employees work for Steward in Massachusetts. In many cases, they have borne the brunt of Steward's financial crisis, with many choosing to leave as the system weathered supply and equipment shortages and service cuts.\n\nSteward's liabilities and assets are both in the $1 to 10 billion range, according to its bankruptcy filings.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [],

Healey cites 'greed, mismanagement and lack of transparency,' vows to advocate Massachusetts interests\n\nHours after Steward's announcement, Healey said this situation \"stems from and is rooted in greed, mismanagement and lack of transparency on the part of Steward leadership in Dallas, Texas.\"\n\n\"It's a situation that should never have happened and we will be working together to ensure that there are steps taken to make sure that this does not happen again,\" Healey said.\n\nMoving forward, Healey said her administration will be \"open, transparent and responsive to our communities every step of the way.\"\n\nWalsh said state officials would be sending representatives to Texas to represent Massachusetts interests in bankruptcy proceedings. Healey similarly said officials will advocate Massachusetts interests in the bankruptcy process.\n\nBack in Massachusetts, Walsh said state actions will be built around regional needs.\n\n\"We know the health care landscape in Methuen is different from the health care landscape in Taunton,\" she said.\n\nSteward in its statement said it does not expect any interruptions in its day-to-day operations during the bankruptcy process.\n\nSpeaking alongside Healey and others, state Attorney General Andrea Campbell said some of Steward's operations may still \"wind down in time.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of unknowns and a lot of variables that we do not have control of in the bankruptcy process. And I'm not na\u00efve about that,\" she said. \"...However, I want to stress that any changes in footprint will still be subject to state law.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 Sunbeam Television.

Taking out community hospitals like Steward's is \"very impactful\" to people with cancer, pushing particularly vulnerable patients father from accessible local care, providers they have relationships with and trust, and affordable care.\n\n\"I have really focused on access to care for poor folks, for Black and Brown communities and immigrant communities,\" said Latham. \"What you see for our community hospitals -- this is true for most of the community hospitals, but many of them in a Steward network -- they're taking care of a patient population that has the highest poverty level and that has the lowest resources.\"\n\nDana-Farber found when the institute partnered with a community hospital, the \"co-location model\" reduced time to cancer diagnosis from a median of 32 days to 12 days compared to diagnosing only within the Boston campus.\n\nEven just moving a patient's care from St. Elizabeth's in Brighton to the Longwood Medical Campus in Fenway, a 15-minute move, can create \"delays in care\" for patients, Latham said.\n\nResearch has found is it also significantly less expensive to be treated in a community hospital than a larger hospital. An analysis from the Massachusetts Center for Health Information and Analysis (CHIA), care at community hospitals cost about 7% less than the statewide average in 2021. Academic medical centers cost 9% more than the statewide average.\n\nThe financial crisis at Steward has led to challenges in delivering care, Latham added, as well as widespread morale issues among staff and patients.\n\n\"I've had patients who come to see me in the oncology clinic in St. Elizabeth's, where we're in the hospital, physically, some of the patients will come and say, 'Hey, what does this mean? Are you going to be here? Am I going to be able to see you? Is my care going to be disrupted?'\" said Latham.\n\nThe Boston-based cancer institute is guaranteeing none of its patients will lose access to care if any of the Steward hospitals close down and planning for contingencies. But Latham said he can't tell patients what the \"long-term issues will be\" as the future of their local care balances precariously.\n\nFinancial issues for community hospitals spread beyond the Steward crisis, affecting everyday patient care across the state.\n\n\"That's the role of this community hospital serve -- they serve the community in a very deep and enduring way because they've been there and this is where people have been going for years,\" Latham said. \"And it's nearby, transportation issues, access, all those things are really important. So they really do an incredible role in in to being the first place where many people go for the screening and early treatment.\"\n\nSteward facilities include Carney Hospital in Dorchester, Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Holyoke Hospitals in Haverhill and Methuen, Morton Hospital in Taunton, Nashoba Valley Medical Center in Ayer, Saint Anne's Hospital in Fall River and St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Brighton.

The decision to scrap the concession was confirmed on appeal, with courts finding \"\"collusion between Steward and senior government officials or its agencies\".\n\nSteward and the Maltese government have since been locked in arbitration proceedings.\n\nThe saga took a new turn last week, as news broke that a magisterial inquiry into the role of Joseph Muscat and several other public officials in the deal had been completed.\n\nThe inquiry spells bad news for many of the saga's most prominent faces.

There are thousands of dedicated physicians, nurses, and support personnel at Steward facilities who are working around the clock to make sure every single patient can get the care they need, and today's filing does not change that.\"\n\n\"It's clearer than ever that while Steward leaders spent the last decade publicly touting their hospitals as affordable community options, they deployed a devastating private equity business model behind closed doors focused on extracting every last cent of profit from facilities that serve working class communities. Ralph de la Torre and Steward executives paid themselves hundreds of millions of dollars, and they did so by racking up debt they knew they could never repay, even if it meant the closure of vital community hospitals in gateway cities across the Commonwealth. They should not be allowed to wash their hands of this crisis they created, and if that takes legislative action at the state or federal level, we will be ready to act.\"\n\n\"As we continue to confront this crisis, I'm grateful to Governor Healey, Lieutenant Governor Driscoll, and Secretary Walsh who have worked tirelessly to prepare for this moment.

Steward was Medical Properties' largest tenant, at one point accounting for roughly 20% of its revenue.\n\nIn late March, Medical Properties' stock jumped on the news that Steward would be selling off its managed care business to give it a liquidity injection to potentially stave off the inevitable. However, it appears the delay in being able to close the deal, and perhaps a distressed price for the sale, didn't allow Steward to save itself in time. In a statement, the private owner of 30 hospitals pointed to higher costs and lower government reimbursement as reasons for the bankruptcy filing.\n\nAs part of the deal, Medical Properties said it will provide a $75 million debtor-in-possession (DIP) loan, and an additional loan of up to $225 million in order to fund operations and keep Steward's hospitals open. And these will be on top of the $60 million bridge loan and rent deferrals Medical Properties lent Steward back in January.\n\nMedical Properties investors may not have expected the company to lend Steward additional money, but rather seize Steward's assets and sell them off. On its fourth-quarter earnings release, the company said, \"With regard to Steward, we are encouraged by the amount of interest received to date from other hospital operators for these mission-critical facilities, and we expect this real estate portfolio will either resume its contributions to earnings or become additional sources of liquidity as the year progresses.\"\n\nWhile the interim DIP loan may just be a temporary measure before a sale, it's still an unwelcome development.\n\nSome may be tempted to bargain-hunt in Medical Properties, as the stock is now yielding 13.3% even at the reduced dividend the company cut last year.\n\nHowever, while Medical Properties could sell off Steward's assets and turn itself around, there is really a lot of uncertainty here. Medical Properties is also selling off other assets besides Steward as it attempts to de-lever amid higher interest rates. Furthermore, as Steward's problems have highlighted, the costs to run hospitals and less help from government reimbursements are problems other medical facilities could face as well.

"title": "Steward CEO tells employees bankruptcy filing will not have 'negative impact'", "body": "Steward Health Care CEO Ralph de la Torre on Monday, the same day the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, sought to reassure employees that the bankruptcy filing was simply a way for the company to restructure its finances and would not impact its ability to continue operating the hospitals it owns, eight of which are in Massachusetts.\n\nIn a message sent to employees obtained by The Boston Globe, de la Torre blamed the financial troubles the company has faced on \"chronic government payor under-reimbursement rates, marked increases in Medicaid and behavioral health and unprecedented increases in free care.\"\n\nThose factors, along with increasing labor costs, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and inflation left the company in the financial position it now faces, he wrote.\n\nde la Torre also confirmed that each of the hospitals owned by Steward will remain open as bankruptcy proceedings play out.\n\n\"It is incumbent on all of us to ensure that this process has no impact on the quality care our patients, their families, and our communities can continue to receive care at our hospitals,\" he wrote, adding the bankruptcy process \"should not negatively impact our ability to operate and provide high-quality care to the communities we serve.\"\n\nThe company has been the subject of intense scrutiny from state and federal officials in Massachusetts as more information came to light about its precarious financial position, which includes tens of millions of dollars in debt, MassLive reported.\n\nOn Friday, the state activated an \"emergency operations plan\" to ensure patients had continued access to the hospital system.\n\nAs part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Steward is finalizing the terms of a $75 million debtor-in-possession financing agreement with Medical Properties Trust, its de-facto landlord, that could provide the company an additional $225 million \"upon the satisfaction of certain conditions acceptable to Medical Properties Trust.\"\n\nDebtor-in-possession financing is only available to companies in bankruptcy, and serves as a lifeline for companies in financial distress, according to Corporate Finance Institute.\n\nIn March, Steward announced that it planned to sell its network of doctors to a wing of the for-profit UnitedHealth Group for an undisclosed sum, WBUR reported at the time.\n\nAnd in April, the company followed through on its planned shuttering of New England Sinai Hospital in Stoughton, a move that resulted in the loss of 39 rehabilitation service beds, 119 chronic care beds, and all ambulatory care at the hospital, according to a filing the struggling health care company made with state regulators in January.\n\nThe court-supervised bankruptcy process will leave Steward \"better positioned to responsibly transition ownership of its Massachusetts-based hospitals, keep all of its hospitals open to treat patients, and ensure the continued care and service of our patients and our communities.\"", "source": {"uri": "masslive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MassLive"},

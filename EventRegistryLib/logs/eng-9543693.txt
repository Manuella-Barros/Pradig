When faced with limited income and increased expenses, individuals often rely on credit cards to cover basic living costs.\n\nUnfortunately, this reliance can lead to higher card balances, increased interest charges, and difficulty making minimum payments. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York attests to this trend, with credit card balances reaching a record-high of $1.08 trillion as of 2023. That's a $154 billion year-over-year gain in debt, which is the largest increase since the start of its series in 1999.\n\nAs credit card debt accumulates, it becomes a vicious cycle that is challenging to break free from. The burden of financial strain can seem overwhelming, causing individuals to feel trapped in a never-ending cycle of debt. Thus, as BestCards reports, it is crucial to address the impact of financial hardships on credit card debt and seek effective strategies to manage and reduce this burden.\n\nImportance of Managing Credit Card Debt During Tough Economic Times\n\nManaging credit card debt is especially crucial during tough economic times. It becomes even more important to take proactive measures to prevent the accumulation of additional debt and protect your financial well-being. By effectively managing your credit card debt, you can alleviate the burden of financial strain and regain control over your finances. This will enable you to navigate these tough times more confidently and comfortably.\n\nSteps for Managing Credit Card Debt\n\nHere are practical steps you can take to better get control of your finances:\n\nAssess Your Current Financial Situation\n\nAssessing your current financial situation is crucial before implementing strategies to manage credit card debt. Take stock of your income, expenses, and outstanding credit card balances. This evaluation will help you understand your financial standing and guide your debt management decisions.\n\nCreate a Budget and Cutting Expenses\n\nOne of the first steps in managing credit card debt is to create a budget and cut unnecessary expenses. Start by listing all your monthly income sources and fixed expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments and utilities. Then, identify areas where you can reduce discretionary spending, such as dining out, entertainment, or non-essential subscriptions. Sticking to a budget and cutting expenses can free up more money to pay off your credit card debt.\n\nPrioritize Debt Repayment\n\nWhen facing credit card debt, it is crucial to prioritize your debt repayment. Start by making at least the minimum payments on all your credit cards to avoid late fees and penalties. Then, focus on paying off the credit card with the highest interest rate first while making minimum payments on other cards. This strategy, known as the debt avalanche method, helps save money on interest payments and accelerates your journey toward debt freedom.\n\nNegotiate with Credit Card Companies\n\nBelieve it or not, credit card companies may allow you to negotiate your existing debt. This is because most credit card debt is unsecured, so the lender should work with you to collect some of your balance rather than risk no repayment in bankruptcy.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact your credit card companies to discuss better terms. Credit card companies may be more willing to find a mutually beneficial solution during tough economic times. They might consider reducing interest rates, extending payment deadlines, or offering hardship programs.\n\nNegotiating with your credit card companies can help lower your monthly payments and make debt repayment more manageable.\n\nExplore Debt Consolidation Options\n\nIf you have multiple credit cards with high-interest rates, consolidating your debt is a viable option. Debt consolidation involves combining all your credit card debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate. This approach simplifies your debt repayment process and can save you money on interest charges. However, it is crucial to research and compare different consolidation options to ensure you choose the one that best fits your financial situation.\n\nSeek Professional Help for Credit Card Debt Management\n\nIf managing credit card debt becomes overwhelming, seeking professional help can provide valuable guidance. Regarding credit counseling, think of it as having a therapist for your financial habits. Here's how credit counseling can benefit you:\n\nIn essence, credit counselors provide the guidance and support you need to move toward a healthier credit situation, empowering you to take the necessary steps to improve your financial well-being.\n\nCredit counseling agencies and debt management companies specialize in helping individuals navigate their way out of debt. They can assist in creating a personalized debt management plan, negotiating with credit card companies, and providing financial education. Before engaging with any professional service, research reputable organizations and ensure they have a track record of helping people successfully manage their credit card debt.\n\nTips for Staying Motivated and Accountable\n\nManaging credit card debt requires discipline and perseverance. Here are some tips to help you stay motivated and accountable throughout your debt repayment journey:\n\nCoping Strategies for Managing Debt During Unexpected Financial Hardships\n\nUnexpected financial hardships can significantly impact your ability to manage credit card debt. Here are some coping strategies to help you navigate through tough times:\n\nLong-term Strategies for Avoiding Credit Card Debt in the Future\n\nWhile managing credit card debt during tough economic times is essential, it is equally crucial to develop long-term strategies to avoid falling into debt in the future. Here are some tips to help you maintain a debt-free lifestyle:\n\nExpert Advice\n\nAccording to personal finance guru Tiffany Aliche, or The Budgetnista, it is important to allow flexibility during challenging financial times. She states, \"Normally, I prioritize aggressively paying down debt, as well as saving and investing. However, during particularly difficult financial times, I encourage people to give themselves some grace. Your emergency savings should be your first line of defense, and you should aim to have enough saved to cover at least three months or more. If you don't have that amount saved, then that should be your focus. Once your emergency fund is established, you can resume paying down debt.\"\n\nThis approach of allowing for grace does not contradict her general belief that paying down debt and maintaining a low credit utilization is crucial for improving a damaged credit score. She says, \"So nothing has really changed; it's the same advice. I understand that it may not always be feasible, but if possible, that's what you should prioritize.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging credit card debt during tough economic times is difficult, but not impossible. By understanding credit card debt, assessing your financial situation, and implementing practical strategies, you can weather the storm and regain control over your finances. Remember, seeking professional help and staying motivated are essential components of successfully managing credit card debt. With determination and discipline, you can overcome financial hardships and build a brighter financial future for yourself.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_counseling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Credit counseling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve Bank of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_consolidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Debt consolidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit score"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal finance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Credit_and_Collection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Credit and Collection", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Financial_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Financial Planning", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 60}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Sports", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/fg1rqq/picture288357345/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/aa681d77-1e3f-4d50-8b31-988b6300f119", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543693", "eventUri": "eng-9543693", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

After all, if you're carrying a credit card balance (or two) from month to month, just one minor hardship, whether it's a job loss, medical issue or emergency home repair, can lead to serious debt issues that are hard to overcome.\n\nAnd, the reality is that anyone can get in over their head with credit card debt in today's high interest rate environment, even without the extra hardships. That's because, following a series of Federal Reserve rate hikes, credit card rates are now hovering above 21% on average. And, with credit card interest rates that high, all it takes is a few months of a high balance for the interest charges to compound, making it tough to pay off what you owe.\n\nIf you're currently grappling with unmanageable credit card balances, one potential solution is to try negotiating with your creditors for debt settlement, also known as debt forgiveness. When you opt for credit card debt forgiveness, you negotiate with your creditors, either through a debt relief company or on your own, to settle your debts for less than the full amount owed. But while debt settlement can be a lifeline for borrowers who are in financial trouble, there are some things you should avoid if you're trying to take this route.\n\nFind out what your credit card debt relief options are online now.\n\nIf you want to settle your credit card debt for less than what you owe, take note of the following:\n\nThe first and most crucial thing to avoid when looking for credit card debt forgiveness is taking on new debt. If you want to settle your credit card debt, stop using all of your credit cards entirely. Even a single new charge can derail your efforts in the creditors' eyes. They need to see that the cycle of creating new debt has been broken before they'll consider decreasing or writing off your existing balances. The temptation to use your cards will be there when cash is tight, but using credit will signal that you can't control your spending habits.\n\nExplore the many benefits that the right debt relief company can offer you here.\n\nWhen pursuing debt settlement, you'll need to demonstrate a true inability to pay your full credit card balances over time through your current income. So, don't lie or fudge the numbers on your income, assets and expenses to try and qualify. If you're working with a debt settlement company, provide them with complete access to all your income sources, debts, expenses and assets right from the start instead. Any omissions you make early in the process could later be grounds for your creditors to claim you attempted fraud and reject settlements.\n\nWhen you have credit card debt across multiple cards, avoid the temptation to try and settle one account at a time in a piecemeal approach to debt forgiveness. The debt relief company and your creditors will want total transparency into your overall unsecured debt exposure across all credit cards and accounts. Present them with a complete accounting of what you owe and stick to negotiating it all together rather than leaving certain accounts out.\n\nYou might think it makes sense to consolidate your credit card balances onto a new debt consolidation loan. However, in the creditors' eyes, this simply represents exchanging one debt for another, and loan obligations are viewed differently than credit card balances when it comes to debt settlement. And, by paying off plastic with another form of debt, you greatly reduce your odds of getting the credit card companies to agree to a reduced payoff.\n\nUsing funds from retirement accounts, home equity loans or other assets to pay off credit card debt will also show creditors that you have a remaining ability to pay that disqualifies you from settlement. In turn, any path to pay the full debts from other means can torpedo the debt forgiveness opportunity.\n\nThe debt settlement process can be tedious and slow-moving. It can often take meticulous budgeting, document submission and back-and-forth negotiation before your creditors approve a settlement. You'll need perseverance and stamina throughout all the hoops you're made to jump through. So, don't get discouraged and give up halfway through, or you'll have wasted all your efforts only to remain stuck at the beginning.\n\nWhile you have the option to try and negotiate credit card debt settlement on your own, it can be difficult to do. Most people are better off hiring a reputable debt settlement firm that has established negotiating processes to go to bat on their behalf. Either way, though, following the strict rules and requirements is mandatory if you want any chance at qualifying for a drastically reduced debt burden.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_settlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Debt settlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Debt relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creditor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Write-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_consolidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt consolidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accounting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retirement"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/05/06/eb93a9de-6324-4125-b364-b63ed1d638d6/thumbnail/1200x630/0135daed7b1aed09cb4ed471ab52810c/gettyimages-112295325.jpg?v=1d6c78a71b7b6252b543a329b3a5744d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543693", "eventUri": "eng-9543693", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Scholaroo, a national firm matching college students with potential scholarships, surveyed more than 2,000 people across the United States during the final quarter of 2023.\n\nComing in at a close second is Connecticut, with an average debt of $8,011 per credit card, followed by Maryland, New York, and Alaska -- all with debt over $7,600 per card. Rounding up the top 10 states are Colorado, California, Massachusetts, Florida, and Hawaii, all with average credit card debts of in excess of $7,400.\n\n\"New Jersey residents' debt surpasses the national average by 24 percent, while Mississippi has the lowest average credit card debt, with debtors owing just $5,186 -- 20 percent less than the national average,\" the report states. Kentucky and Indiana also fell on the lower side with an average of $5,295.\n\nBruce McClary, senior vice president, Membership & Media Relations for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC), told The Epoch Times that amount of debt is not surprising as many people are forced to use their credit cards just to stay afloat. \"Things are so much more expensive than they were three years ago,\" he said. \"The runaway inflation is affecting grocery prices, and we've seen a roller-coaster ride for gasoline prices. Many people don't have the money in their budgets for these added expenses and so they're using credit cards and making minimum payments each month.\"\n\nBased in Washington, D.C, the NFCC was founded in 1998 as a nonprofit credit-counseling source for people who need help in managing their debts. Its recently released Harris poll also surveyed 2,000 adults nationwide and found similar outstanding debt dollars. But the overall results were even more surprising: nearly 32 percent of Americans are just getting by financially, while 62 percent fear that government instability will hurt their finances in the next 12 months.\n\n\"The biggest concern is that if people continue to carry that much debt from month to month, making only the minimum payments required, it could take years to pay it off, and they'll find it extremely difficult to save any money,\" added Mr. McClary.\n\nThe Harris poll also indicated that 31 percent of American's don't pay all their bills on time, and only 42 percent have a budget and keep track of spending. Almost 40 percent of those surveyed are concerned that the money they have or will save just won't last.\n\nThe poll found that the most affected groups are people who are single, rent instead of own, are parents of children under 18, and have incomes of $50,000 or less. \"Today's higher rents may also be responsible for this credit card debt situation,\" Mr. McClary explained. \"Most are paying way more than the recommended percent of their income toward rent, so now they're faced with managing the rest of their expenses like groceries, utilities, gas, medical bills, and more. They're finding they have to rely on the credit cards to help make ends meet.\"\n\nAs a result, many have already been priced out of the ever-skyrocketing housing market. \"Ten years ago, Seattle was one of those cities considered to be affordable, but there's been such a tremendous increase in rents there that many people are no longer able to afford buying or even renting there,\" said Mr. McClary.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) Consumer Advice Department recommends that those having difficulty making even the minimum monthly credit card payments first talk with the company to ask for their help. \"Your goal is to work out a modified payment plan that lowers your payments to a level you can manage,\" the FTC's website states. \"Creditors may be willing to negotiate with you even after they write your debt off as a loss, as you will still owe that debt.\"\n\nThe NFCC also provides renegotiation services with credit card companies to reduce the monthly interest rates, which can sometimes be as high as 20 percent. \"What we try to do is help people regain control of their unmanageable debt by looking at their income and financial obligations and work out a livable budget,\" said Mr. McClary. \"It's like a tire finally getting some traction after spinning in the mud for so long.\"\n\nIn the meantime, there seems to be no slowdown for America's love of credit cards. According to the Scholaroo report, last year, almost 45.5 percent of the American population opened at least one new credit card account, resulting in some 542.6 million new accounts by the end of 2023. While over 50 percent of Americans prefer using debit cards for their day-to-day expenses, the credit card stands as the second most favored choice, with 36 percent of the population using it for their daily transactions.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We've picked the best credit cards in a way designed to be the most helpful to the widest variety of readers.\n\nThe amount of debt you already owe is a factor in every mortgage application. Lenders use this to calculate your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Essentially, this number estimates your ability to repay the money you borrow: If the ratio is too high, the lender may think you're borrowing more than you can afford. This may lead to a disconnect between the amount you're requesting and the mortgage amount you're approved for (if you're approved at all).\n\nAny and all debts in your name factor into your DTI calculation, including but not limited to housing payments, car payments, student loan payments and credit card debt. Only your minimum monthly credit card payment is used in the calculation. Of course, higher total credit card balances will result in higher minimum payments.\n\nThe exact amount of acceptable debt will vary by each loan issuer, but a common cut-off threshold is 43%. On a $100,000 annual income ($8,333 per month before taxes and other deductions), that would mean your total debts including your intended housing payment are no more than $3,583 monthly. Some loan issuers may set their limits at higher or lower amounts.\n\nTo lower your debt-to-income ratio and improve your odds of approval, you'll need to pay down your existing debts before applying. While any type of debt paydown will have the same effect on your overall DTI, credit card debt is often the best one to focus on due to the double-digit interest rates that increase your balance exponentially.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt-to-income_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debt-to-income ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Stationery", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Trading Cards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading_Cards", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Trading Cards", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.forbes.com/advisor/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/How-Do-Credit-Cards-Impact-Your-Mortgage-Application-cc-FI.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543693", "eventUri": "eng-9543693", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

We're making these changes to give you greater flexibility over how much you pay each month.\"\n\nAround 80% of those who bank with Barclays will see their minimum monthly repayments decrease.\n\nHowever, Martin Lewis has warned the public that this isn't as good as it may first seem.\n\n\"Minimum repayments have always been credit card firms' secret weapon. Letting people repay little looks appealing - hence why Barclaycard says this is about 'flexibility'. Yet it takes flexibility to kick your own backside, and this will hurt some just as much,\" he said, via The Independent.\n\n\"Barclaycard's reduction, for many, from 3.75% of the balance to 1% of the balance - means while people's repayments will cover their interest, they will clear far less of what they owe, prolonging the debt, keeping people indebted year after year after year, and the interest racking up year after year after year.\"\n\nLewis' website, MoneySavingExpert.com, calculated that, with a Platinum card interest rate and \u00a31000 of debt, it could take nearly 20 years and \u00a31,655 of interest to pay off the debt if paying the new minimum.\n\nBefore the changes, this would have taken just under ten years with \u00a3699 being paid in interest.\n\n\"I would urge all Barclaycard customers to sit up, take note of this, and check now if you only pay the minimums,\" Lewis said.\n\n\"If so, unless you've other, even costlier debt you're clearing first, if you can't afford to repay in full each month, try to make a fixed monthly repayment based on what you can afford - even if it's the same amount as your current minimum - rather than letting your repayments decrease as you owe less.\n\n\"This can radically reduce the length you're in debt and the interest cost. The more you can repay, the less interest you'll be charged.\"\n\nA Barclays spokesperson said of the new system: \"We regularly review our products and from July, some Barclaycard customers will see changes to their minimum monthly payments, alongside adjustments to the APR.\n\n\"Customers will benefit from a reduction in their minimum monthly repayment and the vast majority have no change to APR, while some will receive a decrease.\"\n\nRelated links:\n\nMartin Lewis delivers 'don't do it' warning to drivers and says 'it's fraud'\n\nMartin Lewis fan wakes up to \u00a335k in bank account after following his advice", "source": {"uri": "joe.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "JOE.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nina_mclaughlin@joe.co.uk", "name": "Nina McLaughlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lewis (financial journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclaycard", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barclaycard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoneySavingExpert.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MoneySavingExpert.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Annual percentage rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://dus09vr7ngt46.cloudfront.net/uploads/2024/04/collage3-13.png?height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543693", "eventUri": "eng-9543693", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

When faced with limited income and increased expenses, individuals often rely on credit cards to cover basic living costs.\n\nUnfortunately, this reliance can lead to higher card balances, increased interest charges, and difficulty making minimum payments. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York attests to this trend, with credit card balances reaching a record-high of $1.08 trillion as of 2023. That's a $154 billion year-over-year gain in debt, which is the largest increase since the start of its series in 1999.\n\nAs credit card debt accumulates, it becomes a vicious cycle that is challenging to break free from. The burden of financial strain can seem overwhelming, causing individuals to feel trapped in a never-ending cycle of debt. Thus, as BestCards reports, it is crucial to address the impact of financial hardships on credit card debt and seek effective strategies to manage and reduce this burden.\n\nImportance of Managing Credit Card Debt During Tough Economic Times\n\nManaging credit card debt is especially crucial during tough economic times. It becomes even more important to take proactive measures to prevent the accumulation of additional debt and protect your financial well-being. By effectively managing your credit card debt, you can alleviate the burden of financial strain and regain control over your finances. This will enable you to navigate these tough times more confidently and comfortably.\n\nSteps for Managing Credit Card Debt\n\nHere are practical steps you can take to better get control of your finances:\n\nAssess Your Current Financial Situation\n\nAssessing your current financial situation is crucial before implementing strategies to manage credit card debt. Take stock of your income, expenses, and outstanding credit card balances. This evaluation will help you understand your financial standing and guide your debt management decisions.\n\nCreate a Budget and Cutting Expenses\n\nOne of the first steps in managing credit card debt is to create a budget and cut unnecessary expenses. Start by listing all your monthly income sources and fixed expenses, such as rent or mortgage payments and utilities. Then, identify areas where you can reduce discretionary spending, such as dining out, entertainment, or non-essential subscriptions. Sticking to a budget and cutting expenses can free up more money to pay off your credit card debt.\n\nPrioritize Debt Repayment\n\nWhen facing credit card debt, it is crucial to prioritize your debt repayment. Start by making at least the minimum payments on all your credit cards to avoid late fees and penalties. Then, focus on paying off the credit card with the highest interest rate first while making minimum payments on other cards. This strategy, known as the debt avalanche method, helps save money on interest payments and accelerates your journey toward debt freedom.\n\nNegotiate with Credit Card Companies\n\nBelieve it or not, credit card companies may allow you to negotiate your existing debt. This is because most credit card debt is unsecured, so the lender should work with you to collect some of your balance rather than risk no repayment in bankruptcy.\n\nDon't hesitate to contact your credit card companies to discuss better terms. Credit card companies may be more willing to find a mutually beneficial solution during tough economic times. They might consider reducing interest rates, extending payment deadlines, or offering hardship programs.\n\nNegotiating with your credit card companies can help lower your monthly payments and make debt repayment more manageable.\n\nExplore Debt Consolidation Options\n\nIf you have multiple credit cards with high-interest rates, consolidating your debt is a viable option. Debt consolidation involves combining all your credit card debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate. This approach simplifies your debt repayment process and can save you money on interest charges. However, it is crucial to research and compare different consolidation options to ensure you choose the one that best fits your financial situation.\n\nSeek Professional Help for Credit Card Debt Management\n\nIf managing credit card debt becomes overwhelming, seeking professional help can provide valuable guidance. Regarding credit counseling, think of it as having a therapist for your financial habits. Here's how credit counseling can benefit you:\n\nIn essence, credit counselors provide the guidance and support you need to move toward a healthier credit situation, empowering you to take the necessary steps to improve your financial well-being.\n\nCredit counseling agencies and debt management companies specialize in helping individuals navigate their way out of debt. They can assist in creating a personalized debt management plan, negotiating with credit card companies, and providing financial education. Before engaging with any professional service, research reputable organizations and ensure they have a track record of helping people successfully manage their credit card debt.\n\nTips for Staying Motivated and Accountable\n\nManaging credit card debt requires discipline and perseverance. Here are some tips to help you stay motivated and accountable throughout your debt repayment journey:\n\nCoping Strategies for Managing Debt During Unexpected Financial Hardships\n\nUnexpected financial hardships can significantly impact your ability to manage credit card debt. Here are some coping strategies to help you navigate through tough times:\n\nLong-term Strategies for Avoiding Credit Card Debt in the Future\n\nWhile managing credit card debt during tough economic times is essential, it is equally crucial to develop long-term strategies to avoid falling into debt in the future. Here are some tips to help you maintain a debt-free lifestyle:\n\nExpert Advice\n\nAccording to personal finance guru Tiffany Aliche, or The Budgetnista, it is important to allow flexibility during challenging financial times. She states, \"Normally, I prioritize aggressively paying down debt, as well as saving and investing. However, during particularly difficult financial times, I encourage people to give themselves some grace. Your emergency savings should be your first line of defense, and you should aim to have enough saved to cover at least three months or more. If you don't have that amount saved, then that should be your focus. Once your emergency fund is established, you can resume paying down debt.\"\n\nThis approach of allowing for grace does not contradict her general belief that paying down debt and maintaining a low credit utilization is crucial for improving a damaged credit score. She says, \"So nothing has really changed; it's the same advice. I understand that it may not always be feasible, but if possible, that's what you should prioritize.\"\n\nConclusion\n\nManaging credit card debt during tough economic times is difficult, but not impossible. By understanding credit card debt, assessing your financial situation, and implementing practical strategies, you can weather the storm and regain control over your finances. Remember, seeking professional help and staying motivated are essential components of successfully managing credit card debt.

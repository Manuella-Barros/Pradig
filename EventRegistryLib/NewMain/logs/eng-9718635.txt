responding to Mr Blythyn's comments through the media and any questions raised will be dealt with directly.\n\nSpeaking after Ms Blythyn made her statement, Andrew RT Davies MS, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"Hannah Blythyn's comments raise more questions for the First Minister.\n\n\"People will now rightly ask whether the First Minister publicly sacked Hannah without sufficient evidence that she was guilty of leaking.\n\n\"The personal consequences for Hannah of that sacking were clearly enormous, and the First Minister owes her a full and humble apology.\"\n\nThe First Minister's decision to sack Ms Blythyn followed a report on the Nation.Cymru news website which featured a message posted to a ministerial group chat in August 2020 by Mr Gething, stating that he was \"deleting the messages in this group\".\n\nHe said the leaked message was from a section of an iMessage group chat with other Labour ministers and related to internal discussions within the Senedd Labour group.\n\nMr Gething previously told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry that lost WhatsApp messages were not deleted by him, but by the Welsh Parliament's IT team during a security rebuild.\n\nHe denied the leaked message contradicted the evidence he had given to the inquiry, adding that it did not relate to pandemic decision-making but \"comments that colleagues make to and about each other\".\n\nThe First Minister has refused to show evidence for Ms Blythyn's sacking when asked for it in the Senedd.\n\nAt the time of her dismissal, Ms Blythyn strongly denied leaking anything and said she was \"deeply shocked\" at her dismissal and said she was \"clear and have been clear that I did not, nor have I ever leaked anything\".", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

First Minister faces second vote of no confidence\n\nGeorge Thompson, PA\n\n10 July 2024 at 8:20 pm\n\nThe First Minister of Wales is set to face another vote of no confidence, a month after losing the last one.\n\nThe Welsh Conservatives have tabled a motion in the Senedd for next week, in the hopes of compelling Vaughan Gething, the Labour leader of Wales, to publish the evidence he used to sack Hannah Blythyn from the government.\n\nThis is the second time the First Minister has faced a no confidence vote since becoming leader in March.\n\nMr Blythyn was removed from the government in May, following accusations by Mr Gething that she leaked a screenshot of messages to the media.\n\nThe member of the Senedd for Delyn denied she was behind the leak in a statement to the chamber on Tuesday and insisted she was shown no evidence before her dismissal.\n\nMr Gething told the Welsh Parliament on Wednesday that it was \"clear\" the leak came from Ms Blythyn, \"having crossed check the photograph with a full set of messages\".\n\nThe Conservatives have called the no confidence motion saying Ms Blythyn's statement contradicts the First Minister's claims that there is evidence.\n\nAndrew RT Davies MS, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"Yet again, because he will not provide any answers voluntarily, the First Minister has to be dragged kicking and screaming to the Senedd.\n\n\"The First Minister expects us to take his word for it that he had evidence to sack Hannah Blythyn, but sadly, thanks to his behaviour in office, the people of Wales cannot take his word for it.\n\n\"It's time to get answers, and I hope Members across the Senedd will join us next week in voting for transparency in government.\"\n\nMr Gething told the Senedd on Wednesday he did not intend to release any further information unless everyone involved in the message group was \"content for that to happen\".\n\nOne member, Mike Hedges, said he was content for his name to be unredacted.\n\nThe Tories have said that if their motion passes, Mr Gething may be compelled to release any evidence under the Government of Wales Act 2006, which \"grants the Senedd the power to require the First Minister to produce documents relevant to the exercise of Welsh Ministers' functions\".\n\nMr Gething lost the previous vote in June in part because Ms Blythyn and another Labour MS, Lee Waters, were not present.\n\nMs Blythyn has since revealed she was signed off sick following her removal from government, which led to \"acute anxiety and stress\".\n\nThe Welsh government has

Delyn MS Hannah Blythyn was removed from the Welsh Labour government by Vaughan Gething in May.\n\nIt followed messages from a Covid pandemic-era group chat being leaked to the media. Ms Blythyn denied on social media in May, following her sacking, that she had been the source of the leak.\n\nThis week saw the drama switch to the Senedd. The North Wales MS broke her silence about her dismissal in the Senedd on Tuesday using a personal statement to insist she was innocent. She said that she could \"look all my colleagues who sit on these benches in the eye\" and say she had not leaked to the media.\n\nREAD MORE: The latest Covid figures in Wales as new variants spread in UK and 'Eras Tour hangover' trends\n\nREAD MORE: North Wales restaurant that reached legendary status taken on by Michelin chef\n\nOn Wednesday the embattled First Minister told the Senedd the messages could only have come from the former minister's phone, adding that there had been a \"breach of trust\". But now Nation.Cymru has come out to categorically state Ms Blythyn was not the source of the story. It is unusual for news outlets to make any comment around sources but they said in this \"unprecedented situation\" they could not stand by and \"see Ms Blythyn's reputation unjustly besmirched by the First Minister\".\n\nThey added: \"Given the strong public interest and importance of this story and out of concern for Hannah Blythyn's wellbeing we have decided that the right thing to do is to state publicly that she was not the source of our story and that at no stage before or since publication of it have we had any contact with her about it.\" This will pile the pressure on the First Minister who is now fighting a number of crises after only four months in the job.\n\nHe has come under sustained attack over a series of rows concerning donations he took while running to be Welsh Labour leader. This has been followed by the furore over the decision to sack Ms Blythyn - a move that has seemingly spilt the Labour party in the Senedd. This also led to the collapse of a co-operation agreement between his party and Plaid Cymru and he subsequently lost a non-binding vote of no-confidence in the Senedd. The First Minister has been asked to comment on the latest revelation.\n\nAddressing the Senedd on Wednesday he said: \"It is, of course, vital for the function of government that ministers have trust in each other at all times and that private discussions remain private. For these messages to be provided to a journalist is a breach of that trust.\" He added: \"Having cross-checked the photograph with a full set of messages it became clear that the photograph could only have been of one member's phone.\" Mr Gething added that he would \"rather not go through this detail in public\" but said he had spoken to the member on May 16 setting out his analysis and insisted: \"I had evidence to support the decision.\" Sitting behind Mr Gething, Ms Blythyn could be seen shaking her head as the First Minister spoke.\n\nThe First Minister is now facing a second vote a Senedd motion to be debated next week with the Conservatives hoping to \"compel\" him to publish the evidence he used to sack Ms Blythyn. Mr Gething lost a no-confidence vote in June in part because Ms Blythyn and another Labour MS, Lee Waters, were not present.\n\nSpeaking in the Senedd on Tuesday Ms Blythyn said she had \"formally raised concerns\" about the process by which she was removed from government. She said she was not shown any evidence before her sacking nor was she made aware she was under investigation. Ms Blythyn led a guarded attack on the First Minister, saying a proper process needs to be in place to ensure the \"integrity of the Civil Service and the office of the First Minister\" and said she had enjoyed her time in government under Mr Gething's predecessor Mark Drakeford.\n\nThe First Minister's decision to sack Ms Blythyn followed a report on the Nation.Cymru news website, which featured a message posted to a ministerial group chat in August 2020 by Mr Gething, stating that he was \"deleting the messages in this group\". He said the leaked message was from a section of an iMessage group chat with other Labour ministers and related to internal discussions within the Senedd Labour group.\n\nMr Gething previously told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry that lost WhatsApp messages were not deleted by him but by the Welsh Parliament's IT team during a security rebuild. He denied the leaked message contradicted the evidence he had given to the inquiry, adding that it did not relate to pandemic decision-making but \"comments that colleagues make to and about each other\". The First Minister has not publicly shared any evidence for Ms Blythyn's sacking.\n\nSign up now for the latest news on the NorthWalesLive WhatsApp communityand use this tool to see the news in your area:", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "owen_hughes@dailypost.co.uk", "name": "Owen Hughes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Blythyn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Blythyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delyn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delyn (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation.Cymru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nation.Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plaid Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Covid-19_Inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Covid-19 Inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Waters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Drakeford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Drakeford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Service_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil Service (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email_Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice/Email Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29508643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HB2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718635", "eventUri": "eng-9718635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 2948, "textEnd": 2954}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 4146, "textEnd": 4157}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

First Minister of Wales has insisted it was \"clear\" that a sacked government minister was behind a message leaked to the media, despite her emphatic denials.\n\nHannah Blythyn was removed from the Welsh Labour government by Vaughan Gething in May, following messages from the Covid pandemic being leaked to the media.\n\nMs Blythyn broke her silence about her dismissal in the Senedd on Tuesday, using a personal statement to insist she was innocent, and that she could \"look all my colleagues who sit on these benches in the eye\" and say she had not leaked to the media.\n\nThe embattled First Minister told the Senedd on Wednesday the messages could only have come from the former minister's phone, adding that there had been a \"breach of trust\".\n\nMr Gething has come under sustained attack in recent months for his decision to sack Ms Blythyn and over a series of rows concerning donations he took while running to be Welsh Labour leader.\n\nThis led to the collapse of a co-operation agreement between his party and Plaid Cymru and he subsequently lost a non-binding vote of no-confidence in the Senedd.\n\nAddressing the Senedd on Wednesday, he said: \"It is, of course, vital for the function of government that ministers have trust in each other at all times, and that private discussions remain private.\n\n\"For these messages to be provided to a journalist is a breach of that trust.\"\n\nHe added: \"Having cross-checked the photograph with a full set of messages, it became clear that the photograph could only have been of one member's phone.\"\n\nMr Gething added that he would \"rather not go through this detail in public\" but said he had spoken to the member of May 16 setting out his analysis and insisted \"I had evidence to support the decision.\"\n\nSitting behind Mr Gething, Ms Blythyn could be seen shaking her head as the First Minister spoke.\n\nThe First Minister is now facing a second vote of no-confidence in the Senedd next week, with the Conservatives hoping to \"compel\" him to publish the evidence he used to sack Ms Blythyn.\n\nMr Gething lost the previous vote in June in part because Ms Blythyn and another Labour MS, Lee Waters, were not present.\n\nSpeaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, Ms Blythyn said she had \"formally raised concerns\" about the process by which she was removed from government.\n\nShe said she was not shown any evidence before her sacking, nor was she made aware she was under investigation.\n\nMs Blythyn led a guarded attack on the First Minister, saying a proper process needs to be in place to ensure the \"integrity of the Civil Service and the office of the First Minister\" and said she had enjoyed her time in government under Mr Gething's predecessor, Mark Drakeford.\n\nThe First Minister's decision to sack Ms Blythyn followed a report on the Nation.Cymru news website, which featured a message posted to a ministerial group chat in August 2020 by Mr Gething, stating that he was \"deleting the messages in this group\".\n\nHe said the leaked message was from a section of an iMessage group chat with other Labour ministers and related to internal discussions within the Senedd Labour group.\n\nMr Gething previously told the UK Covid-19 Inquiry that lost WhatsApp messages were not deleted by him, but by the Welsh Parliament's IT team during a security rebuild.\n\nHe denied the leaked message contradicted the evidence he had given to the inquiry, adding that it did not relate to pandemic decision-making but \"comments that colleagues make to and about each other\".\n\nThe First Minister has not shown any evidence for Ms Blythyn's sacking.\n\nAt the time of her dismissal, Ms Blythyn strongly denied leaking anything and said she was \"deeply shocked\" at her dismissal and said she was \"clear and have been clear that I did not, nor have I ever leaked anything\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

He said: \"Having cross-checked the photograph with a full set of messages, it became clear that the photograph could only have been of one member's phone.\"\n\nMr Gething added that he would \"rather not go through this detail in public\".\n\nMs Blythyn, who sat behind Mr Gething, shook her head as Mr Gething spoke and mouthed 'No' at fellow Senedd members.\n\nMr Gething said he previously told his cabinet that if the person responsible for the photo was identified, they could not stay in government.\n\nOnce it became clear the leak could only have come from \"one person\", the First Minister said he had to take action.\n\n\"Once I was in possession of evidence that amounts to a breach of the ministerial code I had to take the difficult decision whether the member could stay in the government. That decision is mine and mine alone as First Minister\".\n\nMr Gething said he made clear in cabinet and in a Labour meeting that if he could identify who was responsible for the photograph they would not stay in cabinet.\n\nHe reiterated that he could not allow Ms Blythyn to remain in the government, and when referring to his decision, said: \"I believed then and believe now it was the right one\".\n\nMembers of opposition parties challenged the First Minister's statement with leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies calling the incident an \"unfortunate episode\".\n\nHe also expressed that the chamber \"deserves the respect\" to see the evidence Mr Gething based his decision on.\n\nSpeaking at the chamber yesterday (9 July), Ms Blythyn claimed she had not been shown any evidence before her dismissal.\n\nMr Gething said he intended to go through the evidence he had in a planned face to face meeting but \"that was not possible\".\n\n\"The evidence was and is straight forward. An offer has been made again to provide it to the member.\"\n\nHe added: \"A redacted version is already in the public domain, I don't intend to publish any more information\".\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth also addressed the Senedd saying he understands how the First Minister decided to dismiss Ms Blythyn but remains \"unconvinced\" the evidence he had was strong enough to sack his minister.\n\nHe continued: \"We essentially have two fundamentally different versions of the same event.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm not in a position to be able to take sides but we need to be clear we have all the evidence in the public domain to allow the Welsh public to come to a decision of their own\".\n\nThe controversy is set to return to the Senedd next week. The conservatives have tabled a motion demanding the First Minister publishes the evidence and there is a strong chance that the motion could pass if Ms Blythyn abstains.\n\nAlthough not binding to the First Minister, it would increase the political pressure he faces.\n\nThe First Minister's decision to sack Ms Blythyn followed a report on the Nation.Cymru news website which featured a message

"body": "The First Minister of Wales is set to face another crunch vote, a month after losing a motion of no-confidence.\n\nThe Welsh Conservatives have tabled a motion in the Senedd for next week, in the hopes of compelling Vaughan Gething, the Labour leader of Wales, to publish the evidence he used to sack Hannah Blythyn from the government.\n\nThis is the second major vote the First Minister has faced since becoming leader in March.\n\nThe member of the Senedd for Delyn denied she was behind the leak in a statement to the chamber on Tuesday and insisted she was shown no evidence before her dismissal.\n\nMr Gething told the Welsh Parliament on Wednesday that it was \"clear\" the leak came from Ms Blythyn, \"having crossed check the photograph with a full set of messages\".\n\nThe Conservatives have called for the motion saying Ms Blythyn's statement contradicts the First Minister's claims that there is evidence.\n\nAndrew RT Davies MS, leader of the Welsh Conservatives, said: \"Yet again, because he will not provide any answers voluntarily, the First Minister has to be dragged kicking and screaming to the Senedd.\n\n\"The First Minister expects us to take his word for it that he had evidence to sack Hannah Blythyn, but sadly, thanks to his behaviour in office, the people of Wales cannot take his word for it.\n\nMr Gething told the Senedd on Wednesday he did not intend to release any further information unless everyone involved in the message group was \"content for that to happen\".\n\nOne member, Mike Hedges, said he was content for his name to be unredacted.\n\nThe Tories have said that if their motion passes, Mr Gething may be compelled to release any evidence under the Government of Wales Act 2006, which \"grants the Senedd the power to require the First Minister to produce documents relevant to the exercise of Welsh Ministers' functions\".\n\nMr Gething lost the previous vote in June in part because Ms Blythyn and another Labour MS, Lee Waters, were not present.\n\nMs Blythyn has since revealed she was signed off sick following her removal from government, which led to \"acute anxiety and stress\".\n\nThe Welsh Government has been contacted for comment.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd",

and respect of individuals but also to uphold the integrity of the civil service and the office of first minister.\n\n\"I want to take a moment to reflect on something that is very personal and somewhat difficult for me but I feel it's important to say for the sake of how we do politics.\n\n\"I know there has been speculation about my circumstances and whether I have been well enough to work.\n\n\"This has ranged from tantamount to misinformation and what can be put down to misunderstanding.\"\n\n'Detrimental'\n\nMs Blythyn told the chamber the past few months have taken a toll on her mental health as she called for a kinder politics.\n\nShe said: \"It should not be surprising that what happened has been hugely detrimental to me on a personal level and led to acute anxiety and stress.\n\n\"I have never been signed off work before .... there was a point when the thought of putting my camera on to vote and seeing you all literally took my breath away.\n\n\"I share this now not in search of sympathy, I don't want people's sympathy, but because my recent experience has brought home to me that while we all 'talk the talk' on mental health, there is still more to do to improve our understanding and the impact that it has on individuals and their ability to do things we would ordinarily take for granted.\n\n\"Sadly, I think sometimes we get so caught up in the politics that we don't always think about the person.\"\n\n'Integrity is all'\n\nImmediately following her sacking, Ms Blythyn wrote on social media: \"I am deeply shocked and saddened by what has happened.\n\n\"I am clear and have been clear that I did not, nor have I ever leaked anything.\n\n\"Integrity is all in politics and I retain mine.\"\n\nIn a statement at the time, the first minister said: \"It is of vital importance we are able to maintain confidence among government colleagues, so we work as one to focus on improving the lives of the people in Wales.\"\n\nMr Gething kept the door open for his Labour colleague to return to government in future, praising her work on fire services and Wales' LGBTQ+ action plan.\n\n'Misleading'\n\nMartin Shipton, associate editor of Nation.Cymru, penned an article in early May, accusing the first minister of misleading the UK Covid inquiry by not admitting to deleting records.\n\nIn a ministerial group chat in August 2020, Mr Gething, the then-health minister, wrote in the leaked iMessage: \"I'm deleting the messages in this group.\n\n\"They can be captured in an FoI [freedom of information] and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made.\n\nMs Blythyn, a trade unionist from Connah's Quay, supported Mr Gething's opponent Jeremy Miles in the Labour leadership race after Mark Drakeford stood down.\n\nThe left-winger, who has been tipped as a potential future Welsh Labour leader, served as deputy minister for housing, local government and the environment under the former first minister.",

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe former Welsh Government minister sacked by Vaughan Gething has broken her silence by delivering an emotional statement in the Senedd. Hannah Blythyn was sacked as minister for social partnership Hannah Blythyn by Wales' First Minister Vaughan Gething who alleged she had leaked information to the media.\n\nUntil now the Labour Delyn MS had maintained silence except to issue a brief statement on X. On Tuesday she returned to the Senedd chamber for the first time. She denied she had ever leaked or briefed against any of her colleagues and said she had raised formal concerns about the process that led to her removal from government. \"I have formally raised concerns about the process in which I was removed from government including not being shown any alleged evidence before being sacked, not being made aware I was ever investigation, or I was ever advised or told I may have broken the ministerial code,\" she told Senedd colleagues, watched on by her family in the public gallery.\n\nShe made a statement thanking people who sent messages to her during her absence. She said she had not been able to reply to them all but they had \"meant a lot and made a difference\".\n\nREAD MORE: Man falls out of car on busy M4 motorway\n\nREAD MORE: Police issue update after death at recycling plant\n\n\"This is not a statement that is easy for me to make or one I take lightly. There were times in the not too distant past where I was not sure I would, or could, speak in this siambr again. I do so today because I know my removal from government has been a focus of discussion while I have not been here. I also feel a sense of responsibility to those closest to me and my many constituents who have demonstrated great patience, confidence, and understanding in me. Llywydd, I will start by just briefly addressing the circumstances around my leaving government.\n\n\"I know I can look all my colleagues who sit around me on these benches in the eye and say I have never leaked or briefed the media about any of you. In fact I can say that about anyone in the siambr. While I will not share the detail I will share that I have formally raised concerns about the process in which I was removed from government including not being shown any alleged evidence before being sacked, not being made aware that I was ever under investigation, and at no point was it evidenced or I was ever advised I may have broken the ministerial code.\n\n\"I absolutely recognise and respect that it's within the gift of any First Minister to appoint and remove members of their government. I understand the nature of politics and absolutely accept that. I raise concerns not out of self-interest but because I fundamentally believe in devolution and public service. I also have very real concerns that lessons have not been learned from the past. Proper process not only needs to be in place and follow the dignity and respect of individuals involved but also to uphold the integrity of the civil service and the office of the First Minister.\n\n\"I want to take a moment to reflect that's something very personal and difficult for me to say for the sake of how we do politics. I know there's been speculation about my circumstances and whether I have been well enough to work. This has ranged from what is tantamount to misinformation and what was put down to misunderstanding. It should not be surprising that what happened has been hugely detrimental to me on a personal level and led to acute anxiety and stress. I have never been signed off work before and struggled with this in itself before but there was a time that the thought of putting my camera on to vote and seeing you all literally took my breath away.\n\n\"I share this now not in search of sympathy, I don't want people's sympathy, but because my recent experience has brought home that while we talk the talk on mental health there's still more to do to improve our understanding and the impact it has on individuals and their ability to do things we would ordinarily take for granted. Sadly I think we get so caught up in the politics we don't always think about the person. I recently listened to a podcast called Broken Politicians, Broken Politics. I am not broken but I know now more than I did before that I am breakable and we all are. I don't believe politics is broken but it could certainly be better. We've talked about often in this place of a kinder politics but we can't have a kinder politics without kinder people.\n\n\"We won't get better politics without being better people. Our own conduct and character is key to the public having trust in those who serve them and believe politics can be a force for good.\n\n\"Llywydd, it has been a privilege to serve in my country's government particularly under the leadership of Mark Drakeford. The trade union movement not only shaped my values but it helped give me my voice and I am proud to have taken through the most progressive trade union legislation of the devolution era. And the younger me, who struggled with her sexuality, would never ever have believed I would one day spearhead the plan to make Wales the most LGBTQ+-friendly nation in Europe.\n\n\"I am truly grateful for that opportunity and it will always be an absolute privilege to serve the community that shaped me as a member of the Senedd. I am only who I am and where I am because of where I come from. And in spite of the challenges and difficulties, perhaps because of them, I do feel a renewed sense of commitment to the politics of public service and a real determination to contribute to our devolved democracy, my community, and our country.\" While many of her colleagues clapped the First Minister did not.\n\nJoin our WhatsApp news community here for the latest breaking news.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_mosalski@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Mosalski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Blythyn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Blythyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delyn_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delyn (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_motorway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "M4 motorway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywydd_of_the_Senedd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Llywydd of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Drakeford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Drakeford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29508643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HB2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718635", "eventUri": "eng-9718635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

ranged from tantamount to misinformation and what can be put down to misunderstanding.\"\n\nMs Blythyn told the chamber the past few months have taken a toll on her mental health as she called for a

praising her work on fire services and Wales' LGBTQ+ action plan.\n\nMartin Shipton, associate editor of Nation.Cymru, penned an article in early May, accusing the First Minister of misleading the UK Covid inquiry by not admitting to deleting records.\n\nIn a ministerial group chat in August 2020, Mr Gething, the then-health minister, wrote in the leaked iMessage: \"I'm deleting the messages in

This has ranged from what is tantamount to misinformation and what was put down to misunderstanding. It should not be surprising that what happened has been hugely detrimental to me on a personal level and led to acute anxiety and stress. I have never been signed off work before and struggled with this in itself before but there was a time that the thought of putting my camera on to vote and seeing you all literally took my breath away.\n\n\"I share this now not in search of sympathy, I don't want people's sympathy, but because my recent experience has brought home that while we talk the talk on mental health there's still more to do to improve our understanding and the impact it has on individuals and their ability to do things we would ordinarily take for granted. Sadly I think we get so caught up in the politics we don't always think about the person. I recently listened to a podcast called Broken Politicians, Broken Politics.\n\n\"I am not broken but I know now more than I did before that I am breakable and we all are. I don't believe politics is broken but it could certainly be better. We've talked about often in this place of a kinder politics but we can't have a kinder politics without kinder people.\n\n\"We won't get better politics without being better people. Our own conduct and character is key to the public having trust in those who serve them and believe politics can be a force for good.\n\n\"Llywydd, it has been a privilege to serve in my country's government particularly under the leadership of Mark Drakeford. The trade union movement not only shaped my values but it helped give me my voice and I am proud to have taken through the most progressive trade union legislation of the devolution era. And the younger me, who struggled with her sexuality, would never ever have believed I would one day spearhead the plan to make Wales the most LGBTQ+-friendly nation in Europe.\n\n\"I am truly grateful for that opportunity and it will always be an absolute privilege to serve the community that shaped me as a member of the Senedd. I am only who I am and where I am because of where I come from. And in spite of the challenges and difficulties, perhaps because of them, I do feel a renewed sense of commitment to the politics of public service and a real determination to contribute to our devolved democracy, my community, and our country.\"\n\nWhile many of her colleagues clapped the First Minister did not.", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ruth_mosalski@dailypost.co.uk", "name": "Ruth Mosalski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Blythyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Blythyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Wales"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llywydd_of_the_Senedd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Llywydd of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Drakeford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Drakeford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/incoming/article29508643.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_HB2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718635", "eventUri": "eng-9718635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

It is important that whistleblowers can rest assured that their identity will not be disclosed by any news outlet to whom they reveal important matters of public interest. As a rule it follows that we will not enter into public debate about who may have been the source of stories we have published.\n\n\"Events of this week have, however, prompted us to consider carefully the implications of Hannah Blythyn's personal statement to the Senedd on Tuesday and Vaughan Gething's response to it on Wednesday.\n\nUnprecedented\n\nHe added:\"We remain totally committed to protecting our sources. However, in this unprecedented situation, the board of NationCymru does not consider we can stand by and see Ms Blythyn's reputation unjustly besmirched by the First Minister.\n\n\"No one who witnessed Ms Blythyn making her statement in the Senedd could fail to be aware of the immense impact her dismissal as a minister has had on her wellbeing. Her distress has undoubtedly been compounded by the fact that no proper investigation took place before she was dismissed. Instead the First Minister decided to by-pass due process and find her summarily guilty of leaking information to NationCymru.\n\n\"Given the strong public interest and importance of this story and out of concern for Hannah Blythyn's wellbeing, we have decided that the right thing to do is to state publicly that she was not the source of our story and that at no stage before or since publication of it have we had any contact with her about it.\n\n\"We can state unequivocally that Mr Gething is not telling the truth when he suggests that he has incontrovertible evidence that Ms Blythyn was our source.\n\n\"We also think it important to remind everyone that the story we published revealed that Mr Gething, when Health Minister, told ministerial colleagues that he was deleting iMessages from a group chat because they \"could be captured in an FOI\". We believe he has been involved in an attempt to divert attention from the fact that these were Welsh Government iMessages by suggesting that they related to a discussion that had taken place in the Labour Senedd group.\n\n\"If the messages had related to a party meeting of any kind they would not have been susceptible to capture by FOI. As Mr Gething must have known, they could be captured by FoI only because they were 'Welsh Government' iMessages.\n\n\"Similarly, there has been an attempt to suggest that the messages on the screenshot that was passed to us related to no more than banter relating to Mike Hedges, a non-ministerial member of the Senedd Labour group.\n\n\"In fact, Mr Gething's own words in the 'leaked' messages confirm that the discussion related to more than that. He stated: 'Deleting the messages in this group. They can be captured in an FOI and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made'. As we have reported previously, the \"choice being made\" was the decision to base GCSE and A-level results on teachers' assessments because students had been unable to sit exams because of Covid restrictions. There had been uproar about an earlier decision to base results on an algorithm.\n\n\"The fact that the discussion related to a ministerial decision about the handling of Covid meant that the iMessages constituted Welsh Government business. Ministers were already under an obligation to preserve such messages because they were subject to FOI disclosure. Subsequently, they should have been disclosed to the UK Covid Inquiry.\n\n\"Whoever passed us the screenshot was performing a public service. The messages should have been in the public domain anyway.\n\n\"Mr Gething's admission that he was deleting messages conflicts with what he in due course told the Inquiry, which was that messages had been deleted from his mobile phone not by him but when it was being 'refitted' by the Senedd's IT department.\n\n\"Hannah Blythyn has behaved with integrity.

It has been through a really bruising time.\n\nThe supporter said the current crisis is \"worse\" than the situation between Alun Michael and Rhodri Morgan around the turn of the century.\n\n\"There's been leaks and that's caused bad feeling - you have a meeting and a couple of hours later the meeting is reported in the media.\n\n\"We're a new administration trying to get on with things and it is difficult to focus when there's all this stuff going on in the background.\"\n\n\"We're not in a brilliant place politically with some of the things in the Senedd - feedback I've been getting on the doors is that people are cross with us on things like Senedd reform and 20mph,\" the backer added.\n\nBoth claimed that Jeremy Miles could have united the group - something strongly rejected by critics of Mr Gething, who say that none of the situation is the economy minister's fault.\n\nThe second supporter of the supporters said that at \"any moment in time Jeremy could have united the group by saying he supported Vaughan\".\n\n\"If he's going to go in a different direction that's going to tear the group apart.\"\n\nWould Mr Gething fight any potential challenge? Both supporters said he would, although the first backer did suggest that an interim leader could be possible.\n\n\"Everyone's got their limits,\" they said.\n\nThe blame aimed at Jeremy Miles demonstrates the rift that currently exists, and was met with disbelief from those on the other side of the camp.\n\nThe Labour Party observer said the major act Gething-backers think is disloyal is when Mr Miles said he would not have taken the \u00a3200,000 donation.\n\n\"If he had said the opposite it would have been a lie,\" they said, adding it was \"the leader's job to unite the group\".\n\n\"No one forced Vaughan to take the \u00a3200,000. No one forced Vaughan to sack Hannah. No one forced Vaughan to talk down to journalists, or any of this stuff.\"\n\nThey said the concern over the leadership was over having a government \"that can win in two year's time\", rather than simply trying to replace Mr Gething.\n\nThey said \"all the problems that existed before the general election still exist now\". \"Poor political management, lack of government strategy - Vaughan still doesn't think there's anything in his own behaviour that has gone wrong.\"\n\nThey doubted Mr Miles would start a challenge himself. Their \"gut feeling\", though, was that nothing would happen, doubting the appetite of Labour Senedd members to move against the first minister.\n\n\"It would take the group having to be brave and doing difficult things,\" they said.\n\nAnother Labour figure claimed that the first minister was \"being advised by a small group of people who see his survival as a litmus test of what Labour is\".\n\nThe Labour figure expressed concerns over the next election: \"He simply cannot face the electorate in two year's time. We would be sacrificing the party on one man's wishes.\"\n\n\"No one is enjoying this,\" they said. \"No one wants to sharpen a knife.\"\n\nThe Labour group in the Senedd does not have the kind of system of rules that exist in the Conservative Party that would allow Senedd members to remove their leader.\n\n\"As a consequence\", the Labour figure said, \"there isn't an easy exit\".", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaid_Cymru", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plaid Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_of_no_confidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion of no confidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Cymru_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC Cymru Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Miles", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Miles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Democrats_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Democrats (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westminster"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reform UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Dodds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jane Dodds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Liberal_Democrats", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Liberal Democrats"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea_West_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swansea West (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alun_Michael", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alun Michael"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodri_Morgan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhodri Morgan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EOj3NzxenJS6ygN11HHeOw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/959121cfa3623199d125fb23daf6c87c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718635", "eventUri": "eng-9718635", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

They can be captured in an FOI [freedom of information request] and I think we are all in the right place on the choice being made.\"\n\nOur disclosure that Mr Gething had deleted the messages indicated strongly that he had misled the UK Covid Inquiry. He had given both written and oral evidence to the Inquiry under oath in which he claimed messages had been deleted from his mobile phone during a refit by the Senedd's IT department. He went on to express both regret and embarrassment that he was unable to provide them. At no stage did Mr Gething admit that he had deleted messages because he considered they would be subject to freedom of information disclosure.\n\nThe UK Covid Inquiry asked all the governments of the UK to disclose to it all material they held relevant to the making of decisions during the Covid Inquiry. In the run-up to the publication of our May 7 story, the Welsh Government suggested to us that the messages could have been related to \"anything\", but NationCymru was confident that the messages related to both the Welsh Government and to the handling of the Covid crisis.\n\nStatement\n\nPreviously a statement issued to the users of Welsh Government mobile phones in February 2019 had made it clear that messages written on mobile phones could be regarded as Welsh Government business and should be preserved.\n\nThe statement said: \"Text and Instant Messaging Text or 'instant messages' are electronic mail and messaging systems used for the purposes of communication between individuals. Staff should be aware that when using their WG phones in this way they are in fact creating 'public records'. Staff using private phones for WG business may also be creating public records. The ephemeral nature of text messages (and instant messaging) heightens the need for users to be aware that they may be creating records using this application, and to properly manage and preserve record content.\"\n\nMr Gething knew full well that conversations in the Labour group were not subject to FOI disclosure, nor were messages in the ministerial chat that related to individual Members of the Senedd. Only Welsh Government business was liable for disclosure, and therefore \"the messages in this group\" referred to in Mr Gething's deletion message constituted Welsh Government business.\n\n\"They related to the decision - or \"choice\" as Mr Gething put it - to change the way students were assessed for GCSEs and A-levels. One of the other messages in the screenshot leaked to us had a minister - not Mr Gething - referring facetiously to an algorithm. It so happened that on the very same day that Mr Gething signalled his intention to delete messages, the Welsh Government announced that GCSE and A-level grades would be awarded on the basis of teachers' assessment of students rather than being determined by an algorithm.\n\nWelsh Government business\n\nClearly, then, the matter under discussion, and the \"choice\" referred to by Mr Gething in his message, was both Welsh Government business and Covid related. The reason, of course, for choosing a new means of assessing students' exam grades was because their education had been interrupted during lockdown.\n\nEqually, as a lawyer and a minister of some years' standing, Mr Gething knew that to be captured in an FOI, the messages had to relate to Welsh Government business.\n\nA Welsh Labour source told us: \"The government led by Vaughan Gething is in turmoil. He has sacked a minister accusing her of putting information in the public domain that should have been in the public domain anyway.\n\n\"Since NationCymru's revelation he decided to hand over the relevant screenshot with the incriminating message to the Covid Inquiry. That is an admission that he should have passed the messages over to the Inquiry in the first place. If anyone should be leaving the government, it is not Hannah Blythyn, but Vaughan Gething himself.\"\n\nNationCymru does not reveal its sources of information, but has no doubt it did the right thing in revealing the truth about the deleted messages.", "source": {"uri": "nation.cymru", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nation.Cymru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_mansfield@nation.cymru", "name": "Mark Mansfield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vaughan Gething"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of information"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Government", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Government"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Blythyn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Blythyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nation.Cymru", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nation.Cymru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instant messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Level", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A-Level"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Senedd", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Senedd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_Labour", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welsh Labour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Certificate_of_Secondary_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Certificate of Secondary Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mass surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public domain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Etiquette", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Etiquette", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://nation.cymru/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/01H4G2ZD2PR9Q19AE88ZF9ASTG.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718635", "eventUri": "eng-9718635", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-17", "textStart": 1239, "textEnd": 1253}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-07", "textStart": 2232, "textEnd": 2237}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-02-", "textStart": 2557, "textEnd": 2570}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

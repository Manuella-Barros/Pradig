Night Shyamalan had a feeling his middle daughter Ishana Night Shyamalan had a keen interest in movies and would one day become a filmmaker, but he didn\u2019t let any excitement at the prospect of her following in his footsteps scare her off. Instead, he made sure to let Ishana\u2019s natural instincts about movies lead the way when they watched films together. \u201cI knew she would be a filmmaker, but I never pushed her into it,\u201d he told The New York Times in a 2021 joint interview with Ishana. \u201cWe\u2019d watch a movie and she would really connect with what we were watching. She was able to discern what was exceptional about what we had watched.\u201d Ishana was born to M. Night and his wife Bhavna, whom he married in 1993 after they met at New York University. Now, Ishana is making her own way with her horror movie The Watcher, a thriller starring Dakota Fanning that is due in theaters in June 2024 and could give her dad\u2019s scariest titles a run for their money. M. Night is delighted to see his daughter\u2019s hard work pay off, which includes obsessing over movies since her childhood and studying filmmaking at NYU, her parents\u2019 alma matter. \"[Ishana] has always made me very proud,\u201d he wrote on Instagram in February 2024 while sharing the film\u2019s trailer. \u201cAnd even better than making a dazzling film, she is a wonderful person.\u201d Here\u2019s everything to know about M. Night Shyamalan\u2019s daughter, Ishana Night Shyamalan. She knows her last name brings high expectations \u2013 and she welcomes the pressure Ishana didn\u2019t let her dad\u2019s legacy as one of the greatest horror directors of all time keep her from venturing into the genre. If anything, carrying her father\u2019s very famous last name made her want to prove herself even more. \"There are certain expectations the last name brings. But I love that, because it's something for me to knock down,\u201d she told The New York Times in 2021. \u201cHopefully, I put my own artistic stamp on what I create.\" Ishana has, however, noted the cyclical nature of seeing her dad direct when she was a child, only to go on to work on sets herself. \"I grew up on sets, watching over my dads shoulder as he directed. For the first time it went the other way around,\" she wrote in a June 2021 post on Instagram, alongside one photo of herself on set with her father on his film Lady in the Water, and another that showed M. Night with her as she directed an episode of Servant in 2020 (a show she also served as a writer and producer for). \"First photo taken in 2006 on the set of Lady in the Water. Second photo taken in 2020 by @kourkounis on the set of @servantofficial for my first episode. ~Ahhh the cyclicality of life~ :)?,\" Ishana added. She\u2019s the middle child of three girls Ishana is the middle child of her family, nestled between older sister Saleka and younger sister Shivani. While Shivani is a bit more private, Saleka is also in the entertainment industry \u2013 as a talented R&B singer. Saleka, who goes by her first name only as a performer, released her debut album Seance in May 2023 and has tapped Ishana to direct several of her music videos. In 2021, Ishana shared some behind-the-scenes tidbits on Instagram from shooting a music video for Saleka\u2019s song \u201cGraffiti,\u201d adding some complimentary words for her sister. \"This was a special one to direct,\" she wrote, in part, in the post's caption. \u201cThis song is written and performed so beautifully by @saleka,\u201d she added later in the message. \u201cIt illustrates the experience of so many women. It was an honor to shoot the visuals alongside such a powerful piece.\u201d M. Night introduced her to horror movies from a young age The iconic horror director raised his three daughters to be movie buffs, hosting constant movie nights that Ishana told The New York Times were \u201csacred\u201d in their home. Horror movies were also a constant, with M. Night instilling in Ishana a love of the genre that he\u2019s made his mark in from a very young age. \u201cFrom the time I was able to watch a movie, we were watching horror movies,\u201d Ishana told Variety in 2021, later adding, \u201cI remember in my elementary school in the library, I would come in every time and they would say, \u2018We have a new scary story for you.\u2019 I formed a sense of identity based on that when I was pretty young.\" She first showed off her directing skills on Servant Ishana got some of her first directing credits on the Apple TV+ show Servant, executive-produced by M. Night. Yet she wasn\u2019t sure at first about working on the project, which forced her to take time off school. Until her dad stepped in and encouraged her. \u201cI'd seen Ishana's short films, I'd seen her writing, she was going to NYU's Tisch School where I went, and I saw this opportunity,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly of convincing her daughter to take a semester off and work with him on the show. \u201cI just had an instinct that these were the right episodes for her. She was humble and worried a little bit.\" Once she got started, Ishana impressed everyone, and she went from directing just a few episodes in season 2 to essentially becoming the show\u2019s main writer and director. \u201cIt was astonishing. We ended up relying on her,\u201d M. Night told PEOPLE in 2023. \u201cOver those three years of growth for her \u2014 both for her and us \u2014 it was a trial by fire, and it worked out. It was something else \u2026 I couldn't be more proud of her and admire her.\" She served as second unit director on M. Night\u2019s movie Old Once she had some directing under her belt, Ishana was once again convinced by her dad to work on his next project together. Except this time, he wanted her to be the second unit director on his 2021 movie Old, a major job that required her to film several scenes from the movie while her dad focused on other parts. She handled the job like a pro, and the whole shoot turned into a sweet way to bond for the father-daughter duo who often had dinner together after a day of shooting, an experience M. Night described in a promotional video for the movie on Instagram as having \"made me feel like I never left home.\" \u201cI essentially grew up on sets, grew up looking over my dad\u2019s shoulder, and this is the first time we get to actually work together,\u201d she said in the same clip. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a special experience for us.\u201d M. Night is a proud dad M. Night isn\u2019t shy about praising Ishana and often shows what a proud dad he, sharing encouraging words and promoting Ishana\u2019s projects on Instagram. One especially sweet post came when Ishana\u2019s movie The Watcher was announced. M. Night proudly shared the news, adding a throwback picture of a young Ishana sitting on his lap while he was in a director\u2019s chair. \u201cI\u2019ll come visit your set now @ishy_night,\u201d the director captioned the February 2023 post. He was also present when Ishana started filming the movie in Dublin, and shared a picture of them on set to congratulate her on the momentous occasion. \u201cI\u2019m so moved and inspired by her. She leads everyone with grace and creative fire,\u201d he wrote, in part, of his daughter in the post's caption.", "summary": "M.

NATO leaders said in a declaration at their summit in Washington on Wednesday that China had 'become a decisive enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine', adding that Beijing's 'so-called 'no limits' partnership' and 'large-scale support for Russia's defence industrial base' were of 'profound concern'.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Beijing's mission to the European Union said: 'NATO should stop hyping up the so-called China threat and provoking confrontation and rivalry, and do more to contribute to world peace and stability. It is known to all that China is not the creator (of) the Ukraine crisis. China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard,' they added.\n\nFormer Russian president Dmitry Medvedev (pictured) chimed in, denouncing NATO's summit promise to grant eventual membership to Ukraine and said Russia should work towards the 'disappearance' of both Ukraine and the military alliance. In a social media post, Medvedev quoted in English from NATO's declaration at its Washington summit this week: 'We will continue to support (Ukraine) on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.'\n\nHe went on, in Russian: 'The conclusion is obvious. We must do everything so that Ukraine's 'irreversible path' to NATO ends with either the disappearance of Ukraine or the disappearance of NATO. Or even better - the disappearance of both.' The Russian state has backed Medvedev's response, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov (pictured left) telling Russian news agencies today that the nation is planning 'response measures' to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO. He added that NATO was now 'fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.'\n\nMedvedev, who during his 2008-2012 presidency was regarded as a pro-Western moderniser, has reinvented himself as an arch-hawk since the start of the war in Ukraine, something Moscow calls a 'special military operation.' In particular, he has repeatedly warned the U.S. and its allies that their arming of Kyiv could lead to a 'nuclear apocalypse'.\n\nAny decision on the use of Russian nuclear weapons would belong to President Vladimir Putin. But diplomats say the views of Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, give an indication of hawkish thinking at the top of the Kremlin which has cast the war as an existential struggle with the West. China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion and last year released a paper calling for a 'political settlement' to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to retain much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has grown closer since the invasion. Beijing presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations. It has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began. But that economic partnership has come under close scrutiny from the West in recent months, with Washington vowing to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow's war effort.\n\nThe United States and Europe have also accused Beijing of selling components and equipment necessary to keep Moscow's military production afloat. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April this included 'machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade'.\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept 'criticism or pressure' over its ties with Moscow. And on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of 'prejudice, smearing and provocation'.\n\n'NATO's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,' spokesman Lin Jian said. 'We urge NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to ease the situation, instead of shifting the blame to others.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

China's position on Ukraine is open and aboveboard,' they added.\n\nFormer Russian president Dmitry Medvedev chimed in, denouncing NATO's summit promise to grant eventual membership to Ukraine and said Russia should work towards the 'disappearance' of both Ukraine and the military alliance.\n\nChina and Russia have both threatened NATO against 'provoking confrontation' over the bloc's claims that Xi Jingping's nation holds a key role in Moscow 's invasion of Ukraine (File image)\n\nUkrainian refugee Mariia Hlyten holds a sign outside the NATO summit in Washington\n\nUkrainian infantry fire at Russian positions on the zero line of the front in prepared trenches 100 meters from the Russian trenches on July 5, 2025 in the direction of Toretsk region\n\nFormer Russian president Dmitry Medvedev (pictured) denounced NATO's summit promise to grant eventual membership to Ukraine\n\nIn a social media post, Medvedev quoted in English from NATO's declaration at its Washington summit this week: 'We will continue to support (Ukraine) on its irreversible path to full Euro-Atlantic integration, including NATO membership.'\n\nHe went on, in Russian: 'The conclusion is obvious. We must do everything so that Ukraine's 'irreversible path' to NATO ends with either the disappearance of Ukraine or the disappearance of NATO. Or even better - the disappearance of both.'\n\nThe Russian state has backed Medvedev's response, with Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov telling Russian news agencies today that the nation is planning 'response measures' to contain the \"very serious threat\" from NATO.\n\nHe added that NATO was now 'fully involved in the conflict over Ukraine.'\n\nMedvedev, who during his 2008-2012 presidency was regarded as a pro-Western moderniser, has reinvented himself as an arch-hawk since the start of the war in Ukraine, something Moscow calls a 'special military operation.'\n\nIn particular, he has repeatedly warned the U.S. and its allies that their arming of Kyiv could lead to a 'nuclear apocalypse'.\n\nUkrainian infantry on the zero line of the front in prepared trenches 100 meters from the Russian trenches on July 5, 2025\n\nA view of a wall mural depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Kostiantynivka, Ukraine on June 30, 2024\n\nA destroyed statue in Chasiv Yar, Ukraine on July 06, 2024\n\nAny decision on the use of Russian nuclear weapons would belong to President Vladimir Putin. But diplomats say the views of Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, give an indication of hawkish thinking at the top of the Kremlin which has cast the war as an existential struggle with the West.\n\nChina has refused to condemn Russia's invasion and last year released a paper calling for a 'political settlement' to the conflict, which Western countries said could enable Russia to retain much of the territory it has seized in Ukraine.\n\nChina and Russia's strategic partnership has grown closer since the invasion.\n\nBeijing presents itself as a neutral party in the war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\n\nIt has however offered a critical lifeline to Russia's isolated economy, with trade booming since the conflict began.\n\nBut that economic partnership has come under close scrutiny from the West in recent months, with Washington vowing to go after financial institutions that facilitate Moscow's war effort.\n\nA view of a destroyed tank at the town of New York (Niu-York) as Torecki has so far been one of the quietest sections of the front line\n\nA view of a collapsed building at the town of New York (Niu-York) as Torecki has so far been one of the quietest sections of the front line as the Russians started shelling the area\n\nThe United States and Europe have also accused Beijing of selling components and equipment necessary to keep Moscow's military production afloat.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in April this included 'machine tools, semiconductors, other dual-use items that have helped Russia rebuild the defence industrial base that sanctions and export controls had done so much to degrade'.\n\nBeijing has denied claims it is aiding Russia's fighting in Ukraine and insisted it won't accept 'criticism or pressure' over its ties with Moscow.\n\nAnd on Thursday, its foreign ministry accused the alliance of 'prejudice, smearing and provocation'.\n\n'NATO's rhetoric about China's responsibility in Ukraine is unjustified and malicious,' spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\n'We urge NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own actions, listen carefully to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to ease the situation, instead of shifting the blame to others.'", "source":

We advise the NATO to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and its own moves, listen earnestly to the just voice of the international community, and take concrete actions to push for easing the situation, instead of shifting the blame to others.\"\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nViolence and uncertainty ahead of France's decisive parliamentary vote\n\nWho is Bardella and could the far-right millennial be France's new PM?\n\nLabour's landslide victory and its impact on the UK and beyond\n\nJian added: \"China urges the NATO to abandon the outdated concepts of Cold War mentality, bloc confrontation and zero-sum games, remedy its wrong perception of China, stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop darkening China's image and disturbing China-Europe relations, and stop messing up the Asia-Pacific after it has messed up Europe.\"\n\nWhile a formal timeline for Ukraine to join the military alliance has not been agreed at the summit, the military alliance's 32 members said they had \"unwavering\" support for Ukraine's efforts.\n\nFinland's President Alexander Stubb said: \"I think it's very important to give a message to the Kremlin from here that Ukraine's path and bridge towards NATO membership is now irreversible.\"\n\nRegarding the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said on social media: \"The conclusion is obvious. We must do everything so that Ukraine's 'irreversible path' to NATO ends with either the disappearance of Ukraine or the disappearance of NATO. Or even better - the disappearance of both.\"", "source": {"uri": "newseu.cgtn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "newseu.cgtn.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_summit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO summit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stubb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Stubb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine\u2013NATO_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine\u2013NATO relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmitry_Medvedev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dmitry Medvedev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://newseu.cgtn.com/news/2024-07-11/Russia-plans-military-response-to-contain-serious-threat-from-NATO-1v9uwsAAnpS/img/04e2e6beb93d4c28a845cc2f943a8d1b/04e2e6beb93d4c28a845cc2f943a8d1b-1920.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724123", "eventUri": "eng-9724123", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

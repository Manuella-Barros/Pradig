National | Globalnews.ca", "body": "Opposition parties are urging the public inquiry into foreign interference to investigate allegations of Canadian parliamentarians colluding with other governments, as described in a bombshell report released last week.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has introduced a motion requesting the terms of reference of the inquiry be expanded to include startling allegations that federal politicians \"wittingly\" participated in foreign interference schemes over the last five years.\n\nAs it stands, the commission's mandate is to \"examine and assess\" interference by China, Russia and other foreign states and \"any impacts\" on the 2019 and 2021 elections, meaning some of the allegations revolving around parliamentarians may fall outside the inquiry's scope.\n\nLast week, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) released a 92-page document containing allegations parliamentarians are working with foreign states, including sharing confidential information, meeting a \"known intelligence officer\" and accepting funds or favours.\n\nThe committee of parliamentarians, which is made up of MPs from all parties, \"examined information\" gathered between Sept. 1, 2018 and March 15 of this year.\n\nBoth the NDP and Conservatives say they will support the Bloc motion, which also requests that the House of Commons formally \"express concern that certain elected officials may be wittingly or unwittingly working in the interests of foreign powers.\"\n\nIn a statement Monday, Conservative MP Andrew Scheer said he has written a letter to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc and commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue asking the inquiry to \"issue a finding of fact for each case in the NSICOP report where a member of a House of Commons (or) Senate of Canada have knowingly participated in foreign interference.\"\n\n\"Canadians must learn the truth about these shocking allegations,\" Scheer added.\n\nLast month, the public inquiry into foreign interference - led by Hogue - released an interim report outlining \"troubling events\" in the last two elections, which undermined the rights of Canadian voters but were not found to have changed the result of the election itself.\n\nHogue's findings described China's \"sophisticated, pervasive and persistent\" attempt to meddle in Canada's democratic institutions.\n\nGlobal News has asked the inquiry whether it has requested classified documents from the Liberal government containing allegations parliamentarians are colluding with foreign states and is waiting for a response.\n\nThe Liberal government is resisting calls to identify the names of parliamentarians who allegedly collaborated with foreign governments, saying it is bound by Canada's official secrets law, and that the intelligence may be incomplete or out of context.\n\nLast Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland suggested it's up to the RCMP to decide the next steps.\n\n\"Law enforcement bodies of jurisdiction are seized of the issue,\" she said.\n\nBut the NSICOP report said the laws are not necessarily on the books to prosecute parliamentarians who \"wittingly\" collaborated with foreign states.\n\n\"Some (of the activities) may be illegal, but are unlikely to lead to criminal charges, owing to Canada's failure to address the long-standing issue of protecting classified information and methods in judicial processes,\" the report warned.\n\nThe Liberal government tabled Bill C-70, a sweeping piece of legislation meant to tackle foreign interference, which would include a registry of people in Canada acting on behalf of foreign governments.\n\nBut it's unclear whether it will be in place by the next federal election, which is slated for October 2025.\n\n\"We have put in place more tools to fight foreign interference than any previous government,\" Freeland told reporters Friday.", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType":

A bombshell report by Canadian lawmakers has unnerved Parliament Hill, alleging that unnamed politicians have been covertly working with foreign governments.\n\nThe revelation in heavily redacted findings released this week by an all-party national security committee adds intrigue to a separate and ongoing inquiry into foreign interference in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections.\n\nThe new report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians is the first to suggest that lawmakers in Canada's parliament may have helped foreign actors meddle in political campaigns and leadership races. Heightened anxiety in Ottawa about foreign interference comes in the middle of historic global elections where factors such as artificial intelligence and emboldened foreign powers are testing the resilience of democratic systems.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has been on the defensive since the allegations broke Monday. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the government to name names.\n\n\"The national security committee indicates there are members of this House that have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments,\" Poilievre said Wednesday. \"Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information -- who are they?\"\n\nThe findings put pressure on Canada's national police force to investigate potential criminal charges. The report also refuels debate on the ability of the federal government's deterrence mechanisms to curb foreign interference in a country whose political and legal system is considered one of the highest-performing in the world.\n\nThe all-party NSICOP said Monday that it has reviewed intelligence that suggests \"semi-witting or witting\" parliamentarians have worked with foreign missions to mobilize voters during a political campaign; have taken cash \"knowingly or through willful blindness\" from foreign missions or their proxies; and have shared privileged information with foreign diplomatic officials.\n\nThe committee with top-security clearance said it based its findings on more than 4,000 documents and some 1,000 pieces of evidence. Its report said China remains the largest foreign interference threat to Canada with India the second.\n\nThe intelligence included a claim that unnamed parliamentarians are taking direction from unnamed diplomats to \"improperly influence\" their colleagues or parliamentary business to the benefit of a foreign state.\n\nOne of the most damaging lines in Monday's report points out Canada's failure to address long-standing challenges in how national security information can be used in criminal proceedings. The report says this is one reason why criminal charges for the potentially illegal activities are unlikely.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters Tuesday that she takes the issue seriously. She deflected when asked if Canadians have the right to know the identity of the parliamentarians involved.\n\n\"We should recognize this is a new time,\" she said, adding that authoritarians want to undermine democracies by sowing public distrust in government.\n\nFreeland would not commit to releasing names, nor did she agree that \"sunlight\" on the issue would benefit democracy. On Wednesday, after her Liberal party's weekly caucus meeting, she ignored questions on the topic.\n\nThe Trudeau government called an inquiry into foreign interference in September in the wake of claims that the Chinese government helped mobilize voters against a Conservative candidate in western Canada and helped elect another as a Liberal in the Toronto area.\n\nIt tasked Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue with investigating foreign interference and election meddling, a topic that has also captured the interest of U.S. Congress.\n\nLast fall, Conservative MP Michael Chong appeared before the congressional-executive commission on China to testify about being targeted by Beijing because of his defense of Uyghur issues.\n\nChong discovered through media reports that a Chinese diplomat had been assigned to collect information on him and his family. Canada's spy agency has warned other Canadian parliamentarians, including NDP MP Jenny Kwan, that they were also being surveilled by China.\n\nAn initial report released by Hogue last month observed that the government's messy handling of foreign interference has undermined the public's faith in Canadian democracy.\n\nHogue's early findings stated that foreign interference did not significantly influence the 2019 or 2021 federal elections in a way that would have changed the fact that Trudeau's Liberals won back-to-back minority governments.\n\nThe Conservatives were initially quiet about this week's revelations, but on Wednesday Chong pressed the government to identify the parliamentarians alleged to have colluded with foreign state actors.\n\n\"We all know that no responsible government would reveal names under these types of confidential circumstances,\" Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc responded on the floor of the House of Commons.\n\nLeBlanc remained resolute Thursday against calls to release any names based on preliminary information.\n\n\"It's important for Canadians to understand that these names are contained in intelligence reports, in some cases, it's uncorroborated or unverified intelligence information,\" he told a parliamentary committee studying foreign interference. \"The idea that there's a perfect list of names that is entirely reliable that should be released to the public is simply irresponsible.\"\n\nDavid McGuinty, chair of the NSICOP, which published the buzzy redacted report, said the decision to publicize the names of lawmakers is outside of his control.\n\nMcGuinty and the nine other NSICOP members with top-secret security clearance are bound by Canada's Security of Information Act and risk prosecution if they inadvertently reveal classified information, he said.\n\nHe wouldn't say if he's bothered by sitting in the same party caucus with potential abettors of foreign interference.\n\n\"I'm more concerned about the fact that now the government has to move forward on this,\" McGuinty said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

MPs will vote on it on Tuesday and New Democrats have already said they will support the proposal.\n\nThe initiative was released by the Bloc on Friday. In an interview on Sunday, the motion's sponsor, MP Ren\u00e9 Villemure, said that the House leaders for all of the major political parties have already been in talks about it. He pointed out that all four parties came together last year to agree on the initial terms of the inquiry and wants them to do so again to ensure the new allegations get addressed.\n\n\"This is a public-interest subject, it's something really serious,\" Mr. Villemure said. \"This should not be a partisan issue, foreign interference has no colour and we're putting this motion forward hoping for unanimous consent.\"\n\nA guide to foreign interference and China's suspected influence in Canada\n\nThe Conservatives added their voice to the proposal on Sunday through a letter written by House Leader Andrew Scheer to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc. In it, he argued that handing the matter to the Hogue inquiry is the \"best way to balance the sensitivity of the intelligence information\" with the need for Canadians to know the truth, \"while providing a reasonable degree of due process\" for those accused.\n\nThe government declined to say Sunday whether it will accept the proposal. The motion could pass in the House if all opposition parties support it, but it is a non-binding vote.\n\nA national-security watchdog report last week revealed that some parliamentarians are collaborating with foreign governments for their own benefit. The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), an oversight body set up by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said in its special report that politicians are \"wittingly\" helping foreign governments like China and India meddle in Canadian politics.\n\n\"The integrity of our Parliament has been rocked by the findings of the special report,\" Mr. Scheer wrote in the letter to Mr. LeBlanc. \"If Canadians are to continue to have faith in their federal democratic institutions, they need to know who has broken their oath and betrayed their trust.\"\n\nHe said failing to let Justice Hogue investigate the alleged collaborators would erode Canadians' confidence in Parliament.\n\n\"Anything less risks fuelling public suspicion about a cover-up of information known to this government about members of Parliament working for foreign states against the interests of Canada.\"\n\nNSICOP, which is comprised of MPs from all major parties as well as senators, declined to identify the parliamentarians, saying it was constrained from doing so by restrictions built into its mandate. The government has refused to identify the federal politicians publicly and won't say how many are accused or whether any sit in cabinet.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office has had the classified version of the report since March but has yet to outline any next steps as a result of the revelations.\n\nIts bombshell findings have sparked a debate in Ottawa about how MPs and senators should proceed after being told of alleged collaborators in their midst. The Conservatives had previously challenged the government to name the alleged collaborators in the House of Commons. The governing Liberals have refused, saying it would be irresponsible.\n\nThe Bloc also say such a disclosure of names is irresponsible given national-security considerations. The NDP, meantime, have said that the government must find a way to release the names.\n\n\"Canadians deserve to know who these MPs are who are working to undermine our democracy,\" said NDP deputy leader Alexandre Boulerice in a statement announcing his party's support for the Bloc motion. \"We must restore confidence in our democratic process, institutions and those who represent them.\"\n\nIn his letter to Mr. LeBlanc, Mr. Scheer said the expanded mandate for Justice Hogue should include a requirement that she produce a finding of fact on each MP or senator, past or present, accused of knowingly participating in foreign interference. He recommended this be delivered in a report to Parliament no later than Oct. 1.\n\n\"These findings of fact would not constitute findings of criminal guilt, but would be intended to serve as an aid to the House and the Senate in the exercise of their respective privileges, immunities, and powers; to each political party whose members may be implicated; and above all to the Canadian public to strengthen its confidence in our political institutions,\" Mr. Scheer wrote.\n\nHe said the Hogue Commission should be provided with all of the unredacted evidence on which the NSICOP report was based \"and all necessary resources to allow it to carry out interviews and any further investigations required to assess the findings.\"\n\nThe NSICOP report said some politicians are accepting money from foreign governments and are communicating frequently with foreign governments to obtain support from community groups or businesses that foreign diplomats have promised to mobilize to help their campaigns.\n\nOthers are allegedly providing foreign diplomats with privileged information on fellow parliamentarians knowing that this information will be used to put pressure on pressure these colleagues to change their positions. Some are lobbying colleagues or influencing parliamentary business to help a foreign state or leaking confidential information to known intelligence officers of foreign states, the report said.\n\nFormer Canadian spy chief Richard Fadden has said that Canada can't allow allegations that parliamentarians are colluding with foreign powers to remain unresolved.\n\n\"Foreign interference by anybody is serious but the fact that parliamentarians might be involved makes it doubly serious,\" Mr. Fadden said Friday. \"And we need to do something about it before the next federal election.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There's no way I'd allow them to run as a candidate or sit in my caucus if they are named and they knowingly worked with a foreign government to undermine our country, he said.\n\nI hope other party leaders will do the same thing.\n\nGreen Party Elizabeth May also has asked for a briefing as soon as possible.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has not obtained clearance to review classified intelligence.

What I find common amid each of those government reviews, is a general leftist theme that democracy must be protected from election outcomes.\n\nI know that last sentence sounds a little goofy, but that's because leftism is exactly that weird and fraught with hypocrisy.\n\nKeep in mind, right now in Europe Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has banned any political opposition and cancelled elections in his country in order to \"preserve democracy.\" Meanwhile, the western politicians clap like seals and beclown themselves in support of the ridiculous assertion.\n\nDo you remember the statement, \"words progressives do not support are defined as violence; and violence progressives do support are defined as protests.\"\n\nWell, in the electoral version of that same theme, election outcomes leftists do not support are defined as threats to democracy; while manipulated election outcomes the leftists do support are defined as trustworthy.\n\nThis is the essential context for a rather alarming publication from the Canadian Government that says many of their elected politicians are working for foreign governments. The Canadian National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians published a report last week saying unnamed lawmakers in Canada's parliament (and there are many of them) have helped foreign actors meddle in Canadian government.\n\nCANADA - [...] Heightened anxiety in Ottawa about foreign interference comes in the middle of historic global elections where factors such as artificial intelligence and emboldened foreign powers are testing the resilience of democratic systems.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has been on the defensive since the allegations broke Monday. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the government to name names.\n\n\"The national security committee indicates there are members of this House that have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments,\" Poilievre said Wednesday. \"Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information -- who are they?\"\n\nThe findings put pressure on Canada's national police force to investigate potential criminal charges. The report also refuels debate on the ability of the federal government's deterrence mechanisms to curb foreign interference in a country whose political and legal system is considered one of the highest-performing in the world.\n\nThe committee with top-security clearance said it based its findings on more than 4,000 documents and some 1,000 pieces of evidence. Its report said China remains the largest foreign interference threat to Canada with India the second.\n\nThe intelligence included a claim that unnamed parliamentarians are taking direction from unnamed diplomats to \"improperly influence\" their colleagues or parliamentary business to the benefit of a foreign state.\n\n[...] The Trudeau government called an inquiry into foreign interference in September in the wake of claims that the Chinese government helped mobilize voters against a Conservative candidate in western Canada and helped elect another as a Liberal in the Toronto area.\n\nIt tasked Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue with investigating foreign interference and election meddling, a topic that has also captured the interest of U.S. Congress.\n\n[...] An initial report released by Hogue last month observed that the government's messy handling of foreign interference has undermined the public's faith in Canadian democracy. (read more)\n\nTo reassure the public the Canadian government and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's administration have stated that sunlight on the named politicians who are working on behalf of foreign governments will not be permitted.\n\nNo one in public will be allowed to know which politicians are working as foreign agents.\n\nIf you are a Canadian trucker against COVID mandates, you are a threat to democracy.

to expand a public inquiry into election interference to also probe allegations of treason against some lawmakers for secretly working with foreign governments.\n\nLegislators have been pressing Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government to name names following the revelations made last week in a heavily redacted national security committee report.\n\nIt also claimed that China and India meddled in Canadian party leadership campaigns, including that of Trudeau\u2019s main rival, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nBeijing routinely denies accusations of interference.\n\nMPs were expected on Tuesday to pass an opposition motion calling for an independent inquiry that is already looking into foreign interference in Canada\u2019s 2019 and 2021 elections to scrutinise possible treason too.\n\nThe inquiry led by Justice Marie-Josee Hogue was launched last September.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely important that we continue to take foreign interference with all the seriousness that it requires,\u201d Trudeau said.\n\nThe opposition motion is non-binding on the government, but he said his Liberals would vote with opposition parties to ask Hogue to further investigate the claims so that \u201cCanadians can have confidence in the integrity of their democracy\u201d.\n\nIn the House of Commons earlier, opposition parties urged transparency.\n\n\u201cConservatives are demanding that the government expand the scope of the foreign interference public inquiry to receive all documents and information and reveal the names of which MPs have sold out their country,\u201d said Tory MP Andrew Scheer.\n\nBloc Quebecois MP Pierre Paul-Hus, who presented the motion, said: \u201cWe need to know who these members are who are collaborating with hostile foreign countries\u201d.\n\nHe was echoed by New Democratic Party leader and Trudeau ally Jagmeet Singh, who called the findings \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d and demanded accountability. \u201cCanadians ought to know,\u201d he said.\n\nThe National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) in a report last week cited \u201ctroubling intelligence that some Parliamentarians are \u2018semi-witting or witting\u2019 participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in our politics\u201d.\n\nThis included the secret funding of political campaigns, sharing of confidential information or privileged information on the work or opinions of fellow lawmakers with foreign intelligence officers, and influencing Canadian lawmakers to advantage a foreign state.\n\nThe report did not identify Canadians implicated in the schemes, but chided Ottawa for its \u201cslow response to a known threat\u201d.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc refused to reveal the identities of lawmakers mentioned in the report, saying doing so was itself illegal.\n\nHe also said the allegations in the NSICOP report may include uncorroborated or unverified intelligence information.\n\nAdditional

I am vastly relieved.\n\nLast week, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), a cross-party committee of MPs and senators with top security clearances, released a heavily redacted document alleging some parliamentarians have actively helped foreign governments meddle in Canadian politics.\n\nMay has a top security clearance allowing her to see classified intelligence and was granted access to the unredacted version of NSICOP Monday night. She said reactions to the report since it was tabled last week have triggered a totally understandable media firestorm, which in my view is overblown.\n\nWATCH | May says she has 'no worries' about sitting MPs after reading unredacted NSICOP report\n\n'There is no list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada,' Green Party co-leader Elizabeth May said Tuesday after reading the full, unredacted NSICOP report looking into foreign interference.\n\nMay described the contents of the report as not as bad as a John le Carr\u00e9 novel but a bit more worrying than Miss Marple.\n\nSo I am very glad I read the full report. I am very comfortable sitting with my colleagues, said the veteran parliamentarian.\n\nSaying that I'm relieved does not mean that there is nothing to see here folks. There are clearly threats to Canadian democracy from foreign governments.\n\nThe unredacted report, tabled in the House of Commons last week, described what it called particularly concerning behaviour by some parliamentarians.\n\nThe report said some elected officials began wittingly assisting foreign state actors soon after their election. The report said unnamed members of Parliament worked to influence their colleagues on India's behalf and proactively provided confidential information to Indian officials.\n\nMay, who told reporters that she had to tread carefully to avoid disclosing classified information, said the report lists the names of less than a handful of MPs who may have been compromised by foreign governments.\n\nThey have been beneficiaries of foreign governments interfering in nomination contests, she said.\n\nAre there currently MPs sitting with us in the chamber who would set out knowingly to sell out Canada for personal benefit? If there are, there's no evidence of that in the full report.\n\nShe also said she did not read any specific reference to the Senate in the report.\n\nMay said the most troubling case in NSICOP's report involved a former MP who maintained a relationship with a foreign intelligence officer.\n\nThe report says that, according to the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), the MP sought to arrange a meeting in a foreign state with a senior intelligence official and also proactively provided the intelligence officer with information provided in confidence.\n\nMay said that person, who was not named in the unredacted report, should be fully investigated by police.\n\nThe RCMP has said it is probing cases involving foreign interference but would not say whether it's investigating parliamentarians.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who also has a top security clearance, has asked for a briefing on the NSICOP report. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said Tuesday he's in the process of getting cleared to view the report.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has not sought clearance to review classified intelligence. He has argued that doing so would prevent him from commenting publicly.\n\nElizabeth May took on her responsibilities as party leader, got her security clearance and did the work, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Poilievre should do that too. He is choosing ignorance so he can play partisan politics.\n\nMPs are expected to vote on a Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois motion that calls for expanding the mandate of the public inquiry investigating foreign election interference to allow it to investigate the claims in the NSICOP report concerning MPs and senators.\n\nWATCH | Public safety minister says he won't name parliamentarians in NSICOP report\n\nDuring question period, Conservative MP Jasraj Singh Hallan pushed Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc to name parliamentarians included in a recent foreign interference report, but LeBlanc said he would not do that since the RCMP told him he could face criminal prosecution.\n\nThe Liberal government has said it will support the motion and has already reached out to commissioner Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's staff to discuss next steps.\n\nMay said she was going to vote in favour of the motion but, after reading the report, changed her mind.\n\nI think the Bloc motion is its throwing a hot potato in the wrong soup pot, she said Tuesday.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Some of this behaviour absolutely appears to be criminal and should be prosecuted,\" Mr. Singh said.\n\nThe NDP Leader is the second opposition leader to review the top-secret version of the report, which was redacted before being released last week by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP). However, his take-away from the report paints a much more concerning picture than the one painted by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May after she read the report earlier this week.\n\nThe redacted report said a number of federal politicians, whom it declined to identify, are collaborating with countries such as India and China. However, the specific examples and details of the interference were not disclosed in the public version of the report.\n\nThe document was written by a committee made up of MPs and Senators, representing the Liberals, the Conservatives, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, and the NDP.\n\n\"I am more alarmed today than I was yesterday after having read the report,\" Mr. Singh said. \"What is clear to me is that Justin Trudeau knew and didn't act, while Pierre Poilievre doesn't even want to know about serious allegations touching his party.\"\n\nSome parliamentarians collaborated with China and India to further their own interests, report says\n\nThe New Democrats are calling for the scope of the public inquiry into foreign interference to be expanded again - this time to delve into revelations in the NSICOP report that China and India interfered in Conservative leadership races.\n\nThe report's public version says there were \"two specific instances\" where officials from the People's Republic of China allegedly interfered in the leadership races. It also says India allegedly interfered in one of the leadership races.\n\nThe official opposition is the only major federal party to hold such a competition during the time frame the committee reviewed: September, 2018 to March, 2024.\n\nThere were two races held in that window. One in 2020, won by Erin O'Toole, and another in 2022, which Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre won.\n\nIn a letter to Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc sent on Monday but released publicly on Thursday, the NDP said the allegations are \"deeply concerning\" to Canadians.\n\nThe letter also called for the inquiry to investigate the most damning disclosures in the report that the country's intelligence services believe some parliamentarians are \"semi-witting or witting\" participants in foreign-interference efforts.\n\nMembers of the House of Commons have already asked the inquiry, led by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, to study those allegations.\n\nNDP MP and public safety critic Alistair MacGregor, one of the signatories of the letter send to Mr. LeBlanc, said in an interview Thursday that the party made the request because its \"important that we cover all avenues.\"\n\n\"Our ultimate goal is to make sure that all ballots, including those at the party level, are free from foreign interference,\" he said.\n\nThe Conservative Party did not explicitly say whether it would support such a probe, but Mr. Poilievre's spokesperson Sam Lilly called the request nonsense and a \"clear deflection by the Liberal-NDP Government.\"\n\nHe added that the Conservative party rules only allow citizens and permanent residents to vote in their leadership races and pointed out that Mr. Poilievre won his race in a landslide. He received 68 per cent of the vote.\n\nMr. LeBlanc's office did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.\n\nMr. Poilievre is the only leader that has declined access to classified information on foreign intelligence, including the NSICOP report.\n\nIn a news conference on Tuesday, Ms. May said the secret version of the report does not detail any examples of sitting MPs being disloyal to Canada.\n\nShe said having read the classified report, she is \"vastly relieved\" and has \"no worries about anyone in the House of Commons.\"\n\nMs. May said it does not detail any examples of sitting members of Parliament wittingly collaborating with foreign states, though she said some may be caught up in the meddling.\n\n\"While a few named people may have been compromised by foreign influence, it falls far short of what could be considered disloyalty to Canada,\" Ms. May said at the news conference.\n\nThe impact of foreign interference efforts were separately highlighted on Parliament Hill Thursday by MPs who were the targets of hackers linked to Beijing. The Globe and Mail first reported on the incidents in April. MPs were only notified about it years after it happened and by American authorities rather than Canadian.\n\nConservative MP James Bezan told the Procedure and House Affairs committee that it is \"embarrassing\" that politicians learned of the matter through the FBI.\n\nLiberal MP Judy Sgro also told the committee that she was disappointed about how the information was communicated to them.\n\n\"We need to know,\" she said. \"Parliamentarians need to know when there's been a threat levelled against us.\"\n\nMs. Sgro also said she believes there should be a significant presentation for all parliamentarians on security issues in September. MPs need to know what steps they should be taking, or not taking, and where to go for follow-up, she added.\n\nAlso on Thursday, the House of Commons approved Bill C-70, the countering foreign interference legislation, in a unanimous vote with the support of 317 MPs. It will now go to the Senate and is expected to receive royal assent by the end of the month.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors":

The party said in a press release it's crucial the Liberal government \"provide full, unredacted information so they can independently access these accusations.\"\n\nThe NDP asked the government to ensure the Hogue Commission looks into the parliamentarians who participated in meddling and into findings involving interference by China and India in the Conservative Party's leadership races.\n\nDuring question period on Monday, LeBlanc told MPs that senior officials have already begun discussions with the Hogue Commission about expanding its work.\n\n\"We're going to support the motion precisely because we think the Hogue Commission offers us an appropriate forum whereby the allegations that surfaced (from the committee) can be examined,\" he told reporters after question period.\n\nLeBlanc said the commission has the appropriate security clearances to review the intelligence.\n\n\"If the commission wants to work with the government, we believe they do, we would obviously be very, very anxious to ensure that they have all the resources and the time necessary to do this work,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the government will collaborate with the commission if it says it needs any changes to its terms of reference, including report deadlines.\n\nDuring question period, Conservative MP Michael Cooper said once Hogue has made the findings of fact, she should release the names of parliamentarians who knowingly \"collaborated with hostile foreign states.\"\n\nLeBlanc declined to answer when asked whether Hogue should release those names, if she finds the individuals participated in meddling knowingly. He said the question was too hypothetical to responsibly answer it.\n\nThe NDP, Bloc and Green Party have asked for access to the classified version of the report, which was already provided to cabinet ministers and the prime minister.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh told reporters that if the report shows any NDP MP knowingly participated in meddling, he would immediately remove them from the NDP caucus. \"I expect other party leaders to do the same thing,\" he said.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 10, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "cornwallseawaynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cornwall Seaway News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Period", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Question Period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Quebec"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cooper_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cooper (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/06/b5aa7644-3df9-4cef-b76f-c22367e86924.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-06-", "textStart": 3195, "textEnd": 3202}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

The National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), an oversight body set up by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, said in its special report that politicians are \"wittingly\" helping foreign governments like China and India meddle in Canadian politics.\n\nNSICOP, which is comprised of MPs from all major parties as well as senators, declined to identify the parliamentarians, saying it was constrained from doing so by restrictions built into its mandate. The government has refused to identify the federal politicians publicly and won't say how many are accused or whether any sit in cabinet.\n\nThe Prime Minister's Office has had the classified version of the report since March but has yet to outline any next steps as a result of the revelations.\n\nThe bombshell findings have sparked a debate in Ottawa about what MPs and senators should do after being told of alleged collaborators in their midst.\n\nThe Conservatives had previously challenged the government to name the alleged collaborators in the House of Commons. The governing Liberals have refused, saying it would be irresponsible.\n\nIn a Sunday letter to Mr. LeBlanc, Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer recommended how Justice Hogue might proceed.\n\nMr. Scheer said the expanded mandate for Justice Hogue should include a requirement that she produce a finding of fact on each MP or senator, past or present, accused of knowingly participating in foreign interference. He recommended this be delivered in a report to Parliament no later than Oct. 1.\n\n\"These findings of fact would not constitute findings of criminal guilt, but would be intended to serve as an aid to the House and the Senate in the exercise of their respective privileges, immunities, and powers; to each political party whose members may be implicated; and above all to the Canadian public to strengthen its confidence in our political institutions,\" Mr. Scheer wrote.\n\nHe said the Hogue Commission should be provided with all of the unredacted evidence on which the NSICOP report was based \"and all necessary resources to allow it to carry out interviews and any further investigations required to assess the findings.\"\n\nThe NSICOP report said some politicians are accepting money from foreign governments and are communicating frequently with foreign governments to obtain support from community groups or businesses that foreign diplomats have promised to mobilize to help their campaigns.\n\nOthers are allegedly providing foreign diplomats with privileged information on fellow parliamentarians knowing that this information will be used to put pressure on these colleagues to change their positions. Some are lobbying colleagues or influencing parliamentary business to help a foreign state or leaking confidential information to known intelligence officers of foreign states, the report said.\n\nFormer Canadian spy chief Richard Fadden has said that Canada can't allow allegations that parliamentarians are colluding with foreign powers to remain unresolved. \"Foreign interference by anybody is serious but the fact that parliamentarians might be involved makes it doubly serious,\" Mr. Fadden said Friday. \"And we need to do something about it before the next federal election.\"",

The NDP said it would remove MPs from its caucus upon learning of collusion. The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois has tabled a motion to refer the matter to the Foreign Interference Commission.\n\nAs for the governing Liberals facing the pressure, they have said an internal party review is in order, but that releasing the names would be illegal and irresponsible. They have, however, backed the Bloc's motion.\n\nAll other major parties did similarly in the vote that took place on June 11, but there was one holdout, and it came with a particular perspective.\n\nGreen Party Co-Leader Elizabeth May said she changed her mind about supporting the Bloc's motion after reading the unredacted version of the intel watchdog's report. Her colleague Mike Morrice also voted against the Bloc's motion.\n\nThe committee reported seeing \"troubling intelligence that some Parliamentarians are, in the words of the intelligence services, 'semi-witting or witting' participants [original emphasis] in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in our politics.\"\n\nDespite this warning, Ms. May told reporters on June 11 she has \"no worries about anyone in the House of Commons.\"\n\n\"There is no list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada,\" she said, while adding that fewer than a handful of MPs \"may be compromised.\"\n\n\"They have been beneficiaries of foreign governments interfering in nomination contests,\" said Ms. May.\n\nNSICOP is a committee of lawmakers of all stripes, which reports to the prime minister and not Parliament. Its report notes a number of scenarios involving parliamentarians and foreign actors.\n\nIt says that some parliamentarians frequently communicate with foreign missions before and during political campaigns to obtain help in mobilizing supporters. Others have accepted funds from foreign missions, \"knowingly or through willful blindness.\"\n\nSome have provided confidential information to a known foreign spy or sought to influence their colleagues for the benefit of a foreign state.\n\nThe Liberal government, however, says that doing so would be irresponsible and a breach of secrecy laws. But it expressed support for having the public inquiry into foreign interference review the matter.\n\n\"We agree with members of this House that the appropriate forum to look at these matters is the commission already set up and operating,\" said Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc on June 10.\n\nMr. LeBlanc noted that the commission already has access to all the documents consulted by NSICOP for its review. He added that talks are already underway on the matter between the commission and the Privy Council Office.\n\n\"We think that's a responsible way to proceed, not simply standing up and illegally announcing a list of names like my colleague suggests,\" said Mr. LeBlanc.

If there are, there's no evidence of that in the full report.\"\n\nWhile May said she was \"relieved\" after reading the report, she added the report points to troubling cases of foreign interference across different levels of government and civil society.\n\nMay said the most troubling case in NSICOP's report involved a former MP who maintained a relationship with a foreign intelligence officer.\n\n\"Saying that I'm relieved does not mean that there is nothing to see here folks. There are clearly threats to Canadian democracy from foreign governments,\" she said.\n\nBloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said Tuesday he's inquired about getting security clearance to view the report.\n\nThat would make Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre the only major party leader to refuse to obtain the necessary security clearance to read the report.\n\nConservative foreign affairs critic Michael Chong defended Poilievre's decision Thursday after testifying before a Senate committee.\n\n\"The leader would not be able to divulge this information to anyone else and therefore would not be able to act on this information,\" said the MP, who was himself a target of Beijing's foreign interference.\n\n\"At the end of the day, if members of the House of Commons are knowingly and wittingly assisting foreign states to the detriment of Canada's national interest, to the detriment of the people of Canada, then those individuals need to be held accountable. That's not up for party leaders to decide expulsion.\"\n\nThe redacted NSICOP report said foreign actors from India and the People's Republic of China interfered in more than one race for the leadership of the Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nThe public report does not provide any further information about the nature of the alleged interference, or state which Conservative leadership races were allegedly targeted and when.\n\nSingh said Poilievre doesn't want to read a report that contains \"serious allegations touching his party.\"\n\n\"To me, that disqualifies him as a leader, and I do not buy his phoney excuses,\" he said.\n\n\"It is clear that both of them, Justin Trudeau and Pierre Poilievre, want to protect their party rather than defending the country.\"\n\nThe NSICOP report called the Liberal government's response to the known threat of foreign interference \"a serious failure ... from which Canada may feel the consequences for years to come.\"\n\n\"The prime minister has had access to intelligence that raises concerns about MPs ... knowingly benefiting from foreign interference,\" said Singh.\n\n\"He may disagree with that intelligence, but I believe he has not taken the steps he should have to deal with this.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Since then, Parliament Hill has been consumed with reaction. Conservatives have demanded that names be released, which the Liberal government said it is legally unable to do.\n\nOn Monday, the Liberals said allegations of federal politicians colluding with other countries should be turned over to the foreign interference inquiry headed by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday ceded to opposition pressure to expand a public inquiry into election interference to also probe allegations of treason against some lawmakers for secretly

committee report.\n\nThe report also claimed that China and India meddled in Canadian party leadership campaigns, including that of Trudeau's main rival, Tory leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nMembers of Parliament were expected on Tuesday to pass an opposition motion calling for an independent inquiry that is already looking into foreign interference in Canada's 2019 and 2021 elections to scrutinize possible treason, too.\n\nThe inquiry led by Justice Marie-Josee Hogue was launched last September.\n\n\"I think it's extremely important that we continue to take foreign interference with all the seriousness that it requires,\" Trudeau said.\n\nThe opposition motion is nonbinding on the government, but he said his Liberals would vote with opposition parties to ask Hogue to further investigate the claims so that \"Canadians can have confidence in the integrity of their democracy.\"\n\nIn the House of Commons earlier, opposition parties urged transparency.\n\n\"Conservatives are demanding that the government expand the scope of the foreign interference public inquiry to receive all documents and information and reveal the names of which MPs have sold out their country,\" said Tory MP Andrew Scheer.\n\nBloc Quebecois MP Pierre Paul-Hus, who presented the motion, said: \"We need to know who these members are who are collaborating with hostile foreign countries.\"\n\nHe was echoed by New Democratic Party leader and Trudeau ally Jagmeet Singh, who called the findings \"deeply troubling\" and demanded accountability. \"Canadians ought to know,\" he said.\n\nThe National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) in a report last week cited \"troubling intelligence that some Parliamentarians are 'semi-witting or witting' participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in our politics.\"\n\nThis included the secret funding of political campaigns, sharing of confidential information or privileged information on the work or opinions of fellow lawmakers with foreign intelligence officers, and influencing Canadian lawmakers to advantage a foreign state.\n\nThe report did not identify Canadians implicated in the schemes, but chided Ottawa for its \"slow response to a known threat.\"\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc refused to reveal the identities of lawmakers mentioned in the report, saying to do so was itself illegal.\n\nHe also said the allegations in the NSICOP report may include uncorroborated or unverified intelligence information.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"},

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday ceded to opposition pressure to expand a public investigation into allegations some members of Parliament and senators knowingly conspired with foreign adversaries, including China and India, to influence elections and politics at home.\n\nAfter reviewing 4,000 classified documents and 1,000 pieces of evidence, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) released a special report last week claiming unnamed federal-level elected officials have been \"in the words of the intelligence services, 'semi-witting or witting' participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in our politics.\"\n\nTrudeau was asked about the report at a press conference in Quebec City on Monday.\n\n\"Mr. Trudeau, you've seen the NSICOP report. Do you think the allegations in it rise to the level of treason?\" a reporter said.\n\nEUROPEAN VOTERS REJECT SOCIALISM, FAR-LEFT POLICIES IN EU PARLIAMENT ELECTIONS: 'POLITICAL EARTHQUAKE'\n\nTrudeau responded: \"I think it's extremely important that we continue to take foreign interference with all the seriousness that it requires, which is why we will be supporting the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois motion to send the report and the concerns raised in it to Commissioner [Marie-Jos\u00e9e] Hogue's work to make sure there is a clear process whereby Canadians can have confidence in the integrity of the democracy.\"\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre called on Truduea's Liberal government to name the lawmakers referenced in the redacted report, but Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said doing so would be against the law. LeBlance said he did agree, however, to an expanded public inquiry sought by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois introduced a motion to broaden the scope of the Hogue Commission, which was already investigating foreign interference and elected meddling since September, \"to investigate parliamentarians who may have voluntarily or involuntarily worked for the interests of powers foreign.\" Trudeau first tasked Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue with leading the commission last fall amid allegations the Chinese government mobilized voters against a Conservative candidate in western Canada and helped elect another candidate as a Liberal in the Toronto area, Politico reported.\n\n\"Certain members of this House acted in the best interest of hostile foreign regimes interfering in Canada's democracy. This is a disgusting betrayal of Canadians who elected us,\" Conservative party legislator Jasraj Singh Hallan told the House of Commons on Monday, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that deputies or senators can serve, whether without their knowledge or not, as intermediaries for foreign powers hostile to our democracy,\" Ren\u00e9 Villemure, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois ethics spokesperson, said in a statement.\n\nIt is unclear, however, if the report will result in criminal charges.\n\nAt another point of the press conference Monday, Trudeau took an opportunity instead to condemn conservative and far-right party wins in France and elsewhere following the European Parliament elections. European voters largely rejected socialism and leftist policies at the polls on Sunday.\n\n\"We have seen around the world a rise of populist right-wing forces in just about every democracy that we've seen. And it is of concern to see political parties choosing to instrumentalize anger, fear, division, anxiety,\" Trudeau said. \"My approach has always been to respond to it. To understand it and to look to solve it. Roll up our sleeves, work hard and with ambition for this country and for our future. And I continue to be convinced that Canadians are thoughtful about the challenges we're facing and ready to see them solved, rather than allow themselves - have their anger amplified without any solutions offered.\"\n\nThe special report on \"foreign interference in Canada's democratic processes and institutions\" was released by the NSICOP on June 3. Its findings include that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and Communications Security Establishment (CSE) \"produced a body of intelligence that showed that foreign actors used deceptive and clandestine methods to cultivate relationships with Canadians who they believed would be useful in advancing their interests - particularly members of Parliament and senators - with a view of having the Canadian act in favour of the foreign actor and against Canada's interests.\"\n\nAMID MIGRANT SURGE, CANADA'S TRUDEAU SAYS IMMIGRATION THERE NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT 'UNDER CONTROL'\n\nWhile in some cases, \"parliamentarians were unaware they were the target of foreign interference,\" the reports noted how \"some elected officials, however, began wittingly assisting foreign state actors soon after their election.\" The report was redacted to remove \"injurious or privileged information,\" but indicates there are \"examples of members of Parliament who worked to influence their colleagues on India's behalf and proactively provided confidential information to Indian officials.\"\n\nWithout using the lawmaker's name, the redacted report mentions another \"textbook example of foreign interference that saw a foreign state support a witting politician.\"\n\nCanada's intelligence agency \"provided specific intelligence to the secret-cleared representatives of the party shortly before the election and to the Prime Minister shortly after\" and Trudeau \"discussed this incident with the Committee and the steps he took in response to the intelligence reporting,\" the special report says, redacting the specifics.\n\nThe People's Republic of China has remained \"the largest foreign interference threat to Canada,\" but since 2019, the committee assessed, Russia, which once came in second place, focused its strategic priorities elsewhere, while India emerged as the \"second-most significant foreign interference threat to Canada's democratic institutions and processes.\"\n\n\"The PRC's foreign interference efforts continue to be sophisticated, persistent and multidimensional, targeting all orders of Canadian government and various facets of society and relying upon a number of methods,\" the report says.\n\nThe CSIS assessed that the Chinese government \"believes that its relationship with some members of Parliament rests on a quid pro quo that any member's engagement with the PRC will result in the PRC mobilizing its network in the member's favour.\" The report notes the PRC \"would show support for lawmakers in ridings with large numbers of ethnic Chinese voters and who maintain close relationships with the Chinese ethnocultural community, including through Chinese leader and business people.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"In the period under review, intelligence reporting from CSIS and CSE showed that foreign states attempted to covertly buy influence with candidates and elected officials,\" the report says.\n\nThe PRC was also said to have used \"intermediaries to provide funds likely to support candidates in the 2019 federal election, including two transfers of funds approximating $250,000 through a prominent community leader, a political staffer and then an Ontario member of Provincial Parliament,\" but the report said \"CSIS could not confirm that the funds reached any candidate.\"\n\nAlso redacted from the report were details about \"CSIS information that an Indian proxy claims to have repeatedly transferred funds from India to politicians at all levels of government in return for political favours, including raising issues in Parliament at the proxy's request.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors":

a national security committee that some MPs \"wittingly\" participated in foreign meddling.\n\nThe National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians released their bombshell findings in a report last week.\n\nLeBlanc previously said the government wouldn't release the names of accused MPs, saying intelligence reports can contain unverified information and it's up to the RCMP to lay charges where appropriate.\n\nThe Conservatives and NDP have both penned letters to LeBlanc saying the inquiry led by Quebec judge Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue must be asked to report on the allegations.\n\nDuring question period on Monday, LeBlanc told MPs that senior officials have already begun discussions with the Hogue Commission about expanding its work.\n\n\"We're going to support the motion precisely because we think the Hogue Commission offers us an appropriate forum whereby the allegations that surfaced (from the committee) can be examined,\" he told reporters after question period.\n\nLeBlanc said the commission has the appropriate security clearances to review the intelligence.\n\n\"If the commission wants to work with the government, we believe they do, we would obviously be very, very anxious to ensure that they have all the resources and the time necessary to do this work,\" he said.\n\nHe added that the government will collaborate with the commission if it says it needs any changes to its terms of reference, including report deadlines.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published June 10, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "1059theregion.com",

But the committee did not say how Parliament should proceed from there -- what should be done now that unnamed members have been broadly accused of serious wrongdoing.\n\nLeft to their own devices, parliamentarians have been unable to arrive at a resolution. And in lieu of a clear path forward, the House of Commons has decided to ask for more help -- this time from Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's commission on foreign interference.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Hogue can bring more clarity to a situation that is crying out for it.\n\nIt is the Official Opposition's view that the government simply needs to name names.\n\nI would remind the minister and the government that what is being asked of the government is not to make known to the public sensitive intelligence, or sources and methods, Conservative MP Michael Cooper told the House on Monday. What is simply being asked of the Liberals, the government, is to provide the names of the compromised MPs and senators -- just the names, please.\n\nBut just releasing the names wouldn't necessarily be so simple. Releasing names without any evidence or supporting information could be unfair to the named MPs or senators. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc also told a House committee last week that, in some cases, allegations against parliamentarians are tied to uncorroborated or unverified intelligence information.\n\nWATCH: Public safety minister says he won't release names from NSICOP report\n\nDuring question period, Conservative MP Jasraj Singh Hallan pushed Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc to name parliamentarians included in a recent foreign interference report, but LeBlanc said he would not do that since the RCMP told him he could face criminal prosecution.\n\nLiberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith has argued (new window) that demanding names without also demanding due process is irresponsible. For the sake of avoiding a witch hunt, some kind of due process would seem sensible.\n\nAs Conservative MP Michael Chong reminded (new window) MPs on Monday, Parliament is empowered to govern its own membership and has the power to expel (new window) members. The last time Parliament exercised that power was in the case of an MP -- Fred Rose -- who was found to have spied for the Soviet Union. But in Rose's case, the House of Commons only voted to declare his seat vacant in 1947 (new window) after he had been convicted in court of violating the Official Secrets Act.\n\nIn this case, even NSICOP has acknowledged that criminal charges against the parliamentarians in question are unlikely.\n\nPhilippe Lagasse and Stephanie Carvin, two academics who have studied national security, have argued (new window) that the best -- and perhaps only -- path forward is for party leaders to take responsibility for their own caucuses.\n\nIn this scenario, each party leader would be given the security clearance necessary to view the intelligence that underpins NSICOP's report. The leaders could then take action to sideline or punish MPs whose activities are cause for concern -- or even ban those MPs from running under their party banner again.\n\nErskine-Smith has argued that approach would raise questions of procedural fairness. On the other hand, as Lagasse and Carvin note, MPs and senators have been expelled from caucus for far less.\n\nBut what Lagasse and Carvin propose is premised on the assumption that all party leaders would be willing to cooperate and act.\n\nIt's not clear yet whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- who has ready access to classified information -- has taken any action against Liberal MPs in response to the allegations contained in the NSICOP report. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, meanwhile, is refusing to go through the security clearance process that the government has offered to him so that he can view an unredacted version of the NSICOP report.\n\nWATCH: Poilievre calls on government to release names in NSICOP report\n\nIn the House of Commons, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said MPs accused in a recent intelligence report of colluding with foreign governments should be named publicly 'so Canadians can judge.'\n\nConservatives seem to view the offer as some kind of trap that would prevent Poilievre from questioning or challenging the government on the issue of foreign interference. It's not clear Poilievre wouldn't still be able to use parliamentary privilege to say whatever he wanted inside the House of Commons with impunity.\n\nBut regardless, his refusal to receive a security clearance could be preventing him from taking any of the actions that Lagasse and Carvin suggest.\n\nThe other three opposition leaders -- the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, Green Leader Elizabeth May and Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet of the Bloc Quebecois -- have agreed to view the unredacted NSICOP report. Singh will apparently have his chance on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday after being the first opposition leader to see the unredacted report, May said she came away feeling less suspicious of her colleagues.\n\nShe later told the CBC's Power & Politics that the unredacted report did not list the names of currently serving Parliamentarians accused of wittingly conspiring with foreign states -- which suggests even NSICOP may not be able to provide much clarity.\n\nWATCH: Elizabeth May says she has 'no worries' about her colleagues\n\nThere is no list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada,' Green Party co-leader Elizabeth May said Tuesday after reading the full, unredacted NSICOP report looking into foreign interference.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the House voted 320-2 to effectively punt the matter to Justice Hogue (May and fellow Green MP Mike Morrice voted against). Appealing to an independent adjudicator makes some sense, but it might also be months before we know whether Hogue is able to meaningfully clear the air.\n\nKent Roach, a law professor at the University of Toronto, points out that section 13 of the Inquiries Act states that no report shall be made against any person until reasonable notice has been given to the person of the charge of misconduct alleged against him and the person has been allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel. That suggests the foreign interference commission could offer due process and then name names.\n\nBut it's also conceivable that national security concerns could still stand in the way of releasing those names publicly. It also stands to reason that Hogue might find she is not able to definitively rule on any parliamentarian's guilt or innocence.\n\nEither way, the cloud over Parliament is going to hang there for a while yet. And one way or another, parliamentarians will end up having to do something about it themselves.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Canada"}, "authors":

No names have been named, no party singled out. But Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is refusing to fill in the blanks, leading to wild speculation that it is his party that's involved in treason.\n\nThe heavily redacted, 92-page report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) is a separate investigation from an inquiry into election interference by foreign powers in those elections.\n\n\"The national security committee indicates there are members of this House that have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments,\" Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre said Wednesday. \"Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information -- who are they?\"\n\nThe NSICOP said it reviewed intelligence that suggests \"semi-witting or witting\" members of Parliament have worked with foreign countries, \"to mobilize voters during a political campaign; have taken cash 'knowingly or through willful blindness' from foreign missions or their proxies; and have shared privileged information with foreign diplomatic officials.\"\n\nOne of the most damaging lines in Monday's report points out Canada's failure to address long-standing challenges in how national security information can be used in criminal proceedings. The report says this is one reason why criminal charges for the potentially illegal activities are unlikely.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters Tuesday that she takes the issue seriously. She deflected when asked if Canadians have the right to know the identity of the parliamentarians involved.\n\n\"We should recognize this is a new time,\" she said, adding that authoritarians want to undermine democracies by sowing public distrust in government.\n\nFreeland will not commit to releasing any names. Evidently, \"transparency\" is something reserved for members of the Conservative Party.\n\nJustice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue is conducting the parallel investigation into foreign interference in Canadian elections. Her commission is investigating \"claims that the Chinese government helped mobilize voters against a Conservative candidate in western Canada and helped elect another as a Liberal in the Toronto area,\" according to Politico.\n\nWhich members of Parliament are assisting foreign governments in interfering in elections?\n\n\"We all know that no responsible government would reveal names under these types of confidential circumstances,\" Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc responded on the floor of the House of Commons.\n\nDo we all know that?\n\n\"It's important for Canadians to understand that these names are contained in intelligence reports, in some cases, it's uncorroborated or unverified intelligence information,\" he told a parliamentary committee studying foreign interference. \"The idea that there's a perfect list of names that is entirely reliable that should be released to the public is simply irresponsible.\"\n\nDavid McGuinty, chair of the NSICOP, which published the buzzy redacted report, said the decision to publicize the names of lawmakers is outside of his control.\n\nMcGuinty and the nine other NSICOP members with top-secret security clearance are bound by Canada's Security of Information Act and risk prosecution if they inadvertently reveal classified information, he said.\n\nHe wouldn't say if he's bothered by sitting in the same party caucus with potential abettors of foreign interference.\n\n\"I'm more concerned about the fact that now the government has to move forward on this,\" McGuinty said.\n\nConservative MP Michael Chong, whom China has been targeting for his advocacy on behalf of Uyghurs, is demanding that the committee release the names. China had spied on him and his family, and he wanted to know which of his colleagues was helping them.\n\n\"Certain members of this House acted in the best interest of hostile foreign regimes interfering in Canada's democracy.

Even the spy services think that's rash.\n\nThe heavily censored public version of the NSICOP report revealed the worrisome news that some parliamentarians have been \"witting\" participants in foreign interference in a variety of ways.\n\nThe secret, unredacted version of the report names some names - and that has sparked calls for the identities of the disloyal parliamentarians to be made public, from commentators and from Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre.\n\nOne big problem with that is there is no standard set for taking the unprecedented step of publicly denouncing a politician as a collaborator. NSICOP didn't even suggest one in its report. Surely that's necessary before anyone publishes a traitors list.\n\nThese are cases where there is apparently no evidence that can be presented in court, where the allegations themselves might have to remain secret, and intelligence experts are sounding a note of caution.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc has warned that some of the names come from cases where the intelligence is \"uncorroborated or unverified.\"\n\nIf you don't want the matter to rest on the say-so of a Liberal cabinet minister, from a government that has appeared less than zealous in combatting foreign interference, then it's worth listening to Richard Fadden, a former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.\n\nMr. Fadden is no shrinking violet when it comes to these issues. As CSIS director in 2010, he was lambasted for stating publicly that the service was concerned that some provincial or municipal politicians could be under the sway of a foreign government. He told The Globe and Mail last week that something has to be done to follow up on the NSICOP report, but not simply revealing all the names.\n\n\"I don't believe that a person's career and life should be ruined on the basis of some piece of intelligence,\" Mr. Fadden said.\n\nThe people in charge of the intelligence services these days have other concerns, as well. They blacked out names and details from the report, and CSIS director David Vigneault expressed concern last week that releasing them would jeopardize intelligence-gathering secrets.\n\nBut that does not mean politicians can settle for doing nothing.\n\nFor starters, there's no excuse for wallowing in secrecy. Both Mr. Fadden and Mr. Vigneault called for party leaders to obtain security clearances and request briefings. Leaders can decide if there is enough reason to remove their MPs from their caucus or refuse to sign a candidate's nomination papers.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh has received a security clearance, Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet has suggested he might, but so far Mr. Poilievre has not.\n\nAt this point, there's no acceptable excuse for a party leader dodging that responsibility - especially if, as in Mr. Poilievre's case, you are calling for names to be released from a secret report you haven't sought to read.\n\nThen there is that bigger step: naming collaborators even when there isn't evidence that can be presented in court.\n\nThat's rarely been done by democracies in this century. If we don't want denunciations based on spies' suspicions and politicians' power games, then there'd better be some kind of standard set first.\n\nThere are two things that can be done now.\n\nOne is to put the matter of \"witting\" parliamentarians into the purview of the continuing inquiry on foreign interference headed by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, so that she can provide non-partisan, and hopefully revealing, findings.\n\nThe other is to send the matter back to Parliament. It must be up to NSICOP, or some special committee of MPs sworn to secrecy, to set a reasonable process to deal with an issue that can't be avoided.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fadden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Richard Fadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Security Intelligence Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Globe and Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Vigneault", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Vigneault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves-Fran\u00e7ois_Blanchet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/AGYIO4JOORAGZOG5K6GINBTOH4.JPG?auth=d628f8942459824c2a0e703e7f5d99f16dea4ecb7e71daa03362e41c25f440a3&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

They are not named in the unredacted report, but the involved country is, she said.\n\nThe Green leader also said that despite her relief there are no current MPs actively participating in foreign interference, serious concerns about foreign meddling in Canada persist.\n\n\"I would like to suggest to all colleagues in Parliament, particularly leaders of the other parties, that we refocus our public statements and parliamentary debates on what steps need to be taken to better protect our democracy,\" she said. \"It is clear some foreign governments see Canada as a pretty vulnerable, soft target.\"\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who has not yet read the classified report, said on Monday he will support the Bloc motion, and that if any member of his caucus is named, they will face consequences.\n\nThe Liberals also plan to support the Bloc motion, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said in a social media post on Monday.\n\nMay, in her address, thanked NSICOP members for their work on the report, saying they have to \"working in the shadows,\" and she is \"in awe of their work.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, that important work has been eclipsed by a totally understandable media firestorm, which in my view is overblown,\" she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement to CTV News, Foreign Interference Commission spokesperson Michael Tansey said \"the Commission will await the outcome of the vote on the Bloc Quebecois motion that was debated in the House of Commons today before determining whether to comment on it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news",

And in lieu of a clear path forward, the House of Commons has decided to ask for more help -- this time from Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's commission on foreign interference.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Hogue can bring more clarity to a situation that is crying out for it.\n\nIt is the Official Opposition's view that the government simply needs to \"name names.\"\n\n\"I would remind the minister and the government that what is being asked of the government is not to make known to the public sensitive intelligence, or sources and methods,\" Conservative MP Michael Cooper told the House on Monday. \"What is simply being asked of the Liberals, the government, is to provide the names of the compromised MPs and senators -- just the names, please.\"\n\nBut just releasing the names wouldn't necessarily be so simple. Releasing names without any evidence or supporting information could be unfair to the named MPs or senators. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc also told a House committee last week that, in some cases, allegations against parliamentarians are tied to \"uncorroborated or unverified\" intelligence information.\n\nLiberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith has argued that demanding names without also demanding \"due process\" is \"irresponsible.\" For the sake of avoiding a witch hunt, some kind of due process would seem sensible.\n\nAs Conservative MP Michael Chong reminded MPs on Monday, Parliament is empowered to govern its own membership and has the power to expel members. The last time Parliament exercised that power was in the case of an MP -- Fred Rose -- who was found to have spied for the Soviet Union. But in Rose's case, the House of Commons only voted to declare his seat vacant in 1947 after he had been convicted in court of violating the Official Secrets Act.\n\nIn this case, even NSICOP has acknowledged that criminal charges against the parliamentarians in question are unlikely.\n\nPhilippe Lagasse and Stephanie Carvin, two academics who have studied national security, have argued that the best -- and perhaps only -- path forward is for party leaders to take responsibility for their own caucuses.\n\nIn this scenario, each party leader would be given the security clearance necessary to view the intelligence that underpins NSICOP's report. The leaders could then take action to sideline or punish MPs whose activities are cause for concern -- or even ban those MPs from running under their party banner again.\n\nErskine-Smith has argued that approach would raise questions of procedural fairness. On the other hand, as Lagasse and Carvin note, MPs and senators have been expelled from caucus for \"far less.\"\n\nBut what Lagasse and Carvin propose is premised on the assumption that all party leaders would be willing to cooperate and act.\n\nIt's not clear yet whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- who has ready access to classified information -- has taken any action against Liberal MPs in response to the allegations contained in the NSICOP report. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, meanwhile, is refusing to go through the security clearance process that the government has offered to him so that he can view an unredacted version of the NSICOP report.\n\nConservatives seem to view the offer as some kind of trap that would prevent Poilievre from questioning or challenging the government on the issue of foreign interference. It's not clear Poilievre wouldn't still be able to use parliamentary privilege to say whatever he wanted inside the House of Commons with impunity.\n\nBut regardless, his refusal to receive a security clearance could be preventing him from taking any of the actions that Lagasse and Carvin suggest.\n\nThe other three opposition leaders -- the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, Green Leader Elizabeth May and Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois -- have agreed to view the unredacted NSICOP report. Singh will apparently have his chance on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday after being the first opposition leader to see the unredacted report, May said she came away feeling less suspicious of her colleagues.\n\nShe later told the CBC's Power & Politics that the unredacted report did not list the names of currently serving Parliamentarians accused of wittingly conspiring with foreign states -- which suggests even NSICOP may not be able to provide much clarity.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the House voted 320-2 to effectively punt the matter to Justice Hogue (May and fellow Green MP Mike Morrice voted against). Appealing to an independent adjudicator makes some sense, but it might also be months before we know whether Hogue is able to meaningfully clear the air.\n\nKent Roach, a law professor at the University of Toronto, points out that section 13 of the Inquiries Act states that \"no report shall be made against any person until reasonable notice has been given to the person of the charge of misconduct alleged against him and the person has been allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.\" That suggests the foreign interference commission could offer due process and then name names.\n\nBut it's also conceivable that national security concerns could still stand in the way of releasing those names publicly. It also stands to reason that Hogue might find she is not able to definitively rule on any parliamentarian's guilt or innocence.\n\nEither way, the cloud over Parliament is going to hang there for a while yet. And one way or another, parliamentarians will end up having to do something about it themselves.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

The past two weeks have been a doozy when it comes to news about foreign interference - we stitch together the events below, along with rehabbed falcons and Shackleton's last ship.\n\nLet's back up. Not all the way up - not to February, 2020, when Ottawa fielded an intelligence brief that found \"subtle but effective\" Chinese interference in the 2019 election; or to July, 2021, when a top-secret CSIS review, first reported by The Globe and Mail, warned that China saw Canada as a \"high-priority target\"; or even to September, 2023, when Quebec appeal court judge Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue agreed to head a public inquiry into foreign interference.\n\nLet's back up two weeks.\n\nOn May 30, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insisted that his cabinet had passed along more than enough documents to the inquiry. Never mind the footnote in Justice Hogue's report that month calling out the government for redacting and withholding certain records. The Liberals were done sharing.\n\nBut yesterday, the party supported a motion in the House of Commons to turn over some pretty major information: allegations about federal politicians colluding with hostile foreign states such as China and India. So how did we get here? Rewind the tape.\n\nMonday, June 3: In its special report on foreign interference, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, or NSICOP - a watchdog group of MPs and senators - drops a bombshell allegation. According to its intelligence, some federal politicians are \"witting or semi-witting\" participants in foreign efforts to disrupt Canadian democracy. Here's what that looks like: accepting money or perks from foreign governments, working together to mobilize community support in their favour, or handing over privileged information, knowing it would be used to put pressure on other politicians to change their votes.\n\nTuesday, June 4: Outcry is swift among opposition parties - the government has had this report since March - but Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc says only that authorities are working hard to protect Canadians. Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland says there will be an internal review.\n\nWednesday, June 5: Freeland clams up about that review, while The Globe confirms that the classified version of NSICOP's report does in fact name names. When Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre presses the government to release those names, LeBlanc invites him to apply for a security clearance so he can read the report.\n\nSaturday, June 8: A former CSIS director weighs in, encouraging federal leaders to request classified briefings and try to suss out who is named in that watchdog report.\n\nSunday, June 9: The Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois announce it's put forward a motion to send the allegations about meddling politicians to Justice Hogue and her public inquiry. The Conservatives and NDP quickly signal their support. The government declines to comment.\n\nMonday, June 10: But wait! Liberals say they will back the motion - and that they were already in touch with the inquiry over the weekend.\n\nTuesday, June 11: But wait! Green Party Leader Elizabeth May has actually read the unredacted report and says, in her view, there are no examples of current MPs wittingly colluding with foreign states - and it shouldn't be going to the inquiry anyway. Oh well: The Bloc's motion passes. Now we all wait to see what Hogue will do with this new information.\n\nRead (and hear) more: The Globe's senior parliamentary reporter, Steven Chase, dug into the watchdog report on The Decibel podcast. The Globe's editorial board demanded that Trudeau name those who colluded against Canada. Andrew Coyne called that collusion treason instead.\n\nWhen raptors are injured by power lines or territorial fights, the crew at Kenya's Soysambu reserve nurse them back to health. See more amazing photos (and one tenderly bandaged wing) here.\n\nOn shaky ground: Vancouver's Museum of Anthropology reopens this week after an 18-month, $40-million upgrade to help it survive a

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"There are also politicians at all levels of government who have benefited from foreign interference.

A major diplomatic rift between Canada and India occurred in September 2023 when Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly accused the Indian government of murdering Sikh activist Hardeep Singh Nijjar on Canadian soil.\n\nForeign interference has been a growing concern in Canada for years, but the NSICOP report still managed to shock the political and media establishments with the number of accusations it contained and the uncomfortable details it provided. The report was heavily redacted to conceal the identities of the accused politicians and details that could jeopardize national security.\n\nThe report was also strongly critical of Trudeau and his administration for ignoring warnings about foreign collusion. Trudeau's critics say his shocking negligence was an effort to protect his Liberal Party because many of the politicians who benefited from foreign money and political support were Liberals.\n\nTrudeau and his top officials seemed to believe they could ride out the storm by insisting the report had to stay redacted for national security reasons and by vaguely promising they would take its allegations seriously without ever revealing the details to the public.\n\nOn Monday, that strategy appeared to crumble in the face of a motion from opposition lawmakers to refer NSICOP's report to Justice Marie-Josee Hogue and her Foreign Interference Commission.\n\nThe Hogue Commission was established in September 2023 to investigate foreign meddling in Canada's 2019 and 2021 federal elections. The commission has already held two public hearings as part of its investigation and is required to submit a final report by the end of this year. The commission released an interim report in May that said foreign meddling definitely took place, but did not undermine the overall integrity of the elections.\n\nPublic Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, who has been taking point on the administration's response to the foreign collusion report because Trudeau was out of the country when the scandal erupted, said on Monday that the Liberal Party will support what is likely to be a nearly unanimous vote on authorizing the Hogue Commission to investigate NSICOP's findings.\n\n\"We agree with members of this House that the appropriate forum to look at these matters is the commission already set up and operating,\" he said.\n\nLeBlanc argued that \"illegally announcing a list of names\" would be irresponsible.\n\n\"I asked the Deputy Commissioner of the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) Mark Flynn this morning what would happen if I announced the list of names like my colleagues are asking me to do, and he said I would be subject to criminal prosecution. So guess what, Mr. Speaker? I'm not going to do that,\" he said during a parliamentary session.\n\nLeBlanc had earlier invited opposition leaders to obtain security clearances if they wanted to view the unredacted NSICOP report. Several of them have done so, but Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre refused because he feels the information should be made public, not viewed by a small circle of party leaders who would then be bound to secrecy.\n\n\"If Canadians are to continue to have faith in their federal democratic institutions, they need to know who has broken their oath and betrayed their trust,\" agreed Conservative House Leader Andrew Scheer.\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he would respect the promise of secrecy that came with the confidential briefing he has agreed to receive - but he also said he would not hesitate to eject any member of his party who \"wittingly\" participated in foreign collusion, so if a few NDP members get booted out right after Singh reads the unredacted report, it will not be hard for the public to figure out why.\n\nTrudeau said on Monday he supported the motion introduced by the Bloc Quebecois to get the Hogue Commission involved, because \"it's extremely important we continue to take foreign interference with all the seriousness it requires.\" The opposition would object to his cute phrasing, since a key element of the widening scandal is that Trudeau did not take foreign interference seriously.\n\nThe last few days have seen increasingly frank discussions among politicians and the press that some of the activity described in the NSICOP report could be labeled \"treason.\" Trudeau refused to answer when asked if he agreed with that label.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet is obtaining the necessary security clearances to do the same, while the Conservative's Pierre Poilievre has said he refuses to be constrained by secrecy rules -- which he says would prevent him from sharing some details publicly -- that he must follow to view the confidential document.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raisa_patel@thestar.com", "name": "Raisa Patel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_May", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves-Fran\u00e7ois_Blanchet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/fe/7feff576-b7d2-54e6-a65a-3034324191b9/666b5d5d80802.image.jpg?crop=1751%2C919%2C0%2C131&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Their findings allege \"pervasive and sophisticated foreign interference\" in Canadian politics, including allegations that multiple unnamed parliament members worked with foreign actors to influence elections and campaigns in 2019 and 2021.\n\nChina was called the most \"prolific actor,\" according to the report.\n\nThe NSICOP says alleged illegal activities by the Parliament members is unlikely to net criminal charges, citing in the report the difficulty of using classified information in judicial proceedings.\n\nOpposition members to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party have pressured the government to release the names of the alleged implicated parliament members. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre spoke last Wednesday during question time in Parliament, demanding the names be revealed.\n\n\"The National Security Committee indicates there are members of this House who have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments. Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information,\" Poilievre said, \"Who are they?\"\n\nSo far, the government has not committed to releasing the names of the parliamentarians responsible. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc pushed back on releasing the names of the MPs in response to Poilievre.\n\n\"The leader of the opposition knows very well no government, including the government [of] which he was a member, is going to discuss particularities of intelligence information publicly.

And in lieu of a clear path forward, the House of Commons has decided to ask for more help -- this time from Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's commission on foreign interference.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Hogue can bring more clarity to a situation that is crying out for it.\n\nIt is the Official Opposition's view that the government simply needs to \"name names.\"\n\n\"I would remind the minister and the government that what is being asked of the government is not to make known to the public sensitive intelligence, or sources and methods,\" Conservative MP Michael Cooper told the House on Monday. \"What is simply being asked of the Liberals, the government, is to provide the names of the compromised MPs and senators -- just the names, please.\"\n\nBut just releasing the names wouldn't necessarily be so simple. Releasing names without any evidence or supporting information could be unfair to the named MPs or senators. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc also told a House committee last week that, in some cases, allegations against parliamentarians are tied to \"uncorroborated or unverified\" intelligence information.\n\nLiberal MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith has argued that demanding names without also demanding \"due process\" is \"irresponsible.\" For the sake of avoiding a witch hunt, some kind of due process would seem sensible.\n\nAs Conservative MP Michael Chong reminded MPs on Monday, Parliament is empowered to govern its own membership and has the power to expel members. The last time Parliament exercised that power was in the case of an MP -- Fred Rose -- who was found to have spied for the Soviet Union. But in Rose's case, the House of Commons only voted to declare his seat vacant in 1947 after he had been convicted in court of violating the Official Secrets Act.\n\nIn this case, even NSICOP has acknowledged that criminal charges against the parliamentarians in question are unlikely.\n\nPhilippe Lagasse and Stephanie Carvin, two academics who have studied national security, have argued that the best -- and perhaps only -- path forward is for party leaders to take responsibility for their own caucuses.\n\nIn this scenario, each party leader would be given the security clearance necessary to view the intelligence that underpins NSICOP's report. The leaders could then take action to sideline or punish MPs whose activities are cause for concern -- or even ban those MPs from running under their party banner again.\n\nErskine-Smith has argued that approach would raise questions of procedural fairness. On the other hand, as Lagasse and Carvin note, MPs and senators have been expelled from caucus for \"far less.\"\n\nBut what Lagasse and Carvin propose is premised on the assumption that all party leaders would be willing to cooperate and act.\n\nIt's not clear yet whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau -- who has ready access to classified information -- has taken any action against Liberal MPs in response to the allegations contained in the NSICOP report. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, meanwhile, is refusing to go through the security clearance process that the government has offered to him so that he can view an unredacted version of the NSICOP report.\n\nConservatives seem to view the offer as some kind of trap that would prevent Poilievre from questioning or challenging the government on the issue of foreign interference. It's not clear Poilievre wouldn't still be able to use parliamentary privilege to say whatever he wanted inside the House of Commons with impunity.\n\nBut regardless, his refusal to receive a security clearance could be preventing him from taking any of the actions that Lagasse and Carvin suggest.\n\nThe other three opposition leaders -- the NDP's Jagmeet Singh, Green Leader Elizabeth May and Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet of the Bloc Quebecois -- have agreed to view the unredacted NSICOP report. Singh will apparently have his chance on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Tuesday after being the first opposition leader to see the unredacted report, May said she came away feeling less suspicious of her colleagues.\n\nShe later told the CBC's Power & Politics that the unredacted report did not list the names of currently serving Parliamentarians accused of wittingly conspiring with foreign states -- which suggests even NSICOP may not be able to provide much clarity.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, the House voted 320-2 to effectively punt the matter to Justice Hogue (May and fellow Green MP Mike Morrice voted against). Appealing to an independent adjudicator makes some sense, but it might also be months before we know whether Hogue is able to meaningfully clear the air.\n\nKent Roach, a law professor at the University of Toronto, points out that section 13 of the Inquiries Act states that \"no report shall be made against any person until reasonable notice has been given to the person of the charge of misconduct alleged against him and the person has been allowed full opportunity to be heard in person or by counsel.\" That suggests the foreign interference commission could offer due process and then name names.\n\nBut it's also conceivable that national security concerns could still stand in the way of releasing those names publicly. It also stands to reason that Hogue might find she is not able to definitively rule on any parliamentarian's guilt or innocence.\n\nEither way, the cloud over Parliament is going to hang there for a while yet. And one way or another, parliamentarians will end up having to do something about it themselves.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Their findings allege \"pervasive and sophisticated foreign interference\" in Canadian politics, including allegations that multiple unnamed parliament members worked with foreign actors to influence elections and campaigns in 2019 and 2021.\n\nChina was called the most \"prolific actor,\" according to the report.\n\nThe NSICOP says alleged illegal activities by the Parliament members are unlikely to net criminal charges, citing in the report the difficulty of using classified information in judicial proceedings.\n\nOpposition members to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party have pressured the government to release the names of the alleged implicated parliament members. Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre spoke last Wednesday during question time in Parliament, demanding the names be revealed.\n\n\"The National Security Committee indicates there are members of this House who have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments. Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information,\" Poilievre said, \"Who are they?\"\n\nSo far, the government has not committed to releasing the names of the parliamentarians responsible. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc pushed back on releasing the names of the MPs in response to Poilievre.\n\n\"The leader of the opposition knows very well no government, including the government [of] which he was a member, is going to discuss particularities of intelligence information publicly. So he knows better than that,\" LeBlanc said in the House of Commons. \"He would be much more informed than he is now and we would invite him to do so, so he wouldn't stand up and cast aspersions on the floor of the House of Commons without any information whatsoever.\"\n\nThe report comes after previous investigations into foreign involvement in Canadian politics and society. Last September, Trudeau's government charged Quebec Judge Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue to investigate foreign interference in elections after some alleged that China aided in mustering voters against a conservative candidate in Western Canada and helping elect a Liberal in Toronto, according to Politico.\n\nThe previous report from the NSICOP in 2019 did not specifically focus on the federal election that year, and instead was broader in scope, says the report.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He did not commit to naming names.\n\nThe official opposition Conservatives, who polls show are set for an easy win in a national election that must be held by late October 2025, accuse Trudeau of taking a lax approach to security.\n\n\"Certain members of this House acted in the best interest of hostile foreign regimes interfering in Canada's democracy. This is a disgusting betrayal of Canadians who elected us,\" party legislator Jasraj Singh Hallan told the House on Monday.\n\nIn their report last week, the committee of parliamentarians said India and China were the main foreign threats to Canada's democratic institutions.\n\nThe independent inquiry, in an interim report, last month announced it had found evidence of foreign interference in Canada's last two federal elections but said the results of the votes were not affected and the electoral system was robust.\n\nCanada's main spy agency last month said persistent Chinese election meddling had the potential to undermine Canadian democracy.

NSICOP is a group of MPs with top security clearances who issued their report last week.\n\nAmid revelations that the House of Commons contains MPs who have \"wittingly\" collaborated with foreign governments, Parliamentarians have begun openly referring to these unnamed colleagues as \"traitors.\"\n\n\"Name The Traitors\" wrote Independent MP Kevin Vuong in a Wednesday social media post.\n\nWe don't have names but we do know some of the things they allegedly did with either full or partial knowledge of who they were working with.\n\nAnother thing redacted in the report is which foreign governments were the beneficiaries of all this help but the general belief is that China and India are the two countries most involved with meddling in Canadian politics.\n\nThe conservative party is demanding the names of the alleged traitors but the government says it can't release them.\n\nThe worst example cited, with names and details redacted in the published report, concerned a former MP who engaged in communications with a senior official of a foreign intelligence service and tried to arrange a meeting overseas with this official. According to CSIS, confidential information was passed.\n\nThere is no other word for it. This is treason.\n\nThe Conservative party has demanded that the names of alleged \"witting\" politicians who have served foreign states be released. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc has shot back saying no government would agree to release names in cases like this, based on secret intelligence and possibly still under investigation.\n\nMore from the deputy Prime Minister:\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters Tuesday that she takes the issue seriously. She deflected when asked if Canadians have the right to know the identity of the parliamentarians involved.\n\n\"We should recognize this is a new time,\" she said, adding that authoritarians want to undermine democracies by sowing public distrust in government.\n\nFreeland would not commit to releasing names, nor did she agree that \"sunlight\" on the issue would benefit democracy. On Wednesday, after her Liberal party's weekly caucus meeting, she ignored questions on the topic.\n\nI don't want to make assumptions but if the conservatives are calling for names and the Liberals are not, that might tell us something about what is being whispered behind the scenes about who is involved. Keep in mind, Justin Trudeau has already seen the unredacted version of the report.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau already has access to the unredacted version of the NSICOP report and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh will be receiving his confidential briefing shortly. Bloc Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet is in the process of receiving his top-secret security clearance.

For about a week now, the Canadian public has been aware that individuals believed to have colluded with foreign governments may continue to serve as senators, staffers and/or members of Parliament. And for about a week now, those with the power to do something have done nothing.\n\nThe report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) told Canadians that a parliamentarian may have provided \"information learned in confidence from the government to a known intelligence officer of a foreign state.\" It reported that others have accepted \"knowingly or through willful blindness funds or benefits from foreign missions or their proxies.\" And it suggested one or more parliamentarians may be actively conspiring against their own government by \"providing foreign diplomatic officials with privileged information on the work or opinions of fellow Parliamentarians, knowing that such information will be used by those officials to inappropriately pressure Parliamentarians to change their positions.\"\n\nHow is a democracy to function after this sort of intelligence is made public? How can the work of government continue if members of caucus, or maybe even cabinet, are wary of speaking openly out of concern that their remarks might be conveyed to agents of hostile governments? And how can Parliamentarians continue to debate comparably frivolous matters such as taxing the streaming giants, when the first order of government - safeguarding our democracy, and the public's trust therein - could be compromised?\n\nOn Tuesday, all parties in Parliament supported a Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois motion to refer the matter to the foreign interference inquiry being chaired by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue. The gesture punts responsibility over to Justice Hogue, while relieving party leaders of the pressure to actually do something. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre, who has been demanding that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reveal the names of those implicated in the NSICOP report, could seek the necessary security clearance and reveal the names himself in the House, protected by Parliamentary privilege; he has chosen not to. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who has at least indicated he is open to doing something of that nature, has so far taken no action. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May read the unredacted report, but only shared her impressions, saying she has \"no worries about anyone in the House of Commons.\"\n\nFor his part, Mr. Trudeau, who received a draft of the NSICOP report months ago, has declined to take any further action. Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc said disclosing names would not be \"responsible,\" and that it would rob those people of due process considerations.\n\nThe matter is indeed one of competing responsibilities: individual rights versus the public good, and the government's responsibility to the individuals identified in the classified NSICOP report versus its responsibility to millions of Canadians who can no longer trust that their elected representatives are working in their interests. Without names, all of Parliament is effectively implicated. It should be clear where the Prime Minister's foremost obligations lie.\n\nThis government has repeatedly emphasized that intelligence is not evidence, but as The Globe's editorial board pointed out last week, mere intelligence was enough background for Mr. Trudeau to stand in the House in September and accuse the Indian government of orchestrating the death of a Canadian citizen. And due process concerns did not stop Mr. Trudeau from naming and suspending two Liberal MPs in 2014, following accusations from NDP MPs of sexual misconduct.\n\nIn that case, there wasn't a committee reviewing 33,000 pages of intelligence documents, and the investigation came after the suspensions, not before. But the matter was deemed serious enough to identify and remove the MPs in question, even at the risk of their own reputations. It's hard to imagine this government adopting the same refusal to name names it is adhering to now - and professing the same fidelity to due process - if it was publicly disclosed that there were sitting Parliamentarians who had engaged in sexual misconduct, rather than collusion with hostile governments. But perhaps Mr. Trudeau views tolerance of the former as more reputationally damaging than the latter, even if the latter compromises Canada's national security, the daily operations of government, and the faith Canadians can maintain in our federal institutions.\n\nBut Mr. Trudeau isn't the only leader who could take action. Mr. Poilievre likes to talk about how Canada is broken, and surely there is no more pertinent, grave example than a Parliament that has been compromised from the inside. If he, Mr. Trudeau, or Mr. Singh truly appreciates the deleterious effect this continuing ambiguity has on public confidence, they will find a way to provide answers - now. The risks to the individuals named are obvious, but there is a greater public-order risk in both concealing their names, and in permitting them to remain in government.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhead", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roundhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Public_Safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Public Safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_May", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Public_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Public Administration", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/P2TRJLF6NRB6HEO2ZN2J6E2CBI.JPG?auth=eb4f689b0cf8bca2373f5ab0698c1541385237fbfe401cac49ccf5edc46caa61&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Beijing routinely denies accusations of interference.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_LeBlanc", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic LeBlanc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasraj_Hallan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jasraj Hallan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/10_06_2024_19_32_22_4557045.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

And told people what she thought of it.\n\nIn her view, she told reporters, the furor over publicly naming the MPs mentioned in it is \"barking up the wrong tree.\"\n\nLast week's release of a redacted version of the report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians was a bombshell that indicated some parliamentarians have been witting participants in foreign interference - sparking calls for their names to be released.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Green Party Leader said fewer than a handful of current MPs are named in the full, unredacted report.\n\n\"And no one in that fewer than a handful could be described as setting out to knowingly betray Canada in favour of a foreign government,\" Ms. May said.\n\nThat's the judgment of one person, of course. And it does seem to conflict, at least in tone, with the characterizations that came through the redacted version released last week by the committee, known in Ottawa by its acronym, NSICOP.\n\nMs. May is the leader of a small party, and some of her MP colleagues think some of her views are on the fringe, too. But they don't call her a liar. And she actually read the report.\n\nShe did something else: She told the country what she thinks the upshot is.\n\nMore of that, please. Any party leader who wants to tell us the importance of the issue, or take issue with Ms. May's characterization is able to do so. If they have read the full report.\n\nMs. May was able to read the top-secret version because she obtained a security clearance last year, as did NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh. Mr. Singh hasn't yet read the report but expects to Wednesday. Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said he also intends to seek a reading.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre doesn't intend to, and his party argues that if he did read the report, his hands would be tied and he wouldn't be able to talk about it.\n\nBut apparently a leader can talk about it, with constraints. Ms. May talked about it for an hour and nine minutes at Tuesday's press conference. She warned that there were many things she couldn't say, she did provide a few details and her judgment of what it revealed. Other party leaders can, too.\n\nMs. May said that her view of the involvement of current MPs changed dramatically.\n\nThe threat of foreign interference is clearly serious, she said, and one former MP who was not named in the report should be prosecuted for actively passing on information provided in confidence to a foreign intelligence officer.\n\nSome MPs might be \"compromised\" because foreign states might have helped them, but she argued that they did not intentionally work with foreign states against Canada.\n\nIt must be said that the distinction Ms. May drew between complicit and compromised was not crystal clear. The redacted version of the NSICOP report said parliamentarians were \"witting\" participants in foreign interference efforts but Ms. May suggested that all the current MPs mentioned were in a grey area where it wasn't clear that they knew about things like foreign governments paying for busloads of people to pack a nomination meeting.\n\n\"I mean we can go from witting to unwitting to willful blindness,\" she said.\n\nStill, willful blindness sounds bad, doesn't it? It would be worth getting a second opinion. Or more.\n\nMs. May, by the way, said that reading the full report changed her view on referring the issue of MPs' involvement to the public inquiry headed by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, and now she feels parliamentarians have to \"take responsibility for the hot potato.\"\n\nIt's too late for that - MPs voted Tuesday to refer the issue to the inquiry. And the truth is that after all this, an ongoing inquiry into foreign interference can't avoid the question of whether parliamentarians have been complicit. Or willfully blind.\n\nBut Ms. May is right that in the end, all this must be the responsibility or Parliament. The first thing we should expect is that all party leaders read the full, secret report - and tell Canadians the upshot.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.ms", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": ".ms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagmeet_Singh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jagmeet Singh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.mr", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".mr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves-Fran\u00e7ois_Blanchet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Psychic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/Q2F2UBBBAFGJPLX3VADW5HMTGQ.JPG?auth=f9937f1706ff0be62d7213662aff39ded185f0d767c4346bcf83fefb15a9f74c&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

It is clear some foreign governments see Canada as a pretty vulnerable, soft target.\"\n\nWords of wisdom from Elizabeth May that actually make sense.\n\nFor the last week, Parliament Hill has been in a veritable state of intensifying agitation following the tabling of a report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians last Monday that said it was told some Canadian politicians are working with India and China against the interests of the country.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the committee has also seen troubling intelligence that some Parliamentarians are, in the words of the intelligence services, 'semi-witting or witting' participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in our politics,\" read the report.\n\nThe committee and the report did not provide names, or parties, or even whether it was MPs or senators who were involved in illegal behaviour. While media and Canadians generally are crying foul over the lack of information, there are defensible reasons for not naming names. Among other things, identifying politicians involved could put the sources and methods that Canadian intelligence agencies have used to collect information at risk.\n\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois presented a motion to Parliament to ask an inquiry already studying foreign interference in Canadian elections to broaden its mandate and investigate the concerns.\n\nThat inquiry, led by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, already has the security tools and clearances necessary to handle the task.\n\nThe Conservative Party -- whose leader, by choice, doesn't have the security clearance necessary to view the unredacted report -- has called for a list of the names of politicians implicated in the report, as well as further investigation.\n\nMay, who does have the necessary security clearance and has read the report, says the report includes no such list.\n\n\"There is no list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada,\" May told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the report has included some names, but has primarily used redactions to remove identifying details that could be pieced together and used to identify particular federal politicians. May also said she was \"vastly relieved\" after reading the full report, and says one former parliamentarian should be fully investigated.\n\nNo matter: the Conservatives are still using the report -- and its apparently non-existent list -- to campaign on social media. \"Canadians have a right to know the truth about these shocking allegations. Justin Trudeau must release the names and provide the full unredacted information so these allegations can be investigated independently.\"\n\nThe social media postings come complete with a link where you can provide your personal information to the Tory information bank -- and, eventually, leads you to a spot where you can provide a donation.\n\nOther federal parties?\n\nWell, the NDP wants a further inquiry as well -- but don't want it to just look at which federal politicians have been implicated, but also at what, if any, foreign machinations might have benefited Tory leadership candidates.\n\nThe Liberals have said they would support the Bloc motion as well, meaning the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and Bloc were all supporting the motion going into Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nSo where are we?\n\nWell, we're lurching toward a reasonable effort at a haphazard (and probably expensive) solution. If the vote takes place as scheduled and as expected (it's set for after the deadline for this piece), the report from a committee will go to an inquiry, and the political scrimmage will probably cool off until the next report is produced.\n\nThe real question is whether Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's inquiry, if it accepts an expanded mandate, will end up with a more satisfying conclusion than the NSICOP committee did.\n\nFrankly, the same issues will remain: intelligence agencies will continue to hold their sources close, and not want to risk assets to obtain one-time criminal charges or convictions.\n\nShould the inquiry expand, we submit that our elected officials follow May's advice from the top. Quite frankly, most Canadians are generally fed up with federal politicians anyway. And this report is only feeding that animus. What our parties should be focused upon is preventing any further undermining of our democracy.\n\nIt may be less politically satisfying than a witch hunt, but in the end it would prove more useful.", "source": {"uri": "brandonsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brandon Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_May", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Hill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundhead", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roundhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elections in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.brandonsun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/20240611130620-5311182d8a0efe81c5c76e348aa33f868f9bf1b7ec1c0c0bde09f35e410f5f57.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre spoke last Wednesday during question time in Parliament, demanding the names be revealed.\n\n\"The National Security Committee indicates there are members of this House who have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments. Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information,\" Poilievre said, \"Who are they?\"\n\nSo far, the government has not committed to releasing the names of the parliamentarians responsible.

So he knows better than that,\" LeBlanc said in the House of Commons. \"He would be much more informed than he is now and we would invite him to do so, so he wouldn't stand up and cast aspersions on the floor of the House of Commons without any information whatsoever.\"\n\nThe report comes after previous investigations into foreign involvement in Canadian politics and society. Last September, Trudeau's government charged Quebec Judge Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue to investigate foreign interference in elections after some alleged that China aided in mustering voters against a conservative candidate in Western Canada and helping elect a Liberal in Toronto, according to Politico.\n\nThe previous report from the NSICOP in 2019 did not specifically focus on the federal election that year, and instead was broader in scope, says the report.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Or, at least, when they actually do know more details than the general public, they've made commitments not to disclose them.\n\nWe're referring, of course, to the report by the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP), which last week released a heavily redacted report saying that there are unnamed federal politicians who have been colluding with other countries, along with interference in federal leadership campaigns by foreign nations, including the People's Republic of China and India.\n\nThe report was both eye-opening and fundamentally disappointing -- it says that some politicians are sharing information with foreign nations for personal gain, but then (for accurate and defensible reasons) didn't identify anyone. Among other things, identifying politicians involved could put the sources and methods that Canadian intelligence agencies have used to collect information at risk.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois presented a motion to Parliament to ask an inquiry already studying foreign interference in Canadian elections to broaden its mandate and investigate the concerns. That inquiry, lead by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, already has the security tools and clearances necessary to handle the task.\n\nThe Conservative Party -- whose leader, by choice, doesn't have the security clearance necessary to view the unredacted report -- has called for a list of the names of politicians implicated in the report, as well as further investigation.\n\nGreen Party co-Leader Elizabeth May, who does have the necessary security clearance and has read the report, says the report includes no such list.\n\n\"There is no list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada,\" May told reporters.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that the report has included some names, but has primarily used redactions to remove identifying details that could be pieced together and used to identify particular federal politicians. May also said she was \"vastly relieved\" after reading the full report, and says one former parliamentarian should be fully investigated.\n\nNo matter: the Conservatives are still using the report -- and its apparently non-existent list -- to campaign on social media. \"Canadians have a right to know the truth about these shocking allegations. Justin Trudeau must release the names and provide the full unredacted information so these allegations can be investigated independently.\"\n\nThe social media postings come complete with a link where you can provide your personal information to the Tory information bank -- and, eventually, leads you to a spot where you can provide a donation.\n\nOther federal parties?\n\nWell, the NDP wants a further inquiry as well -- but don't want it to just look at which federal politicians have been implicated, but also at what, if any, foreign machinations might have benefited Tory leadership candidates.\n\nThe Liberals have said they would support the BQ motion as well, meaning the Liberals, Conservatives, NDP and BQ were all supporting the motion going into Parliament on Tuesday.\n\nSo where are we?\n\nWell, we're lurching towards a reasonable effort at a haphazard (and probably expensive) solution. If the vote takes place as scheduled and as expected (it's set for after the deadline for this piece), the report from a committee will go to an inquiry, and the political scrimmage will probably cool off until the next report is produced.\n\nThe real question is whether Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's inquiry, if it accepts an expanded mandate, will end up with a more satisfying conclusion than the NSICOP committee did.\n\nFrankly, the same issues will remain: intelligence agencies will continue to hold their sources close, and not want to risk assets to obtain one-time criminal charges or convictions.", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_May", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloc_Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elections in Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberals_(Sweden)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberals (Sweden)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Democratic_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Democratic Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/2386409_web1_IMG_4624.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nOn Tuesday, after a full reading of the report that sent Canadian politics into a tizzy of espionage rumours and speculation, May flatly concluded: \"There is no list of MPs who have shown disloyalty to Canada.\"\n\nMay admitted she had been caught up in the story too, ever since the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) released a report last week that included mention of \"witting\" participation in foreign meddling, by current and past politicians in Ottawa. Like many other MPs, she had been gazing around her, wondering who to trust.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I can say I have no worries about anyone in the House,\" May said. \"I am very comfortable sitting with my colleagues. We will disagree on policy and on many issues (but) I am absolutely relieved.\"\n\nIn one news conference, May actually dispensed some lessons to other leaders on how this incendiary report should be treated. Where Justin Trudeau and his government has left questions lingering, Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has been whipping up doubts about the legitimacy of his fellow parliamentarians.\n\nImmediately after May's news conference, social media was abuzz with questions, including: why hasn't Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc come out and said the same thing? Why has LeBlanc failed to say, as May did, that there's no list of names in the report?\n\nWell, he sort of did. Last week, as Conservatives were escalating their demands for Trudeau to name names of suspect MPs, LeBlanc said: \"The idea that there's a perfect list of names, that is entirely reliable that should be released to the public, is simply irresponsible.\"\n\nLeBlanc has also said that the government doesn't agree with the entire NSICOP report. From what I can tell, reading the lines and in between them, it sounds like this government has the same kind of problems with this report that it discussed during testimony at the inquiry into foreign interference -- namely, that there is continuing disagreement between the Prime Minister's Office and CSIS over when to ring alarm bells on foreign meddling.\n\nMay double-checked what she was allowed to say after she read the report and said -- again, far more clearly than I've heard from government -- why no one can just come right out and release its contents publicly. Doing so, May explained, would compromise intelligence-gathering and possibly endanger the sources of it. She also stressed that \"all parties\" are possible targets of foreign interference and so this shouldn't become the partisan football it has in recent days.\n\nWhich brings us to lessons for Poilievre and the Conservatives. May did what Poilievre has refused to do -- read the report. The longer he continues to refuse the briefings, the more weird it seems. I'm sure even intelligence agencies are baffled -- this man wants to be prime minister but doesn't want to know details of foreign interference?\n\nPoilievre has said he won't be \"trapped\" into keeping secrets for Trudeau's government, but the Greens leader showed you can actually educate yourself on classified information and disclose what you know afterwards -- or at least how you feel about what you read.\n\n\"I think it's always better (to have) as much knowledge as you possibly can get -- of the 360 degrees of your circumstances. More knowledge is better,\" May said.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, who is also being a grown-up about all of this and has requested a similar briefing, also gives another reason Poilievre might want to read the report. Singh said on Monday he wants to know whether any of his MPs are implicated in wilful foreign meddling and if so, they would be ejected from caucus. One would think the Conservative leader would want to seek the same reassurances, since it does seem the recent Conservative leadership race -- the one that elected Poilievre -- targeted by foreign meddling, too.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSome of the huffing and puffing over the \"spy scandal\" has dispersed in recent days. It could be because most parties seem to have decided, in rare agreement, that the NSICOP report should be punted to Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue's foreign-interference inquiry. It could be the chorus of voices from respected intelligence experts, Wesley Wark, or former CSIS director Richard Fadden, that this is not the time for a witch hunt against unnamed parliamentarians.\n\nOr, who knows? It might be May's influence. Later this week, the co-leader of the Greens is having a big party to celebrate her 70th birthday, complete with entertainment. Guests should probably hope May doesn't put a damper on festivities like she did with the spy scandal excitement this week.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"},

Politicians, officials and experts have long cautioned that intelligence is not always akin to evidence.\n\nHowever, the prime minister and opposition leaders can receive the full, unredacted report as long as they obtain proper security clearances.

That would mean Elections Canada, and the separate Commissioner of Canada Elections, would be able to monitor those processes.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDespite those conclusions, when asked whether they would be open to adopting such changes, the Liberals, Conservatives, and New Democrats each defended their current practices.\n\nLeBlanc said last week that

constitutions, rather than having the government of the day involve itself in those efforts.\n\nThe Conservative party's director of communications Sarah Fischer told the Star its processes were more bulletproof than the Liberals' because \"only citizens and permanent residents can purchase a Conservative party membership to vote in a nomination race.\"\n\nFischer pointed to the party's internal

It is shocking to learn that a number of MPs and senators have been acting, effectively, as agents of a foreign power, selling secrets and influence to countries such as China and India in exchange for money and political favours.\n\nWe don't know how many, and we don't know their names. But that is the assessment, based on its reading of the intelligence, of the all-party National Security Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP).\n\nBut just because the odd traitor might be sprinkled among the 430-odd MPs and Senators - and just because they might soon be seeking our votes in an election campaign - that does not mean that we should act in haste. Or, indeed, at all.\n\nTake, for example, those hotheads who have been agitating for someone to name the names: identify the parliamentarians referred to anonymously in the NSICOP report, together with the specifics of what each is alleged to have done and what reason the intelligence agencies have for suspecting them.\n\nIt can't be done. First of all, who would name them? The members of NSICOP can't: they're sworn to secrecy. The Prime Minister can - but won't. The Leader of the Opposition either can't or won't, depending on your point of view: the government won't let him see the names because he refuses to be sworn to secrecy.\n\nBut even if anyone could, they can't. It might compromise investigations. It risks unfairly maligning the innocent. And besides, according to Elizabeth May's reading of the report, those named didn't know they were betraying Canada. (\"I am very comfortable sitting with my colleagues,\" she said, even if some \"may be compromised.\")\n\nLeave it to the RCMP? Can't be done. Any such investigation would be unlikely to result in charges - because the intelligence agencies won't share their information, because if they did it might not stand up in court, because some of the activities involved were not illegal, and because, frankly, they're the RCMP.\n\nWhat about the party leaders, then? Couldn't they be assigned to handle it somehow? Nobody gets named or charged, but just reassigned, expelled from caucus, prevented from running again. Sorry. Anything so dramatic as expulsion would amount to naming them, only without the specifics. People would be free to assume the worst, while those impugned would have no chance to clear their names.\n\nMore likely, the whole thing would be enveloped in fog. These are partisan politicians, after all. Their every instinct would be to prevent any damaging information from coming to light. Everyone would be under suspicion, but no one would face any consequences. Until, inevitably, the names leaked out anyway.\n\nLast, there's the alternative lately seized upon by the party leaders: hand the whole thing over to Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue and the public inquiry on foreign interference. As if she doesn't have enough on her plate already.\n\nThe former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Richard Fadden, is adamant on this point. \"I don't think there's time to do it,\" he told the CBC. \"She's been given unreasonable time frames to begin with.\"\n\nIndeed she has: she was left just two weeks after the close of hearings to complete her initial report, on \"who knew what when,\" a dilemma she evaded by kicking much of the work on that question into her final report.\n\nThat's the one in which she is also supposed to \"examine and assess the capacity of relevant federal departments, agencies, institutional structures and governance processes to ... detect, deter and counter any form of foreign interference,\" as well as \"the mechanisms that were in place to protect the integrity of the 43rd and 44th general elections from foreign interference.\"\n\nOh, and \"recommend any means for better protecting federal democratic processes from foreign interference.\" All by December 31.\n\nAsking her to put all this aside to assess the bona fides of parliamentarians seems like maybe not the best use of her time, particularly when you consider that, at the end of this process, she still wouldn't be allowed to name any names. Essentially she's being asked to redo the NSICOP report.\n\nRound and round we go. Name the names! Leave it to the police! Let the party leaders handle it! Give it to the public inquiry! There is always a reason not to do each, which adds up to plenty of reasons not to do any: as I predicted, no names, no charges, no consequences of any kind.\n\nAt one point the NSICOP report frets that hostile powers \"consider Canada a permissive environment, viewing interference activities as a low-risk, high reward way to pursue strategic interests.\" Got that right.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Official_Opposition_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_May", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth May"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Fadden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Fadden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Security_Intelligence_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Security Intelligence Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_inquiry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public inquiry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Pregnancy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Surnames", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Surnames", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/ERGTZ4LYAREQPMYK3HJPGXIXVU.jpg?auth=04962c4c18bc0257fe153384ba7012cc067b19fb05cfedfa731383ca2f91260f&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-12-31", "textStart": 3890, "textEnd": 3901}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

In brief, the committee reported that when it comes to foreign interference, the call is coming from inside the houses: several parliamentarians may be working with foreign governments in ways that undermine Canada's national security and democratic institutions. Notably, these parliamentarians may have unknowingly received donations from foreign governments, while at least one is alleged to have passed confidential information to foreign agents.\n\nNSICOP's report has been met with outrage and demands that the government name the parliamentarians in question. We agree that the situation is serious and presents a clear danger to Canadian democracy. Yet, calls for the government to openly name names ignore the risks involved.\n\nThe most obvious risk is that disclosing too much, too soon, would disrupt both criminal and intelligence investigations. Foreign agents and proxies, possibly under surveillance as a part of much wider national security investigation, would learn that their activities are being monitored. These individuals could then go dark or flee the country, eliminating the chance for prosecution. Worse, having learned they are under investigation, these foreign agents and proxies might be able to identify sensitive sources and methods used to gather information.\n\nLiberals will not release names of parliamentarians accused of collaborating with hostile foreign states\n\nSecond, simply naming the parliamentarians would not be enough - there would be demands to know what they've each done to warrant being named and calls to see evidence against them. This, too, would expose the tools used by the intelligence agencies, undermining not only current investigations, but their use in future ones as well.\n\nThird, although it is doubtful NSICOP would be so bold in their assessments if they did not trust in the assessments they have read, intelligence is not evidence. Such a public denunciation without clear evidence to back it up could ruin lives and reputations.\n\nSo what can be done? The answer lies with party leaders, who have the ability to address these allegations in a way that balances action, accountability, and the security of information.\n\nLeaders from all parties should agree to be briefed on the intelligence about parliamentarians who may have been compromised. They could do so by being made privy councillors if they are not already, and then being granted a security clearance for the purpose of reviewing the intelligence in question. Once they have reviewed the intelligence, they should judge what actions should be taken regarding the parliamentarians who belong to their parties.\n\nCampbell Clark: Even the spies think the rush to name foreign interference collaborators is rash\n\nThe actions available to party leaders could range from giving those who acted unwittingly with a warning and resources to avoid getting embroiled with foreign powers in the future, to removing them from committees, to expelling them from the party caucus, thereby forcing them to sit as independents and preventing them from running under their party's banner during the next election.\n\nIf a leader judges that a parliamentarian should be expelled from caucus, a high-level explanation would be that the intelligence warranted this outcome. The expelled parliamentarian would still be free to deny that they have been compromised in any way, and they may never face any criminal charges.\n\nThis would, of course, still damage their reputation and likely end their parliamentary career. But parliamentarians have been expelled from caucus for far less. If allegations of fraud warrant expulsion from caucus, as they have in the past, then surely concerns about colluding with foreign powers do, too.\n\nTo put it bluntly, nobody is owed a seat in caucus or in Parliament, and party leaders have a duty to ensure that their members are not undermining national security or our democratic institutions for personal gain. If nothing is done, furthermore, compromised parliamentarians may be emboldened, and future politicians could fail to appreciate the consequences of cozying up to foreign governments.\n\nDealing with senators who may have been compromised will be more difficult. Given that the Senate is now divided into various groups and non-affiliated senators, and only one party sits in the same caucus as members of Parliament, addressing the problem in the upper house presents a challenge. Allegations of foreign interference should force the Senate to find ways to keep its house in order.\n\nRelying on party leaders to deal with potentially compromised parliamentarians is not ideal. This approach will not satisfy those calling for all the intelligence and allegations to be made public, nor will it afford the suspected parliamentarians with due process or a fair hearing. But if the choice is between some accountability and safeguards within Parliament or none at all, we should demand that our party leaders act, while protecting our national security investigations.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carleton_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carleton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privy_council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privy council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Campbell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_clearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security clearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upper house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/CM5CW3ZSEBGWFKSRQ5QTUNMXAI.JPG?auth=a2b394fdd4830068498588518a2f9677cf6638eddeec7586115e8fc4b33933da&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Through much of its history, the Great White North has been a place of great momentum rather than great advances. Living comfortably under the United States' defense envelope through the Cold War and on to today, Canada has been, for the most part, peaceful and uneventful, populated by people with a reputation for politeness and a government that was to the left of America's. In general, things went along pretty well.\n\nThat is changing now. Canada's Parliament has been hit with allegations of, yes, treason, and Prime Minister Justin \"Castro\" Trudeau is looking distinctly uncomfortable about the whole thing - while the Canadian Conservatives' Pierre Poilievre is hammering the PM over the affair.\n\nThe new report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) is the first to suggest that lawmakers in Canada's parliament may have helped foreign actors meddle in political campaigns and leadership races. Heightened anxiety in Ottawa about foreign interference comes in the middle of historic global elections where factors such as artificial intelligence and emboldened foreign powers are testing the resilience of democratic systems.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has been on the defensive since the allegations broke Monday. Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre is calling on the government to name names.\n\n\"The national security committee indicates there are members of this House that have knowingly worked for foreign hostile governments,\" Poilievre said Wednesday. \"Canadians have a right to know who and what is the information -- who are they?\"\n\nLooking at this whole thing as a citizen of the United States, one has to admit it all has a familiar ring to it. So what is the evidence?\n\nThe all-party NSICOP said Monday that it has reviewed intelligence that suggests \"semi-witting or witting\" parliamentarians have worked with foreign missions to mobilize voters during a political campaign; have taken cash \"knowingly or through willful blindness\" from foreign missions or their proxies; and have shared privileged information with foreign diplomatic officials.\n\nThe committee with top-security clearance said it based its findings on more than 4,000 documents and some 1,000 pieces of evidence. Its report said China remains the largest foreign interference threat to Canada with India the second.\n\n\"Treason\" may be a bit of a stretch here. Treason is normally defined as:\n\nThe offense of attempting by overt acts to overthrow the government of the state to which the offender owes allegiance\n\nThese acts appear to be attempts to influence the government but not to overthrow it. Still, that's a bit of pedantry over a serious issue, and that issue is the integrity of Canada's elections. And again, this all has a familiar ring to it.\n\nSee Related: WATCH: Canadian Conservative PM Candidate Gives Master Class in Handling Activist Disguised as 'Reporter'\n\nCanadian Senator Speaks in Cringey 'Gen Z' Language As She Proposes to Allow 16-Year-Olds to Vote\n\nIt's not a huge stretch to think this could be a trial run for those same outside actors to try to influence an American election. The cultural similarities between the United States and Canada make Canada the perfect testing ground for any kind of geopolitical shenanigans. What's not clear is what these outside actors are trying to accomplish, because this issue sure seems like it's handed Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre a great big political stick with which to whack Trudeau and the Liberal Party.\n\nWhat's really interesting about all this is the Trudeau government's reluctance to name names. As Poilievre points out, there is evidence that members of Canada's House of Commons are implicated in this scandal, but the government isn't releasing names. Why? One would think that, at the very least, the affiliation of those persons should be known, and if Canada's government works anything like the current United States government, then we can be sure that if these people were from the Conservative Party, their names would have been made public tout suite. But, since they haven't been released, we look to the north (or in my case, to the east), Canadians look to Ottawa, and we wait to see what happens next.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Poilievre", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Poilievre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Trudeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Trudeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fidel Castro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29th_Canadian_Ministry", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "29th Canadian Ministry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Commons of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_Canada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senate of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Conservatism", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/11/7073c5fe-2161-442c-ac9d-c369e5dff64b.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nMcGuinty urged his fellow parliamentarians -- as well as Canadians as a whole -- to read the report in its entirety and understand that foreign states are worming their way into NGOs, boardrooms, media coverage and other elements of society.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"The stakes are huge,\" McGuinty said Wednesday in a lengthy back-and-forth with reporters on Parliament Hill.\n\n\"Our democracy is on the line, our rule of law is on the line, transnational repression is on the line, our diaspora communities are on the line and being victimized. All of this is called out. It's a major clarion call for action.\"\n\nSince NSICOP released its public report, the information it contains about current and former MPs has raised repeated questions about who the MPs are, what the intelligence specifically says about them and why the public doesn't have the right to know in far greater detail what might be going on.\n\nMcGuinty said that issue is only a very narrow strip of a much broader review, and it is \"unfortunate\" there's been so much focus on that piece.\n\nWhat's been made public in the report is the product of hours and hours of deliberating over every sentence, every line, to provide the broadest picture possible for Canadians, he said -- in a responsible way.\n\n\"We cannot play with national security and intelligence. There are people's lives and careers and reputations at stake here. We have folks in the field, we have sources and methods, we have relationships with foreign governments, we have sources of information from other governments in the Five Eyes and elsewhere,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not a game.\"\n\nStill, the furor led to the government offering opposition party leaders the appropriate security clearance so they could read the unredacted version as well.\n\nGreen Party Leader Elizabeth May was cleared Monday, read the report and said Tuesday what she's seen leads her to conclude that a \"few\" MPs may be compromised but not at a level that would be considered disloyal to Canada.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh is expected to read the report later Wednesday and discuss his perspective on Thursday.\n\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has so far declined to receive the required security clearance, with his office previously saying he does not want to be sworn to secrecy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe -- as well as other party leaders -- could rise in the House of Commons chamber to say everything they know from reading the unredacted report without fear of prosecution.\n\nMembers of NSICOP can't do that.\n\nMay has said she doesn't believe the few names published in the report she saw merit being made public at this time.\n\nNSICOP's work was based on the committee's review of thousands of pages of intelligence documents, as well as interviews with and briefings from Canada's top security officials.\n\nIts assessment includes \"interference activities in democratic processes and institutions were conducted by foreign diplomats, intelligence officers, state proxies and co-optees, and targeted all orders of government, civil society groups, ethnocultural communities, community organizations, business persons and journalists.\"\n\nAmong the examples: front-organizations set up by China specifically for foreign interference activities; the Indian government having a known proxy at work in Canada through a network of contacts that includes journalists, community members and some MPs; intelligence on political staffers passing on confidential information to foreign state contacts; and meddling in Conservative party leadership races.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMcGuinty said there needs to be an adult and non-partisan debate over how to counteract all of it -- but that an easy place to begin would be for the government to simply implement the committee's recommendations, not just from this report but past ones.\n\n\"We've called out the government where they've been weak. We've been very clear about it. We've given them a pathway forward. We've been very clear about that,\" he said.\n\n\"Now, it's up to the government, and for that matter, other political party leaders to act together.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType":

Concerns around the issue have intensified amid the bombshell allegations contained in the unclassified version of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) report released last week. The report said a number of federal politicians, whom it declined to identify, are collaborating with countries such as India and China.\n\nInitially, Mr. Poilievre and Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois Leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet both rejected offers for the access to classified reports because they said it would muzzle their public efforts to hold the government to account. However, in the last week, top intelligence officials have said that secrecy rules would not prevent leaders from acting on the information they receive. On Tuesday, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May held a lengthy news conference detailing what she learned from the classified report.\n\nNo current MPs wittingly collaborated with foreign powers, Green Leader Elizabeth May says after reading classified report\n\nIn the wake of those developments, Mr. Blanchet agreed to receive the briefing and on Tuesday said he is in the process of getting clearance.\n\nThe Conservative Leader though remains unconvinced. The party confirmed he will not get the briefing on Wednesday.\n\nThe report from NSICOP says foreign actors targeted Conservative Party leadership races. The specifics are redacted in the report's public version, however it says there were \"two specific instances\" where officials from the People's Republic of China allegedly interfered in the leadership races. It also says India allegedly interfered in one Tory leadership race.\n\nThe report spans intelligence from September, 2018 to March, 2024. In that time the Conservatives held two leadership races. One in 2020, won by Erin O'Toole, and another in 2022, which Mr. Poilievre won.\n\nOn their way into caucus, MPs were tight-lipped when asked for their thoughts on the leader's decision not to be briefed on the classified information.\n\nThe party sent a staffer outside the Parliamentary buildings to monitor the Globe's questions of Conservative MPs.\n\nCollusion allegations must go to foreign interference inquiry, Opposition parties say\n\nThe only MP who spoke on the topic with the Globe was Michael Chong, the party's foreign affairs critic, who was himself a target of Beijing's foreign interference. He was adamant that Mr. Poilievre can't get the classified briefing because he won't be able to act on what he learns.\n\n\"It would tie the leader's hands behind his back. It would prevent him from disclosing the names to anyone else, and therefore he would be unable to take action. That's why we're calling for the names to be made public,\" Mr. Chong said.\n\nRather than having their leader briefed, the Conservatives have said the foreign interference inquiry should review the allegations in the NSICOP report and then publicly release \"findings of fact\" on each case involving a current or past Parliamentarian.\n\nThe Conservatives are the only caucus that have subjected themselves to the Reform Act, meaning that their MPs and Senators decide whether or not to remove a caucus member, rather than the Leader.\n\nOver the weekend, Mr. Chong told CTV's Question Period with Vassy Kapelos that the Reform Act prevents Mr. Poilievre from acting without his caucus approving it. That is a stretch, according to Kory Teneycke, a top Conservative strategist, as well as an academic with expertise in the Parliamentary system and defence policy.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Teneycke, who is Ontario Premier Doug Ford's top adviser and campaign manager, said Mr. Poilievre should get the briefing because ultimately he is responsible for what is happening in his own party and caucus.\n\n\"I don't think it's good for party leadership to outsource those judgments to other people,\" Mr. Teneycke said. \"Everyone needs to clean up their own house.\"\n\nHe also said that he believes pointing to the Reform Act as a reason for Mr. Poilievre not to be briefed amounts to a \"false construct\" because Mr. Poilievre still has full control over nomination approvals and could still advise caucus that someone needs to be removed.\n\n\"It's an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, and I think they should welcome it,\" Mr. Teneycke said.\n\nEven though it would make some public commentary more challenging, Carleton University associate professor Philippe Lagass\u00e9 said on balance the Conservative Leader should get the briefing to ensure he has the information needed to manage his own party. He urged all party leaders to get informed and not outsource their responsibility to Justice Hogue.\n\n\"By not getting the briefing, the Conservatives may be the only party that isn't fully informed about who may be wittingly or unwittingly aligning themselves with a foreign power within their own caucus,\" he said.\n\nHowever, he added that so far the Liberals have not clarified what if any actions they have taken since receiving the classified version of the report in March.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [],

UltraBasic will allow Canadians to travel \"without paying for additional services they don't value.\"\n\nHello and welcome to Air Liberal! I hope you're having a wonderful day. How can I make it better?\n\nHi, I have a question about foreign interference. I saw the news that Canada's intelligence services have information that some federal politicians have collaborated with foreign governments. It was in that report from a committee of parliamentarians. The all-party group believes that some Canadian politicians may be working for countries such as India and China, and that those foreign governments may be working for them.\n\nYes sir, you're referring to the report from NSICOP, the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians.\n\nThat's the one. These allegations are shocking. Incomprehensible. Unprecedented. I don't have the words. What are you going to do about it?\n\nI can assure you that we are doing everything we can to make life better for the middle class and those working hard to join it.\n\nWhat?\n\nSorry, wrong talking points. What I meant to say is that we take these serious allegations seriously and are treating them with the utmost seriousness. But before we go any further, I see that you are flying on our UltraBasic Democracy fare.\n\nWhat?\n\nIt's the minimal democratic service. For voters who really don't care, and politicians who can't really be bothered.\n\nI thought I was on the Canada Is The World's Greatest Democracy fare.\n\nOh no, sir. That's no longer available.\n\nLook, I'm just hoping that you can tell me what you're planning on doing to ensure that the people representing us are not \"semi-witting or witting\" agents of foreign governments - that's how NSICOP put it - or reaping financial gain or electoral advantage from colluding with them. And if they were, there would be, like, you know, consequences. A way to stop them. Something. Anything.\n\nThat's an excellent idea sir. You should call the RCMP.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis whole matter is really out of our hands. That's why even though our government received the NSICOP report in March ...\n\nWhoa, you've known about this since March? Why haven't you done anything?\n\nWe are acting deliberately. That it looks like we are not acting at all is proof of our maturity and seriousness.\n\nHow many of your MPs are named in the report? MPs from other parties? Ministers?\n\nWe can't say.\n\nDo you plan on doing anything with the intelligence gathered by our intelligence services?\n\nMy talking points say I'm supposed to give an answer that is simultaneously positive, obtuse and non-committal, but it's been a long day. So I'll just say: No, not really. Not if we can avoid it.\n\nI'm confused. Isn't the goal of gathering intelligence to gain knowledge so as to act on it?\n\nBut if we use the intelligence we have on foreign interference in our politics, that will reveal to our enemies what we know, and how we know it.\n\nAgain, I'm not following you. Investigation and prosecution will take years, and probably can't be done without revealing all that secret intelligence. Meanwhile, right now, we have a report from a group of parliamentarians, chaired by a Liberal MP, that even in the redacted form released to the public says a number of unnamed politicians appear to be on the take from foreign governments.\n\nWe don't want to spark a witch hunt.\n\nBut unless we investigate these unprecedented allegations, and act on what is found, our whole system of government, and every politician in it, will be under a cloud of suspicion. Isn't a loss of faith in Canadian institutions exactly what some of our enemies want? And if there's rising public cynicism, won't its main target be the Liberal government?\n\nWe hadn't really thought about that last bit. So maybe our attitude will change. But our starting point is that police should handle it. If time passes and nobody is charged, maybe we'll all just move on. We also announced on Monday that we're willing to support an opposition move to refer the matter to the inquiry probing foreign interference. Just so long as it doesn't name names.\n\nI don't get it. I thought you said you wanted to take this seriously.\n\nLook, even if some unnamed politicians are trading favours with a foreign power, they're probably just backbench MPs and senators. They have almost no power and they don't know much.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_and_Intelligence_Committee_of_Parliamentarians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WestJet", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WestJet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Mounted_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Backbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign_Ministries", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Foreign Ministries", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Intelligence", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/v2/MFPPAEGAKJCHZLPORFYQWM3RTI.jpg?auth=50addae06f821426a1d3e18023ac994ccea70c91e5ac62a50d331c5e4432442b&width=560&quality=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9640044", "eventUri": "eng-9640044", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Because of those concerns, the Official Opposition agreed to fast-track the legislation, which the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois and NDP also agreed to. It received just six days of study at committee.\n\nWhile many parts of the bill will take effect soon after royal assent, the government said it needs a year to establish what it is calling the Foreign Influence Transparency Registry and the office that will oversee it. Such a registry has long been recommended by experts and while the government initially resisted implementing one, it now acknowledges it is \"increasingly considered an international best practice.\"\n\nA growing number of reports and reviews have sounded the alarm on foreign interference in Canadian politics. The first report from the public inquiry into the matter led by Justice Marie-Jos\u00e9e Hogue, released in early May, called it \"a stain on our electoral process.\"\n\nLast week, a report from the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP) warned that the \"threat of foreign interference is pervasive and persistent\" and cautioned that Canada's democratic processes and institutions are \"an easy target.\" That report also said intelligence services believe some parliamentarians are \"semi-witting or witting\" participants in foreign-interference efforts.\n\nAfter Thursday's vote in the House, Bill C-70 will go to the Senate where its leadership has also agreed to fast-track the bill and hold a final vote before they rise at the end of the month.\n\n\"We have a gun to our head to get this done,\" Senator Hassan Yussuff told Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc and Justice Minister Arif Virani during a Wednesday Senate committee hearing on the bill.\n\nMr. Yussuff, a member of the Independent Senators Group and a former labour leader, told The Globe and Mail that given the bill's complexity, it's incumbent on senators \"to study it in its totality, in terms of its broader implication.\"\n\nHe said he has sympathy for the desire to have the registry in place before the next election but noted that the Senate didn't choose the timeline.\n\n\"I don't want us to shortcut,\" he said.\n\nNSICOP chair and Liberal MP David McGuinty said last week's report is a \"major clarion call for action.\"\n\nHe stressed that the risks go well beyond Parliament and said there are also concerns about provincial and municipal politics, universities, boardrooms, community associations and non-governmental associations across Canadian society.\n\n\"Our democracy is on the line, our rule of law is on the line, transnational repression is on the line, our diaspora communities are on the line and being victimized,\" he told reporters outside a Liberal caucus meeting on Wednesday.\n\n\"We cannot play with national security,\" he said. \"There are people's lives and careers and reputations at stake.\"\n\nThe Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) and five other civil-liberties groups warned last week that rushing the legislation meant to stymie foreign interference risks enacting a law that will violate the Charter.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, two of the association's directors, Shakir Rahim and Ana\u00efs Bussi\u00e8res McNicoll, said they have concerns with the bill that have not been fixed through the House amendment process.\n\nIn particular, Ms. Bussi\u00e8res McNicoll said the organization is concerned by how much is left undecided in the legislation creating the foreign-influence registry. \"It uses very broad and basic definitions and leaves crucial questions to future regulations,\" she said.\n\nFor example, she said the exact scope of the registry, who and what arrangements will be captured by it, and what type of information people will have to provide to it all remains to be determined.\n\nAnother section of the law, creates a new sabotage offence under the Criminal Code, aimed at protecting domestic essential infrastructure - which is not related to foreign interference.\n\nThe CCLA and several other experts said in May that the provision is too broad and could infringe on legitimate protest. But instead of narrowing that section, Mr. Rahim said the House committee broadened it by including protections for construction of essential infrastructure.\n\nHe said the new offence does not adequately protect the right to protest and said it will give police more powers to shut down demonstrations, such as the 2022 blockade of the capital or past pipeline blockades.\n\nMr. Rahim said he supports addressing risks to Canada's democracy, but \"the solution to this problem can't be at the expense of the civil liberties that are important for us to protect.\"\n\nIn the House Wednesday, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May said she is concerned that \"we've gone perhaps recklessly quickly in bringing the bill forward.\" Still, her office later confirmed that she will vote in favour of Bill C-70.\n\nNDP MP and public-safety critic Alistair MacGregor said his party agreed to rush the bill despite wanting more time for review because of the threat of foreign interference.\n\nThe window to get the registry in place is so narrow, he said, that it factored into the House public-safety committee's decision not to make the office responsible for overseeing the registry independent of the government. Had the committee passed such an amendment, Mr. MacGregor said it was told that it would take even longer to establish.\n\nConservative MP and foreign-affairs critic Michael Chong welcomed what he called the government's belated action on the issue.\n\n\"Bill C-70 is a much-needed response to the existential threat to our democracy from foreign interference,\" he said in the House.\n\nWhen asked by The Globe on Wednesday if the government is committed to having the legislation in place prior to the next election, Mr. LeBlanc said \"I very much hope so.\"\n\n\"We're going to certainly move expeditiously,\" he said. \"Ideally it would be in place before the next election, absolutely.\"", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"},

So far, they have not leaked, but they may yet.\n\nThe Liberal government's inaction on foreign interference, particularly by China, led to a damaging series of leaks from the intelligence community, which forced the Liberals to call a public inquiry and bring forward legislation to create a foreign agent registry.\n\nIt appears the judge overseeing the inquiry will be asked to look at the evidence concerning potentially disloyal politicians.

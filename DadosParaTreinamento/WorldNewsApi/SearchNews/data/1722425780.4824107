Kharkiv region. Russia attacked the town of Derhachi, in northeastern Kharkiv oblast, or region, with guided aerial bombs on June 26, regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said. Located eight miles from Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city of Kharkiv, Derhachi saw private homes hit in the bombing.

Ukraine and Russia made a 90-for-90 prisoner-of-war (POW) exchange on June 25, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed. Those released include Ukrainian servicemen from the National Guard, conventional military units, Territorial Defense Force and Border Guard. They are men who defended the city of Mariupol and the Chornobyl nuclear power plant, and fought on the Kherson, Donetsk, Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia fronts. \u201cWe remember all our people in Russian captivity,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cWe continue to work for the release of each and every one of them.\u201d This was the 53rd official POW exchange between the combatants; it was mediated by the United Arab Emirates. Russia has sent 10,000 recent immigrants to the Ukrainian front lines, said Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, the equivalent of the United States FBI, during a conference on June 27. The country has made military service a condition of obtaining citizenship without having to meet the language or five-year residence requirement. But, in sweeps across the country, authorities have identified 30,000 newly-minted citizens who had failed to register for military duty, including the 10,000 already mobilized. According to Bastrykin, the recently naturalized immigrants are digging trenches and building fortifications, rather than engaging in combat, in Ukraine, but Russia\u2019s frontline casualties are soaring. The small territorial gains it has made in Ukraine over the past few months have come at high human cost, with an estimated 1,200 Russian soldiers dying each day during the month of May, according to British and other western intelligence reports. This brings the total estimated Russian military casualties since the start of its invasion of Ukraine to 500,000.

According to Sokorenko, this decision marks a precedent for an international court to find Russia responsible for systemic violations in the Ukrainian territories it occupies. \u201cThis is a vital step toward bringing the aggressor to international legal responsibility,\u201d Sokorenko said. With this ruling, supported by evidence presented by Kyiv, the ECHR recognized the illegal detentions of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars perpetrated by the Russian occupation authorities, the ongoing forcible Russian naturalization of Ukrainian citizens in Crimea, continuous discrimination against Crimean Tatars and violation of the rights of political prisoners and their ill-treatment. Ukraine\u2019s ombudsman for human rights Dmytro Lubinets noted that this decision is the result of a decade of work following a complaint filed by Kyiv against Moscow in 2014. \u201cThis decision is proof that the Russian Federation is vilely lying about the observance of human rights in the occupied Crimea!\u201d the ombudsman added. Denmark has pledged an additional grant of 4.7 million Euros ($5 billion) to Ukraine\u2019s Energy Support Fund, the Ministry of Energy ministry of Ukraine announced on June 26. The funds are slated for repairing and rebuilding critical infrastructure facilities in Mykolaiv and Kharkiv oblasts, frontline areas where tens of thousands of civilians remain. \u201cDenmark became the first sponsor of the Fund, contributing to the restoration of the Ukrainian energy sector back in April 2022,\u201d minister of energy Herman Galushchenko said. \u201cIt is especially needed for the frontline regions whose energy facilities are subject to day-to-day hostile attacks.\u201d The Energy Support Fund for Ukraine is a vital tool for coordinating international assistance to keep Ukraine\u2019s energy sector operational. Since its inception in Spring 2022, countries such as Germany, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Austria have contributed or pledged a total of 551 million Euros ($590 million) to the fund. Culture Front. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced on June 25 that it has invited Ukrainian journalist Mstyslav Chernov to join its ranks. Chernov won an academy award this year for his feature documentary film \u201c20 Days in Mariupol.\u201d Chernov, alongside field photographer Yevhen Maloletka and producer Vasylisa Stepanenko were among the last remaining reporters in the city of Mariupol when it came under siege by invading Russian forces in February 2022, poignantly capturing the unfolding horrors. If he accepts the invitation to join the Academy, Chernov will have a voice in selecting winning entries in the Best Documentary Feature category. Britain\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts opened a Ukraine-dedicated exhibit titled \u201cIn the Eye of the Storm,\u201d in London on June 28. The exhibit celebrates Ukrainian artists of the modernist period, 1900 \u2013 19030\u2019s, and features some 65 works by artists such as Kazymyr Malevych, Sonia Delaunay and Alexandra Exter. \u201cThe modernist movement in Ukraine unfolded against a backdrop of collapsing empires, the First World War, the fight for independence, and the eventual establishment of Soviet Ukraine,\u201d the exhibition brief reads. \u201cDespite such profound upheaval, this became a period of bold artistic experimentation, and true flourishing of art, literature and theatre in Ukraine.\u201d The exhibit is on view until October 13.

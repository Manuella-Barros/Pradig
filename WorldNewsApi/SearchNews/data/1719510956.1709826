{"id": 223708072, "title": "Divorce and children: \u2018It\u2019s an unregulated Wild West\u2019 \u2013 How  outdated court system is causing hurt and heartac", "text": "In a recent article in this newspaper on family law in Ireland, we wrote about the inability of the family law system to meet not only the needs of parents but also of children. While some families try to resolve family breakdown matters outside of the courts through mediation, many are left with no option but to seek recourse through the courts. This can result in a family\u2019s loss of control \u2014 with decisions being made by a judge and aspects of everyday family life becoming court-ordered. The question of a child being heard should not depend on a parent having the resources When fathers and mothers find themselves faced with an adversarial legal system, their expectations of achieving justice and resolution can be shattered by the stark reality of how the system currently operates. There have been elements of positive change on the legal front. Arguably, some of these changes, at best, fall short of achieving the desired results \u2014 and, at worst, can serve to make a bad situation worse. One area where this is apparent is around children. In Ireland, children are not party to family law proceedings but decisions made are supposed to be in the child\u2019s best interests. These decisions directly impact the lives of children not only in the moment, but also in the long term. \u200bHearing the voice of the child in family law cases \u2014 a critical aspect of ensuring a child\u2019s best interests are wholly considered \u2014 is something Ireland has committed to doing at international level. The Irish family law courts are also bound to do so under Article 42A of the Irish Constitution. In practice, however, the existing legal framework is not applied with any consistency. Not only has it resulted in a shoehorning of the voice of the child into an existing archaic, dysfunctional and under-resourced system, but it has arguably led to mere lip service being given to the \u2018best interests\u2019 principle. For example, a judge hearing a family law case can order a Section 32 (1) (a) or Section 47 child welfare report, which may include the voice of the child, that will support them in making final decisions. Children\u2019s best interests are not prioritised in the current system Our research, commissioned and published by One Family in December 2022, raised serious concerns regarding how the voices of young children aged up to six years are represented in Irish family law proceedings. The suitability of court assessors tasked with the role of presenting the voice of the child to the courts was open to question, as was the quality of the reports being produced, the qualifications and efficiency of those who conduct the reports, the overall availability of assessors, the high costs involved and the extent to which these reports are in fact valued by judges. Added to all of this is the fact that the practice of conducting the child welfare report is wholly unregulated. Unlike many other professions who must be regulated and are subject to external accreditation, the practice of writing these child welfare reports is not. So there is no quality assurance or oversight. There is also the significant issue of cost. In an already highly inflated system, many of these experts charge mothers and fathers extortionate amounts of money to undertake the job. The question of whether or not a child will be heard \u2014 something they have a constitutional right to \u2014 should not be dependent on a parent having the resources to fund it. Aside from this, the system itself is desperately under-resourced. It has been likened to a conveyor belt where long lists of family cases get moved along (often without resolution or conclusion) and where time and attention to detail cannot be honoured. With no quick fixes, court orders become the script by which some families and children must live by. The system is not equipped to deal with the myriad of complex challenges of contested separated parenting. As a result, mothers, fathers and inevitably, children, get lost and indeed become invisible. Our family law system was not created with children in mind. Whatever about adults\u2019 needs, children\u2019s best interests are not and cannot be prioritised in the current system. It is an outdated and under-resourced institution that, in its current configuration, cannot keep pace with the fast-changing developmental needs of children. While a system of reform that is well overdue is under way, it is a shame to say we are not giving the best to our children. We can only hope that better is yet to come and children will be part of an adequately resourced family law system. We owe them that much at the very least. \u200bDr Aisling Parkes, School of Law, University College Cork Dr Simone McCaughren, Trinity College Dublin A child\u2019s view: \u201cI was desperate to have my voice heard \u2014 this decision would impact my life\u201d As a child growing up, your family is your world. Travelling to school together, chatting about your day over dinner or homework, doing these daily activities was a normal feature of my childhood. When your parents decide they can\u2019t live together any more, for whatever reason, what you know as family falls apart and life changes significantly. You worry about what it means, what the future holds. Your childhood is disrupted, filled with a loss of control and uncertainty. You compare yourself to your friends and their families. Instead of planning sleepovers or going places with your friends, you plan life around the other parent \u2014 for me, that was my mother. My parents separating was a relief in the end. The house of tension, fighting and shouting all of a sudden became quiet. Instead the fighting moved behind the doors of the courtroom. I only ever knew the courtrooms I saw on TV and had an image in my mind of my mom and dad sitting across from each other in front of a judge \u2014 it wasn\u2019t too far from the truth, it seems. I feel like I went into a very dark place in those days. I had zero support \u2014 no one to talk to. My school didn\u2019t know about it; I was embarrassed to talk about it with friends. My dad did his best while coping with his own emotional pain. \u2018I told my dad to tell the judge I wanted to speak to him\u2019 I recall one day in particular where my dad came home and said, \u201cYour mother wants custody of you and your brothers.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d I asked. \u201cShe wants you all to live with her.\u201d My father was and is my world. He brought us up; he was always there for us from the beginning no matter what. He supported us financially, academically and as much as he could emotionally. My mother was absent a lot physically, but more so emotionally, for reasons of her own. As a child, my relationship with her was challenging and I couldn\u2019t understand how a judge who had never met me could ultimately decide I should go and live with her. My little brothers were too young to understand \u2014 I took them under my wing after my mother left. I was desperate to have my voice heard in all of this \u2014 in such an important decision which would impact my life. I felt powerless, I had no control. With fire in my belly, I told my dad to tell the judge I wanted to speak to him. He told me would ask his barrister. Dad\u2019s barrister said, \u201cShe can\u2019t.\u201d I asked him if I could write the judge a letter. I was again told \u201cNo \u2014 the judge doesn\u2019t speak to children.\u201d But this decision was about me and my life. Not only did I not have a say in the break-up of my family, but now I had no say in what was going to happen next. I distinctly remember telling my dad I would kill myself if the judge ordered us to live with my mother. I was 12. Dad told me he was advised that the courts favour mothers. I was terrified, as was he. In the end, we were ordered to see our mother every Saturday and to stay with her once a month. Was there a choice? No. I had to go? Yes. Did I want to go? It was irrelevant. Did I want to spend some Saturdays doing what children do, playing with my friends or just lounging around watching TV? Yes. But this wasn\u2019t an option for me; this was the way it was. This was the deal. A deal made by someone I imagined to be a stern, scary-looking adult in a black cloak and white wig somewhere in a wooden courtroom. Every Saturday morning I would wake up with a pain in my tummy. Every Saturday evening I was emotionally drained and mentally upset. This all manifested in me developing an unhealthy relationship with food, first emotional eating followed by not eating at all. I was a deeply unhappy child. Eventually, as I got older, I stopped going to see my mom. Horrible and all as that sounds, it was a relationship that couldn\u2019t be fixed. Now as a mother to children of my own, I see friends going through similar challenges with their children in the family law courts. I listen to them about their experiences, and the experiences of their children. I hear about \u201cvoice of the child\u201d reports and the problems associated with them and I feel myself asking has anything really changed since I was a child? The system needs to understand the impact of not having a meaningful say in the process is not something that is momentary or fleeting \u2014 it is lifelong. If I had some involvement in those key decisions back then, the result may not have been any different in relation to the decisions that were made. But it might have made a difference for me. It may not have led to hours spent in therapy to try and heal the emotional pain inflicted, and the feeling of powerlessness over my own future. A father\u2019s view: \u201cIt\u2019s an unregulated Wild West, an abomination which needs to be exposed\u201d As a young fella I remember being asked in an aptitude test why the State took an interest in marriage. I was flummoxed. I thought marriage was about love and kids and forever. Little did I know. Having since been through the mill of the family law system, I have learned that it makes a mockery of the supposed constitutional sacredness of the \u201cfamily\u201d. While I write this from a dad\u2019s perspective and experience, this is about an injustice that impacts everyone \u2014 primarily innocent children. But grandparents, wider families and friends suffer terribly too from the injustice of separation from beloved children. My experience is that a mother can decide, for any reason or none, that a marriage is over and the \u201cfamily\u201d is finished; the husband is expected to move out and pay up. If he doesn\u2019t leave his children, a playbook of tactics and allegations is employed to ramp up the pressure. Solicitors are supposed to consider all parties and they are not supposed to do anything that might inflame the situation but this is far from my experience. A more vulnerable person could have been pushed over the edge. \u2018Everyone knows there is one law for fathers and another for mothers\u2019 The State\u2019s sole intervention on behalf of my \u201cfamily\u201d was to advise that counselling and mediation was available. Box ticked, the white-collar mugging proceeded in earnest; the system is a money printing press for the legal fraternity. And the State creams off 23pc Vat on all legal and professional fees \u2014 profiting from misery. While emotionally I was still in turmoil from the shock and loss of it all, I began to look forward \u2014 in my naivety \u2014 to the refuge of the courts and the prospect of getting things settled, getting justice. I paid my legal bills while buying groceries on credit cards and cashing in anything I could to stay afloat financially. But why on earth is it called a divorce \u201ctrial\u201d? And why was my poor, sweet, innocent child\u2019s future being determined by the same court service that deals with drug offences, sexual offences, larceny, robbery and fraud? I was advised not to expect the legals to be over until my child was 18 \u2014 which has proved prescient. I lost count at 50 court dates and the countless number of times I walked out of courtrooms feeling the system was determined to force me out of my child\u2019s life, despite all the evidence that exists as to the powerful affirmative role fathers have. In these courtrooms I was often the only male present \u2014 something that is unacceptable on interview panels or boards. A male always feels one-nil down heading into the Family Court. In practice, everyone knows there is one law for fathers and another for mothers. The most scandalous aspect of all is Section 47 \u2014 the effective \u201coutsourcing\u201d of custody decisions ordered by the court when the parents \u201ccannot\u201d agree. The resulting court orders are effectively cages, dictating children\u2019s movements between parents \u2014 to the minute \u2014 365 days a year. Dictating where parents can live (the locality, not just the county), when they can work, what type of work they can do, where they can go on the weekends and on holidays. In reality it is often one adversarial parent who forces this. Consistent with the \u201cno fault\u201d system, the court takes no view on their refusal to put the children\u2019s interests first, lumbering the children and the other parent with the trauma, time and cost of a Section 47. Parents are generally much better placed to make decisions in their children\u2019s best interests than the courts. But I had no choice. In the information age, the Section 47 process must be one of the last unjustifiably opaque non-security-related top secret classified mechanisms of the State. There is no published list of Section 47 practitioners and no one seems to know any \u2014 there appears to be a tiny cartel. Section 47 reports (paid for by parents) are the property of the court and a copy is not given to the parents. All staff entrusted with caring for our children are highly trained, vetted and regulated, subject to scrutiny and standards. Incredibly, none of this is the case with Section 47 practitioners. No minimum qualifications are required and there are no regulations on who can conduct Section 47 reports. There is no published code of conduct, and no regulatory/statutory body to whom one can report concerns about a Section 47 practitioner. I have experienced malpractice with multiple Section 47 practitioners: incompetence, gender-bias, basic sloppy mistakes, money-grabbing, a lack of compassion and basic bad manners. It is an unregulated, unprofessional Wild West \u2014 an abomination which needs to be exposed and replaced. There is no transparency, no accountability and no oversight. All is shrouded in secrecy behind the \u2018in-camera\u2019 rule. The Department of Justice\u2019s mission is working for a fair and inclusive Ireland \u2014 but my experience of the family law system has been deeply unfair and deeply biased.", "summary": "<p>Anything related to families can be complex and emotive.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/divorce-and-children-its-an-unregulated-wild-west-how-outdated-court-system-is-causing-hurt-and-heartache/a1212324643.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/0DdOtBc75GJRwSE_u_VClHDna7A=/0x0:960x640/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/0153f0ed-21e1-426a-99ed-b61c3cfe9c2e/a93e8999-ee92-4175-a670-07c82ce4e278/0153f0ed-21e1-426a-99ed-b61c3cfe9c2e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:57:39", "author": "Aisling Parkes And Simone Mccaughren", "authors": ["Aisling Parkes And Simone Mccaughren"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.336}

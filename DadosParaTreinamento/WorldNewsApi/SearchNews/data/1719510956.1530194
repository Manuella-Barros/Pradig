{"id": 223722822, "title": "Police called to break up XL Bully fight as two women charged in Dundee", "text": "Two women have been charged under the Dangerous Dogs Act after police were called to break up a fight between two XL Bullies. At around 6.30pm on Saturday, May 25, Police Scotland received a report of two dogs fighting in the Cardross Place area of Dundee. Two women, aged 53 and 36, were charged in connection to the Dangerous Dogs act and the XL Bullies were removed to kennels. Restrictions around XL Bully dogs came into force in Scotland earlier this year. Since February, owners are no longer allowed to breed, sell, exchange, gift, abandon or allow the dogs to stray. It will still be legal for current owners to keep their pets but they must be muzzled and on a lead when in public. Even tougher restrictions will come into force from August 1. From then it will become an offence to own an XL bully without an exemption or having applied for an exemption. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: \u201cWe were called around 6.30pm on Saturday, May 25, to a report of two dogs fighting in the Cardross Place area of Dundee. \u201cOfficers attended and two women, aged 53 and 36, were charged in connection with the Dangerous Dogs Act. A report will be sent to the Procurator Fiscal. \u201cThe dogs were removed to kennels.\u201d", "summary": "Two women, aged 53 and 36, were charged in connection to the Dangerous Dogs Act .", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/north/police-called-to-break-up-xl-bully-fight-as-two-women-charged-in-dundee", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/431049969a33c42d03bc9c3c3abb5319-1704977221.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:57:14", "author": "Caitlyn Dewar", "authors": ["Caitlyn Dewar"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": -0.734}

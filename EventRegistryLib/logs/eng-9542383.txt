Credit - Getty Images/iStock\n\nVideo footage of a student making racist gestures, seemingly imitating a monkey, toward a Black woman who was part of a scheduled pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Mississippi, colloquially known as Ole Miss, went viral last week, and on Sunday a fraternity announced that it had removed one member from its chapter at the school over the incident.\n\nThe Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters said in a statement that it was aware of the widely shared Ole Miss video and that \"the racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter. The responsible individual was removed from membership on Friday, May 3.\"\n\nThe individual was not named, and the school has also announced a student conduct investigation into one unnamed student.\n\nThe university chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) identified the student making the monkey gestures as James \"JP\" Staples from the Phi Delta Theta fraternity in an Instagram post on Saturday that called for the expulsion of Staples as well as two other students -- Connor Moore and Rouse Davis Boyce, both from the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity -- that it said were \"the primary perpetrators of racist remarks and actions that constitute derogatory and offensive behavior.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, pro-Palestinian protests have spread across U.S. campuses, met with arrests and counterprotests. At Ole Miss, about 30 pro-Palestinian protesters took part in what Gov. Tate Reeves described as a \"scheduled\" protest, while hundreds of onlookers and counterprotesters taunted them and sang the Star-Spangled Banner to drown out the protesters' chants.\n\nOne protester, identified by the Mississippi Free Press as graduate student Jaylin Smith, was singled out for abuse by counterprotesters, who mocked her weight and lobbed racial abuse at her.\n\nVideos of the confrontation at Ole Miss drew reactions from lawmakers who have been vocal in their opposition to pro-Palestinian protests breaking out across American campuses. Republican Rep. Mike Collins appeared to praise the counterprotesters in a post on X that described the viral video as \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\" Meanwhile, Reeves, also a Republican, shared a separate video of the protesters and counterprotesters on campus, saying that it \"warms my heart.\"\n\nBut backlash toward the apparent racism on display also followed. The Ole Miss Associated Student Body -- the university's student government -- said in a statement that at the protest, \"unacceptable remarks were made that departed from our cherished values.\"\n\nJacob Batte, the university's director of news and media relations, similarly told ABC News that \"statements were made at the demonstration on our campus Thursday that were offensive and inappropriate,\" though he said that they \"cannot comment specifically about that video.\"\n\nChancellor Glenn Boyce wrote in an email to students and staff on Thursday evening that there were no arrests and no reported injuries from the demonstration, which \"dispersed without incident.\" However, Boyce wrote in a separate email to students on Friday night that \"university leaders are aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones.\"\n\n\"While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation. We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted,\" he said.\n\nPhi Delta Theta and Ole Miss did not respond immediately to TIME's requests for comment.\n\nBoyce referenced Ole Miss' fraught past -- specifically, a history of racism that the school is still grappling with -- in his note to university members, saying that \"it is important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this can set us back.\"\n\n\"It is one reason why we do not take this lightly,\" he said, \"and cannot let the unacceptable behavior of a few speak for our institution or define us.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "koh_ewe@aol.com", "name": "Koh Ewe", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Some of them held American flags or Donald Trump flags, while others can be seen dressed in red, white, and blue.\n\nBut one video in particular shows the moment when the counterprotester amid a group of mostly other young white men can be seen appearing to imitate a monkey as the Black woman records.\n\nVideos showed student making monkey-like gestures at Black woman\n\nThe pro-Palestinian protesters had gathered Thursday at the university's quad, joining demonstrations that have been spreading to college campuses around the nation as the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to rise amid the Israeli-Hamas war that began Oct. 7.\n\nSeveral dozen students were peacefully evacuated from the University of Mississippi campus after more than 200 counter-protestors started to throw objects and shout at the protestors, the Clarion Ledger, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. About 50 to 60 protestors had gathered for a demonstration before the event escalated with counter-protestors outnumbering the pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nAs videos proliferated online, one in particular showing a Black woman confronting a group of white male counterprotesters yelling at each other quickly went viral. In it, a man imitates the sounds and movements of a monkey toward the woman, while others in the crowd can be heard chanting, \"Lock her up!\"\n\nTrump, other right-wing leaders praise counterprotesters\n\nMany Republicans and conservatives took to social media to thank the crowd of counterprotesters for confronting the pro-Palestine protesters.\n\nRep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) shared video of the confrontation last week on social media site X, saying it showed \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump reposted a video of counter-protesters chanting on his official Instagram page along with the caption, \"Thank you Ole Miss -- MAGA.\"\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves initially came out with a statement on X before the protests began stating that peaceful protests are a constitutional right \"no matter how outrageous those protesters views may seem to some of us.\" He later shared a video on his account praising the counterprotesters, saying, \"Warms my heart. I love Mississippi!\"\n\nUniversity opens investigation amid outcry\n\nIn a letter to students and faculty the next day, university Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce said that the university has launched an investigation into one student after it became \"aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable.\"\n\nThe university will determine whether more cases are warranted, Boyce added.\n\n\"Behaviors and comments that demean people because of their race or ethnicity marginalize them and undermine the values that are fundamental to a civil and safe society,\" he added in the letter, provided Monday to USA TODAY. \"People who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus\n\n\"It is one reason why we do not take this lightly and cannot let the unacceptable behavior of a few speak for our institution or define us,\" Boyce concluded. \"We are a community of scholars committed to creating an academic experience that respects the dignity of each individual.\"\n\nStudent in video removed from Phi Delta Theta frat\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the fraternity Phi Delta Theta said it removed a member from its Mississippi Alpha chapter at the school responsible for the \"racist actions in the video,\" which it said are antithetical to its values.\n\nOther student groups at the university also condemned the actions displayed in the viral video, along with the behavior of the counterprotesters as a whole.\n\n\"Yesterday, we observed a demonstration on our campus - a place for the expression of diverse viewpoints, protected by our constitutional First Amendment Rights,\" the Ole Miss Associate Student Body said in a statement on Friday, which provided a list of resources available to students. \"Yet, amidst this expression, unacceptable remarks were made that departed from our cherished values.\"\n\nThe university's Black Student Union also released a statement expressing solidarity with the pro-Palestinian protesters, whom they described as \"nonviolent demonstrators who were advocating for Palestine.\"\n\n\"The students were exercising their right under the First Amendment, while the counter-protesters were present with malicious intent as well as a prominent lack of knowledge on the situation at hand,\" the

The protest is part of a growing number of demonstrations on university campuses around the country.\n\nIn videos of the demonstration, many noted that the pro-Palestinian demonstrators were a multiracial group surrounded by primarily white counterprotesters who were mocking them, NBC Reports.\n\nThe event reportedly turned hostile, and in one confrontation, a Black female graduate student standing on a barricade protested and took video of two young men yelling in her direction as they approached. In one widely shared video, it appears that a man is \"jumping up and down as if he is impersonating a monkey to the woman.\"\n\nOther members of the group yelled \"Lizzo\" and \"Lock her up\" at the woman, who was guided away by police.\n\nAccording to The Daily Mississippian, the university's Black Student Union released a statement in solidarity with the pro-Palestinian group, which it described as \"nonviolent demonstrators who were advocating for Palestine.\"\n\n\"The students were exercising their right under the First Amendment, while the counter-protesters were present with malicious intent as well as a prominent lack of knowledge on the situation at hand,\" the statement posted to Instagram said.\n\nThe student who directed the noises at the Black grad student has reportedly been kicked out of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity following the circulation of the video online.\n\n\"Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,\" the organization wrote in a statement on Sunday. \"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter.\"\n\n\"The responsible individual was removed from membership on Friday, May 3,\" the statement continued.\n\nJaylin Smith, 24, told CNN she was the woman in the video. \"One thing that will never break me is people taunting me or making monkey noises at me,\" Smith, a graduate student at Ole Miss, told CNN.\n\nUniversity chancellor Glenn Boyce wrote to students and staff on Friday, noting, \"While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation,\" adding, \"We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted.\"\n\n\"To be clear, people who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus,\" Boyce

Videos of the encounter showed the counter-protest group growing aggressive, surrounding and yelling at the demonstrators. In a disturbing moment, a white student is seen making monkey noises directed at a Black woman as others taunt and cheer.\n\nVideos of the counter-protesters were shared widely on social media and prompted support and adulation from Republicans.

Mike Collins (R-Ga.) added his own cheers as the Black student was jeered, writing: \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nJaylin Smith, 24, told CNN she was the woman in the video.

Some of them held American flags or Donald Trump flags, while others can be seen dressed in red, white, and blue.\n\nBut one video in particular shows the moment when the counterprotester amid a group of mostly other young white men can be seen appearing to imitate a monkey as the Black woman records.\n\nVideos showed student making monkey-like gestures at Black woman\n\nThe pro-Palestinian protesters had gathered Thursday at the university's quad, joining demonstrations that have been spreading to college campuses around the nation as the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to rise amid the Israeli-Hamas war that began Oct. 7.\n\nSeveral dozen students were peacefully evacuated from the University of Mississippi campus after more than 200 counter-protestors started to throw objects and shout at the protestors, the Clarion Ledger, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. About 50 to 60 protestors had gathered for a demonstration before the event escalated with counter-protestors outnumbering the pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nAs videos proliferated online, one in particular showing a Black woman confronting a group of white male counterprotesters yelling at each other quickly went viral. In it, a man imitates the sounds and movements of a monkey toward the woman, while others in the crowd can be heard chanting, \"Lock her up!\"\n\nTrump, other right-wing leaders praise counterprotesters\n\nMany Republicans and conservatives took to social media to thank the crowd of counterprotesters for confronting the pro-Palestine protesters.\n\nRep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.) shared video of the confrontation last week on social media site X, saying it showed \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump reposted a video of counter-protesters chanting on his official Instagram page along with the caption, \"Thank you Ole Miss -- MAGA.\"\n\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves initially came out with a statement on X before the protests began stating that peaceful protests are a constitutional right \"no matter how outrageous those protesters views may seem to some of us.\" He later shared a video on his account praising the counterprotesters, saying, \"Warms my heart. I love Mississippi!\"\n\nUniversity opens investigation amid outcry\n\nIn a letter to students and faculty the next day, university Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce said that the university has launched an investigation into one student after it became \"aware that some statements made were offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable,\" multiple outlets reported\n\n\"We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted,\" he added in the letter, quoted widely in reports. \"Behaviors and comments that demean people because of their race or ethnicity marginalize them and undermine the values that are fundamental to a civil and safe society.\"\n\n\"It is one reason why we do not take this lightly and cannot let the unacceptable behavior of a few speak for our institution or define us,\" Boyce concluded. \"We are a community of scholars committed to creating an academic experience that respects the dignity of each individual.\"\n\nThe University of Mississippi did not immediately respond Monday to USA TODAY.\n\nStudent in video removed from Phi Delta Theta frat\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, the fraternity Phi Delta Theta said it removed a member from its Mississippi Alpha chapter at the school responsible for the \"racist actions in the video,\" which it said are antithetical to its values.\n\nOther student groups at the university also condemned the actions displayed in the viral video, along with the behavior of the counterprotesters as a whole.\n\n\"Yesterday, we observed a demonstration on our campus - a place for the expression of diverse viewpoints, protected by our constitutional First Amendment Rights,\" the Ole Miss Associate Student Body said in a statement on Friday, which provided a list of resources available to students. \"Yet, amidst this expression, unacceptable remarks were made that departed from our cherished values.\"\n\nThe university's Black Student Union also released a statement expressing solidarity with the pro-Palestinian protesters, whom they described as \"nonviolent demonstrators who were advocating for Palestine.\"\n\n\"The students were exercising their right under the First Amendment, while the counter-protesters were present with malicious intent as well as a prominent lack of knowledge on the situation at hand,\" the statement shared on Instagram said.",

But in a statement Sunday, the fraternity said it pinpointed the man captured in a viral video and disassociated itself from him.\n\n\"Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,\" the statement read. \"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter. The responsible individual was removed from membership on Friday, May 3.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the school said it is launching an investigation into the conduct of at least one student during the counterprotests. Chancellor Glenn F. Boyce sent a letter to students and staff Friday noting that Ole Miss leaders were aware of behaviors that were \"offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones\" at Thursday's protest.\n\n\"While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation,\" he wrote. \"We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted.\"\n\nVideos of the protest posted on social media show the larger crowd, of about 200 seemingly mostly white young people, surrounding and shouting down the multiracial group of about 30 pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nAnother video showed the counterprotesters singing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to drown out the chants from the pro-Palestinian protesters, while yet another video showed a large crowd of men, including two male students who appear to be white, in American flag overalls, yelling in the direction of a Black female graduate student. In the video, the woman appears to be walking toward the crowd while recording them on her phone.\n\nThe woman and the two men, whose identities NBC News has not independently verified, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, another man can be seen jumping up and down and appearing to make a noise to simulate an ape. That person has not been identified.\n\nMembers of the crowd also chanted, \"Lock her up!\" as police guided the woman away from the hecklers, in a video shared on social media by Rep. Mike Collins, R-Georgia.\n\nCollins, who heralded the counter-protest on social media last week, said Monday that while he still stands by the counter-protest, if someone in the video was \"found to have treated another human being improperly because of their race, they should be punished appropriately, and will hopefully seek forgiveness.\"\n\nThe racial elements of the encounter led many observers online to point out Mississippi's long and sordid history of violent racism against Black people. Its senators voted to send all of its Black people back to Africa more than 100 years ago. When the University of Mississippi was ordered by a federal court to admit Black students in 1962, 2,000 white people rioted against the arrival of the new student, James Meredith.\n\nThe initial demonstration in a fenced-off area of the quad took place as colleges across the country have become backdrops for pro-Palestinian protests ranging from small and peaceful to shockingly violent.\n\nIn a statement sent to the news media shortly after the encounter, Ole Miss said it was \"committed to supporting the rights of our students, faculty and employees to express their views in a respectful manner and to assemble peacefully as enshrined in the First Amendment.

Some of them held American flags or Donald Trump flags, while others can be seen dressed in red, white, and blue.\n\nBut one video in particular shows the moment when the counterprotester amid a group of mostly other young white men can be seen appearing to imitate a monkey as the Black woman records.\n\nThe pro-Palestinian protesters had gathered Thursday at the university's quad, joining demonstrations that have been spreading to college campuses around the nation as the civilian death toll in Gaza continues to rise amid the Israeli-Hamas war that began Oct. 7.\n\nSeveral dozen students were peacefully evacuated from the University of Mississippi campus after more than 200 counter-protestors started to throw objects and shout at the protestors, the Clarion Ledger, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. About 50 to 60 protestors had gathered for a demonstration before the event escalated with counter-protestors outnumbering the pro-Palestinian protestors.\n\nAs videos proliferated online, one in particular showing a Black woman confronting a group of white male counterprotesters yelling at each other quickly went viral.

The action in question was offensive, outside the bounds of this discourse, and contradictory to our values.\n\nIn partnership with local alumni, undergraduate leadership, and the university, disciplinary due process was initiated which resulted in the removal of membership. The situation will continue to be monitored in cooperation with any further investigation.\"\n\nThe University of Mississipi - colloquially known as \"Ole Miss\" - has not yet responded to the student's removal from the fraternity or the specific video.\n\n\"It was easily 10-1 counter-protesters to protesters,\" Stacey J Spiehler, who posted the original clip to X, told The Independent. She said the woman, a student, stepped outside the protected barricade and was taking video on her phone.\n\nAs the woman approaches the group of male students, chants of \"lock her up\" can be heard.\n\n\"Counter-protesters were throwing things. I saw half a chicken parm sandwich on the ground, a carrot,\" Ms Spiehler said. \"She was brave, holding her own and had more intelligence and empathy in her little finger than that whole crowd. Whether or not you agree with her, she embodies UM.\"\n\nThe video surfaced as ongoing pro-Palestinian protests at multiple college campus across the nation continue over the Israel-Gaza war.\n\nIn a statement to The Independent on Friday, a spokesperson for Ole Miss wrote: \"Statements were made at the demonstration on our campus Thursday that were offensive and inappropriate.\n\n\"We cannot comment specifically about that video, but the university is looking into reports about specific actions. Any actions that violate university policy will be met with appropriate action.\"\n\nThe video prompted reaction from politicians, though opinion was clearly devided. Republican legislator Rep. Mike Collins from Georgia, reposted the video showing the racist slur and wrote \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nOther politicians later weighed in. \"This is a video showing anti-Blackness,\" Former Ohio State Senator Nina Turner wrote, reposting Collins' post. \"This is a sitting Congressman applauding it.\"\n\nRob Smith, a U.S. veteran of the Iraq War, wrote, \"An elected official in the House of Representatives should absolutely not be tweeting out this video with this caption.

The clash occurred after a diverse group of about 30 students protesting against Israel's war in Gaza were outnumbered by almost entirely white counter-protesters at a ratio of 10 to one, according to the Mississippi Free Press.\n\nRelated: Don't let the sound and fury over Gaza protests drown out what the students are saying | Nesrine Malik\n\nA video that has since gone viral showed one of the white male counter-protesters jumping up and down and making monkey noises in front of a Black woman with the pro-Palestinian protest group. Other white men then echoed the racist noises, and began chanting: \"Lock her up!\"\n\nSome of the protesters were dressed in Stars and Stripes dungarees, others held aloft US and Donald Trump flags. They threw water bottles and cups at the pro-Palestinian protesters and yelled: \"Who's your daddy?\", \"Take a shower\", and \"Shave your legs\", among other offensive chants.\n\nAnnouncing the investigation, Boyce acknowledged the bitter history of racism and segregation at the 25,000-strong university, which only accepted its first Black student under legal duress in 1962. \"It is important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this set us back. It is one reason we do not take this lightly,\" the chancellor said.\n\nThe fraternity Phi Delta Theta has said that it has expelled a member it called \"the responsible individual\" behind \"racist actions\" that it said were \"antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter\". The identity of the individual, as well as that of the person under university investigation, have not been released.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, struck a different response. Invoking an acronym for his \"Make American great again\" slogan, the former president published a video on Instagram showing white counter-protesters waving a Trump flag and wrote: \"Thank you Ole Miss - MAGA!\"\n\nThe overtly racist tone adopted by some of the counter-protesters on such an august campus called to mind some of the most regrettable events of segregation in the deep south of the US. When James Meredith became the first Black student at the university 62 years ago, his arrival was met with rioting by 2,000 white people, culminating with President John F Kennedy sending in the national guard.\n\nIn 1983, Black students had to go into hiding on campus after 1,000 white students descended on their house singing \"Dixie\". A year earlier, the Ku Klux Klan marched brazenly through the university grounds.\n\nToday the university remains disproportionately white.

It did not name the student, nor did it specify whether he was the one who made the monkey noises and gestures.", "source": {"uri": "local3news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local3News.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@local3news.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "emily_wagster_pettus@local3news.com", "name": "Emily Wagster Pettus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Mississippi", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Mississippi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_Delta_Theta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phi Delta Theta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/local3news.com/content/tncms/custom/image/8f26ebb2-3272-11ec-8535-83c9562b8454.png?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542383", "eventUri": "eng-9542383", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

More than 2,200 people have been arrested as demonstrators continue their demands that schools cut financial ties with companies that are contributing to Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nColumbia joined the University of Southern California in canceling its general commencement ceremony following the growing campus protests across the country.\n\nOn Saturday, the University of Michigan's main commencement ceremony was interrupted by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.\n\nEmory University announced on Monday that it would move its May 13 commencement off campus due to safety and security concerns. In a letter, Emory President Gregory Fenves said that he wants to stay \"firm\" in his \"commitment that Emory will celebrate our graduating students at Commencement.\"\n\nOn Thursday, a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators at the University of Mississippi became surrounded by a larger group of counterprotesters. The situation became tense enough that the pro-Palestinian demonstrators had to be escorted into a building by police.\n\nVideos of the confrontation showed the counterprotesters -- mostly young white men -- singing songs like \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" to drown out chants. One video showed a young white man making racist comments and gestures at a Black female pro-Palestinian demonstrator, who was also filming the confrontation on her phone.\n\nOn Friday, University of Mississippi Chancellor Glenn Boyce sent out a statement to students and staff that the school was aware of the \"offensive, hurtful and unacceptable\" behavior displayed in some of the videos.\n\n\"While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation,\" Boyce wrote. \"We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted.\"\n\nThe video garnered support from some Republican legislators, however. Rep. Mike Collins of Georgia and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves both shared the video on X in affirmation of the behavior, writing, \"Ole Miss taking care of business\" and \"Warms my heart,\" respectively.\n\nThe fraternity Phi Delta Theta stated on Sunday that it was aware of the video and that it had removed \"the responsible individual\" from the fraternity, saying, \"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta.\"\n\nDemonstrators at UT Austin have called for the school to divest itself from companies manufacturing weapons for the Israel Defense Forces and demanded university president Jay Hartzell resign. A group of roughly 300 people gathered on campus Sunday for a demonstration, which ended peacefully and with no arrests -- a contrast to the April 29 protest during which police officers pepper-sprayed the crowds.\n\nIn response to the demands, the governor tweeted on Sunday, \"The only thing that will happen is the University and the State will use all law-enforcement tools to quickly terminate illegal protests.\"\n\nRead Yahoo News' coverage of the University of Texas at Austin protests here.\n\nMembers of the student group Princeton Israeli Apartheid Divest launched a hunger strike on Sunday, saying they will not eat or drink -- except for water -- until their demands are met. Demands include the university disclosing all of its investments, divesting from companies that \"profit or engage\" with Israel and committing to a \"full academic and cultural boycott of Israel.\"\n\nThe Daily Princetonian reported that at least 17 undergraduate students are involved in the hunger strike.\n\nMichael Hotchkiss, an assistant vice president for communications at Princeton, told CNN that physicians are watching the group of student protesters who launched the hunger strike.\n\n\"Dr. Melissa Marks, director of medical services at University Health Services, visited the group on Friday and Sunday to offer health information and ongoing medical support.

Praises Ole Miss Counterprotesters, Including White Student M", "body": "NewsOne Featured Video CLOSE\n\nSource: Screenshot\n\nYou know -- sometimes you can tell you're on the right side of history just by looking at who's on the other side. The wave of ongoing pro-Palestine protests at colleges across the country is a shining example of this, because while it's clear that what's being protested is the death toll in Gaza, which overwhelmingly dwarfs the Israeli death toll, much of American media, the U.S. government and white conservatives across the MAGA world have worked overtime to characterize the protests as being in support of the atrocities committed by Hamas (which is why the majority of Americans blindly side with Israel).\n\nSo, the same people who spread propaganda about Black Lives Matter, critical race theory, election results, Black history, \"wokeness,\" migrant crime and DEI are now propagandizing college students as pro-terrorism when they're actually anti-genocide.\n\nMORE: Silence Is Not Consent: Resistance Is Required Today, Tomorrow And Forever\n\nAnd that's why a viral video shows a racist frat bro making monkey noises at a Black woman protester while the rest of the counter-protesters jeer, and a pro-Trump Republican congressman is praising the display of bigotry.\n\nFrom Newsweek:\n\nLast week, pro-Palestinian protests at Ole Miss were met with several counterprotests, who were reportedly fraternity members. The counterprotesters were carrying flags supporting former President Donald Trump and shouted slogans that included \"f*** Joe Biden\" and \"who's your daddy.\"\n\nIn the viral video, the Black female student can be seen walking toward a group of white students as they appear to mock and film her.\n\nWhile the counterprotester who was accused of making racist gestures has not been identified, the student's fraternity confirmed in a statement on Sunday that he was removed from the organization.\n\n\"Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,\" the statement reads. \"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter. The responsible individual was removed from membership on Friday, May 3.\"\n\nSure, it was just one guy, but it's not like we saw anyone on his side of the scrimmage line taking issue with what he was doing. Speaking of people who had no issue with the clear display of racism, Rep. Mike Collins (R-Georgia) is currently getting dragged across social media by posting footage of the counterprotesters under the caption, \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\"\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar with Rep. Collins, he's the same guy who, with zero evidence to substantiate it, linked a train derailment in Ohio last year to DEI initiatives, which has become the go-to for white conservatives who desperately search for new ways to say the N-word without saying it. Earlier this year, he (possibly jokingly, but, honestly, possibly not) suggested murdering migrants by tossing them from helicopters into the sea. He was also accused of antisemitism for promoting a neo-Nazi's post on social media targeting a Jewish Washington Post reporter.\n\nAgain, sometimes you know you're on the right side just by the company you're not keeping. If you find yourself on the same side of an issue with the Mike Collinses or monkey noise-making bigots of the world, it might be time to, at the very least, reevaluate your position.\n\n'Uncle Tom': Video Shows Rep.

Boyce said school officials are working to determine whether further investigations are warranted.\n\n\"As a public institution, we are committed to supporting the rights of our students, faculty, and employees to express their views in a respectful manner and to assemble peacefully as guaranteed by the First Amendment,\" said Boyce in the May 3 email, which school officials shared with ABC News. \"However, some individuals at the demonstration acted in ways that conflict with our university's values. Behaviors and comments that demean people because of their race or ethnicity marginalize them and undermine the values that are fundamental to a civil and safe society.\"\n\nThe dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters had gathered on the campus to call for the university to divest of any investments that might benefit Israeli military operations in Gaza. They are also calling for the university to condemn what they call \"genocide\" against Palestinians amid Israel's war in Gaza, which began on Oct. 7 when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel, and Israel retaliated with its ongoing military operations in Gaza.\n\nSince Oct. 7, Israeli forces have killed at least 34,183 people in Gaza and injured 77,143 others, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. At least 1,700 people have been killed and 8,700 others injured in Israel by Hamas or other Palestinian militants, according to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters at the University of Mississippi said in a statement that they were subject to racism, violent threats, and having food thrown at them by counterprotesters, some of whom allegedly said, \"here's your humanitarian aid.\"\n\nIn one video, a Black protester can be seen recording and speaking to counterprotesters while outside of the protective barricades surrounding the pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nLaw enforcement officers can be seen urging her to walk back inside the barricades as counterprotestors taunt her, including one student apparently impersonating a monkey and others chanting \"lock her up,\" according to student Stacey Spiehler, who took the video.\n\nLaw enforcement also urged the counterprotesters to step back from the barricades.\n\nPhi Delta Theta fraternity general headquarters also released an online statement, saying it is aware of the video and has rescinded the fraternity membership of one individual connected to \"the racist actions in the video.\"\n\nIn a statement following the confrontations, protesters said they were met with \"blind reactionism that had little to do with the genocide we were protesting as well as our demands.\"",

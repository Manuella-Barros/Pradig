{"id": 239742430, "title": "Joe Biden is a one-trick-pony with only one act: Blame Donald Trump", "text": "\u2018Burn our boats,\u201d came the order from 16th-century Spanish conquistador Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. Having landed in the New World, legend has it that he wanted to drive his troops to victory by eliminating their only chance of escape. Joe Biden is nobody\u2019s idea of a swashbuckling adventurer or military leader, but he is adopting a political version of Cort\u00e9s\u2019 gamble. Signs indicate the president is giving up on selling his White House term as a success and betting his re-election campaign on a single message: Donald Trump is bad for America. Make that really, really, really bad. He\u2019ll kill democracy and lock up his opponents. Remember Jan. 6 and, oh, he\u2019s a convicted felon, too. From here to November, that\u2019s the sum and substance of what the president and his surrogates will say. It will be the heart of their advertising and get-out-the-vote campaigns, with virtually every dollar going toward defining Trump as the absolute worst person in the world. Gone from the campaign plan, or so diminished it might as well be gone, are any claims of Biden\u2019s own accomplishments. Remember his brief effort to sell \u201cBidenomics\u201d as a raging success? Shelved as a failure and object of ridicule. How about the claim that Biden tamed inflation, which was 9% when he took office? Debunked as a lie. He inherited 1.4% inflation, which rose to 9% on his watch. Disasters at the border Then there\u2019s the southern border. Upon taking office, Biden rolled back Trump\u2019s successful policies, saying they had \u201can incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity.\u201d But since then, more than 11 million illegal border crossers have entered the United States, an overwhelming influx that has no precedent in American history. So much for law and human dignity. The result is that the incumbent is unable to make the case for his main policies, leaving him little choice except to go all negative, all the time. Thursday\u2019s debate will give voters a clear view of Biden\u2019s decision and offer Trump a chance to showcase his responses. The dynamic will add a new dimension to what is already a crucial moment in the campaign. Biden, of course, faces the greater peril because he is trailing in national polls as well as most battleground states. The president demanded the early debate to try to reverse the trend and give his party a shot of optimism before the August convention. Yet a major element of the plan is getting shredded as fellow Dems warn that the campaign still lacks a winning strategy. An example of the blowback comes in an Atlantic magazine piece, where writer John Hendrickson identifies \u201cThe Biden Campaign\u2019s Losing Battle.\u201d He chronicles aides\u2019 constant squabbling with the media, which he likens to a basketball player reflexively \u2014 and foolishly \u2014 arguing with referees after every whistle. The problem, he writes, is not just the frequency of the criticism, but the content. He believes it\u2019s a dead-end for Biden\u2019s team to demand that the media stop covering Trump as if he\u2019s a normal candidate. Forget the horse race, the polls and even most of the issues, the White House seems to be saying. Trump must be treated as a threat to America and nothing else. Cozy media backfire Although some so-called journalists such as ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos have signed on to the effort to delegitimize Trump, it\u2019s not likely to be a steady diet for many outlets. After all, Trump\u2019s supposed unfitness has been a feature of media coverage for the last eight years. Two results: He\u2019s never been stronger politically, and many leftist outlets are sucking wind. Besides, it\u2019s tough to argue with a straight face that Trump is a unique threat to democracy when Biden\u2019s party is trying to bankrupt him, imprison him and keep him off election ballots. How is any of that protecting democracy? More broadly, Biden\u2019s one-note, negative approach is risky because Americans generally want an optimistic president with a Happy Warrior disposition. Negative campaigning is an important way to draw contrasts, but is rarely offered as the whole meal. All of which underscores Biden\u2019s biggest problem: He doesn\u2019t have significant accomplishments he can run on. Most Americans believe he\u2019s been a terrible president and is too old for a second term. Just 40.5% of voters approve of his performance, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls taken in the last two months. The surveys show an average disapproval of 55.6%, a gap of 15.1 points. And some numbers are still sinking, with a Reuters/Ipsos survey showing him with a rock-bottom approval rating of just 36%. That\u2019s got defeat written all over it. Worse, there\u2019s no popular policy where Biden can plant his flag and say it\u2019s an example of what he will do in a second term. Consider that on questions covering eight major policies, the public gives him lopsided negative ratings on all eight, as tabulated by RealClearPolitics. On the economy, for example, Biden\u2019s average approval is just 40.8%, while his average disapproval is 57.8% \u2014 a negative gap of 17 points. A separate measure of his handling of inflation has him negative 24 points. On immigration, meaning the border, he\u2019s negative 27\u2009points. The closest he comes to a positive measure is Ukraine, where he\u2019s still negative 13 points. On crime, he\u2019s negative 14 points. On the sweeping question of the direction of the country, just 25.5% approve while 64.3% disapprove, a gap of 38 points. Deflect, deflect, deflect Now you know why Biden is going to train all his energy on Trump. He\u2019s reduced to saying to voters, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me, look at him.\u201d Thursday will be the first big test. Whether it works depends on Biden\u2019s energy level and coherence, and how Trump responds. Although the two CNN moderators are certain to help Biden, Trump can\u2019t overreact and get into a tit-for-tat of nasty insults. But even that won\u2019t be sufficient because he also must make a positive case for himself, which would be an effective contrast with Biden. Trump\u2019s ultimate challenge is that he still needs to win over a range of Americans, from urban black voters to suburban white women. Polls say he has made inroads in these and other demographics, but the sale is far from final. The election is still up for grabs. That\u2019s why I believe Trump\u2019s demeanor is almost as important as any zinger or policy comparison. The Dems\u2019 fear-mongering that he is a dictator-in-waiting remains a big obstacle in the minds of many people. He can\u2019t eliminate that fear in one night, but Trump can use the debate to reduce its power. If he does that, he will win a second or even a third look from some voters and further shrink Biden\u2019s chances of victory. In that case, the morning-after sounds you hear will be Dems\u2019 heads exploding.", "summary": "Signs indicate the president is giving up on selling his White House term as a success and betting his re-election campaign on a single message: Donald Trump is bad for America.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/opinion/joe-biden-is-a-one-trick-pony-with-only-one-act-blame-donald-trump/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/JAB1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:58:08", "author": "Michael Goodwin", "authors": ["Michael Goodwin"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.268}

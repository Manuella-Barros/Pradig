{"id": 232035180, "title": "TT 2024: Memorable day for Northern Ireland motorcycling as Michael Dunlop wraps up four-timer and Davey Todd wins Senior finale for TAS Racing", "text": "On a memorable day for Northern Ireland road racing, Englishman Davey Todd won a dramatic Senior TT finale for the Moneymore-based TAS Racing team to give founder Hector Neill the victory he craved more than any other. It was TAS Racing\u2019s first Senior success since Ballymoney\u2019s Adrian Archibald triumphed in 2004 and a remarkable 21st TT victory for the celebrated Ulster outfit around the iconic Mountain Course. Dunlop, who equalled his uncle Joey\u2019s record of 26 wins after winning the opening Monster Energy Supersport race before setting a new benchmark of 27 victories in the Metzeler Supertwin race, was forced out of the blue riband Milwaukee Senior on the first lap. It was a bittersweet end to the TT for the 35-year-old, who also suffered bad luck in the RST Superbike race a week earlier when he lost almost a minute due to a visor issue at the beginning of the fourth lap. Dunlop was leading by 25 seconds on the Hawk Racing Honda with two laps to go when he stopped at the top of Bray Hill to fix the issue. He eventually finished fourth, but the Ballymoney man was hoping for the chance to make amends in the Senior on Sunday after setting a new Superbike TT lap record at almost 136mph. However, he was forced out just after the Bungalow, while more drama followed when race leader Peter Hickman crashed out unhurt at Ginger Hall on the FHO Racing BMW. Nonetheless, Dunlop returns home as the most successful rider in the 117-year history of the TT following a third career quadruple and can bask in the glow of being crowned the new King of the Mountain. The revered Dunlop dynasty now boasts a collective total of 60 TT wins, including five for Michael\u2019s father Robert. \u201cThe week\u2019s been good to us, we\u2019ve been fast and that\u2019s the main thing,\u201d said Dunlop. \u201cTo do all this when I\u2019m still carrying an injury\u2026 I thought it would be hard but I feel mint.\u201d An overjoyed Todd \u2013 now a double TT winner following his maiden triumph in the Superstock race on the Milwaukee BMW \u2013 hailed his Senior achievement as \u2018something special\u2019. \u201cThat\u2019s something special,\u201d said 28-year-old Todd. \u201cI got my first win earlier in the week in the Superstock race but to get the Senior TT is unbelievable. \u201cThe bike has been incredible and has never missed a beat all season. \u201cShe\u2019s been an absolute flying machine, handles like a dream \u2013 I have to give it up to Milwaukee BMW and TAS Racing, what a team.\u201d", "summary": "Michael Dunlop capped a historic week at the Isle of Man TT on Saturday with a double in the Supersport and Supertwin races to secure a fabulous four-timer, extending his record tally to a staggering 29 victories.", "url": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/sport/motorcycling/tt-2024-memorable-day-for-northern-ireland-motorcycling-as-michael-dunlop-wraps-up-four-timer-and-davey-todd-wins-senior-finale-for-tas-racing-4658766", "image": "https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjE3NmQ3Mzg3LWUyNTktNGM2ZC1hNjk5LTlkNWJjNTcxOTA1MjpiYjEwNWZkNy0xMTBkLTRhZWYtODM4Yy0yNGFiNTg4NzMxNTg=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:07:42", "author": "Kyle White", "authors": ["Kyle White"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.228}

Adjusted Gross Margin for our Washington refinery is determined under the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") inventory costing method. Adjusted Gross Margin for our other refineries is determined under the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") inventory costing method.\n\n(2) Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations and severance costs.\n\n(3) We believe the 3-1-2 Singapore Crack Spread (or three barrels of Brent crude oil converted into one barrel of gasoline and two barrels of distillates (diesel and jet fuel)) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Hawaii.\n\n(4) We believe the RVO Adjusted Pacific Northwest 3-1-1-1 (or three barrels of WTI crude oil converted into one barrel of Pacific Northwest gasoline, one barrel of Pacific Northwest ULSD and one barrel of USGC VGO, less 100% of the RVO cost for gasoline and ULSD) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Washington with improved historical correlations to our reported adjusted gross margin compared to prior reported indices.\n\n(5) We believe the RVO Adjusted USGC 3-2-1 (or three barrels of WTI crude oil converted into two barrels of USGC gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD, less 100% of the RVO cost) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Montana and Wyoming with improved historical correlations to our reported adjusted gross margin compared to prior reported indices.\n\nNon-GAAP Performance Measures\n\nManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies since each company may define these terms differently.\n\nWe believe Adjusted Gross Margin (as defined below) provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreements and lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation and amortization. Management uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis, the ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness, and our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA by segment (as defined below) is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate the economic performance of our segments without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported for the second quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude our portion of interest, taxes, and depreciation expense from our refining and logistics investments acquired on June 1, 2023, as part of the Billings Acquisition.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA excludes all hedge losses (gains) associated with our Washington ending inventory and LIFO layer increment impacts associated with our Washington inventory. In addition, we have modified our environmental obligation mark-to-market adjustment to include only the mark-to-market losses (gains) associated with our net RINs liability and net obligation associated with the Washington Climate Commitment Act (\"Washington CCA\") and Clean Fuel Standard. This modification was made as part of our change in how we estimate our environmental obligation liabilities.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Net Income (loss) excludes unrealized interest rate derivative losses (gains) and all Laramie Energy related impacts with the exception of cash distributions. We have recast Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported in the first quarter of 2024, Adjusted Net Income (loss) also excludes other non-operating income and expenses. This modification improves comparability between periods by excluding income and expenses resulting from non-operating activities.\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as operating income (loss) excluding:\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n____________________________________________________________________________\n\n(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no impairment expense and LIFO liquidation adjustment recorded in Operating income (loss).

This tax benefit is included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we did not have any adjustments to our valuation allowance and other deferred tax items.\n\n(2) For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred $13.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses associated with accelerated vesting of equity awards and modification of vested equity awards related to our CEO transition and $2.3 million for an estimated legal settlement unrelated to current operating activities.\n\n(3) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no change in value of contingent consideration, change in value of common stock warrants, impairment expense, impairments associated with our investment in Laramie Energy, or our share of Laramie Energy's asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference. Please read the Non-GAAP Performance Measures discussion above for information regarding changes to the components of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA made during the reporting periods.\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by Segment\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by segment is defined as Operating income (loss) excluding:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by segment also includes Gain on curtailment of pension obligation and Other income (loss), net, which are presented below operating income (loss) on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by segment to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss) by segment, on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n________________________________________\n\n(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no change in value of contingent consideration, change in value of common stock warrants, impairment expense, impairments associated with our investment in Laramie Energy, or our share of Laramie Energy's asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, there was no loss (gain) on sale of assets, severance costs and other non-operating expense, or Par's portion of interest, taxes, and depreciation expense from refining and logistics investments.\n\nLaramie Energy Adjusted EBITDAX\n\nAdjusted EBITDAX is defined as net income (loss) excluding commodity derivative loss (gain), loss (gain) on settled derivative instruments, interest expense, gain on extinguishment of debt, non-cash preferred dividend, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion, exploration and geological and geographical expense, bonus accrual, equity-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, phantom units, and expired acreage (non-cash). We believe Adjusted EBITDAX is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate the economic and operational performance of exploration and production companies such as Laramie Energy.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Laramie Energy's Adjusted EBITDAX to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n________________________________________\n\n(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no exploration and geological and geographical expense, bonus accrual, or equity-based compensation expense.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz",

Adjusted Gross Margin for our Washington refinery is determined under the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") inventory costing method. Adjusted Gross Margin for our other refineries is determined under the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") inventory costing method.(2) Management uses production costs per barrel to evaluate performance and compare efficiency to other companies in the industry. There are a variety of ways to calculate production costs per barrel; different companies within the industry calculate it in different ways. We calculate production costs per barrel by dividing all direct production costs, which include the costs to run the refineries including personnel costs, repair and maintenance costs, insurance, utilities, and other miscellaneous costs, by total refining throughput. Our production costs are included in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) on our consolidated statement of operations, which also includes costs related to our bulk marketing operations and severance costs.(3) We believe the 3-1-2 Singapore Crack Spread (or three barrels of Brent crude oil converted into one barrel of gasoline and two barrels of distillates (diesel and jet fuel)) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Hawaii.(4) We believe the RVO Adjusted Pacific Northwest 3-1-1-1 (or three barrels of WTI crude oil converted into one barrel of Pacific Northwest gasoline, one barrel of Pacific Northwest ULSD and one barrel of USGC VGO, less 100% of the RVO cost for gasoline and ULSD) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Washington with improved historical correlations to our reported adjusted gross margin compared to prior reported indices.(5) We believe the RVO Adjusted USGC 3-2-1 (or three barrels of WTI crude oil converted into two barrels of USGC gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD, less 100% of the RVO cost) is the most representative market indicator for our operations in Montana and Wyoming with improved historical correlations to our reported adjusted gross margin compared to prior reported indices.\n\nNon-GAAP Performance MeasuresManagement uses certain financial measures to evaluate our operating performance that are considered non-GAAP financial measures. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes or alternatives to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies since each company may define these terms differently.\n\nWe believe Adjusted Gross Margin (as defined below) provides useful information to investors because it eliminates the gross impact of volatile commodity prices and adjusts for certain non-cash items and timing differences created by our inventory financing agreements and lower of cost and net realizable value adjustments to demonstrate the earnings potential of the business before other fixed and variable costs, which are reported separately in Operating expense (excluding depreciation) and Depreciation and amortization. Management uses Adjusted Gross Margin per barrel to evaluate operating performance and compare profitability to other companies in the industry and to industry benchmarks. We believe Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) are useful supplemental financial measures that allow investors to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis, the ability of our assets to generate cash to pay interest on our indebtedness, and our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to other companies without regard to financing methods and capital structure. We believe Adjusted EBITDA by segment (as defined below) is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate the economic performance of our segments without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported for the second quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA also exclude our portion of interest, taxes, and depreciation expense from our refining and logistics investments acquired on June 1, 2023, as part of the Billings Acquisition.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), and Adjusted EBITDA excludes all hedge losses (gains) associated with our Washington ending inventory and LIFO layer increment impacts associated with our Washington inventory. In addition, we have modified our environmental obligation mark-to-market adjustment to include only the mark-to-market losses (gains) associated with our net RINs liability and net obligation associated with the Washington Climate Commitment Act (\"Washington CCA\") and Clean Fuel Standard. This modification was made as part of our change in how we estimate our environmental obligation liabilities.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported for the fourth quarter of 2023, Adjusted Net Income (loss) excludes unrealized interest rate derivative losses (gains) and all Laramie Energy related impacts with the exception of cash distributions. We have recast Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for prior periods when reported to conform to the modified presentation.\n\nBeginning with financial results reported in the first quarter of 2024, Adjusted Net Income (loss) also excludes other non-operating income and expenses. This modification improves comparability between periods by excluding income and expenses resulting from non-operating activities.\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin\n\nAdjusted Gross Margin is defined as operating income (loss) excluding:\n\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margin to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss), on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n____________________________________________________________________________(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no impairment expense and LIFO liquidation adjustment recorded in Operating income (loss).

This tax benefit is included in Income tax expense (benefit) on our consolidated statements of operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, we did not have any adjustments to our valuation allowance and other deferred tax items.(2) For the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred $13.1 million of stock-based compensation expenses associated with accelerated vesting of equity awards and modification of vested equity awards related to our CEO transition and $2.3 million for an estimated legal settlement unrelated to current operating activities.(3) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no change in value of contingent consideration, change in value of common stock warrants, impairment expense, impairments associated with our investment in Laramie Energy, or our share of Laramie Energy's asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference. Please read the Non-GAAP Performance Measures discussion above for information regarding changes to the components of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA made during the reporting periods.\n\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per share (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by Segment\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by segment is defined as Operating income (loss) excluding:\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by segment also includes Gain on curtailment of pension obligation and Other income (loss), net, which are presented below operating income (loss) on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by segment to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, operating income (loss) by segment, on a historical basis, for selected segments, for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n________________________________________(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no change in value of contingent consideration, change in value of common stock warrants, impairment expense, impairments associated with our investment in Laramie Energy, or our share of Laramie Energy's asset impairment losses in excess of our basis difference. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, there was no loss (gain) on sale of assets, severance costs and other non-operating expense, or Par's portion of interest, taxes, and depreciation expense from refining and logistics investments.\n\nAdjusted EBITDAX is defined as net income (loss) excluding commodity derivative loss (gain), loss (gain) on settled derivative instruments, interest expense, gain on extinguishment of debt, non-cash preferred dividend, depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion, exploration and geological and geographical expense, bonus accrual, equity-based compensation expense, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, phantom units, and expired acreage (non-cash). We believe Adjusted EBITDAX is a useful supplemental financial measure to evaluate the economic and operational performance of exploration and production companies such as Laramie Energy.\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Laramie Energy's Adjusted EBITDAX to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss) for the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\n________________________________________(1) For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no exploration and geological and geographical expense, bonus accrual, or

We have multiple levers, including continued legacy product growth, new product launches, and a rapidly expanding specialty bracing business that are working together to drive continued growth and profitability. We will continue to advance our strategic initiatives and feel we are positioned well to capitalize on our opportunities for the remainder of 2024 and beyond.\"\n\nFirst Quarter 2024 Financial Results\n\nTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $44.7 million, a 41% increase compared to $31.6 million for the same period last year. U.S. revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $34.3 million, a 44% increase compared to $23.8 million for the same period last year, representing 77% of total revenue. The increase in revenue in the first quarter of 2024 was driven primarily by organic growth in Trauma and Deformity and Scoliosis products as well as the addition of Boston O&P. International revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $10.4 million, a 33% increase compared to $7.8 million for the same period last year, representing 23% of total revenue. Growth in the quarter was primarily driven by increased procedure volumes and additional set sales.\n\nTrauma and Deformity revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $33.3 million, a 42% increase compared to $23.4 million for the same period last year. This growth was driven primarily by growth across numerous product lines, specifically Cannulated Screws, PNP Femur, PediPlate, external fixation and Pega systems, coupled with the addition of Boston O&P. Scoliosis revenue was $10.2 million, a 44% increase compared to $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2023. The growth was driven by increased sales of RESPONSE and ApiFix systems and revenue generated from 7D technology, coupled with the addition of Boston O&P. Sports Medicine/Other revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.2 million, a 5% increase compared to $1.1 million for the same period last year.\n\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2024 was $32.2 million, a 37% increase compared to $23.6 million for the same period last year. Gross profit margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 72%, compared to 75% for the same period last year. The change in gross margin was primarily driven by increased set sales to our international stocking partners as well as lower purchase price adjustments.\n\nTotal operating expenses for the first quarter of 2024 were $41.9 million, a 30% increase compared to $32.2 million for the same period last year. The increase was mainly driven by the addition of Boston O&P as well as incremental personnel required to support the ongoing growth of the Company.\n\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million, or 13%, to $14.2 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by increased sales commission expenses coupled with additional employees to support the OPSB business lines.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.6 million, or 23%, to $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increase was driven by the addition of Boston O&P as well as increased development activities.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $7.6 million, or 44%, to $24.7 million in the first quarter of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by the addition of Boston O&P as well as personnel and resources to support the continued expansion of the business.\n\nTotal other expense was $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $1.2 million of other income for the same period last year. The change was due primarily to the favorable fair value adjustment of contingent consideration in the first quarter of 2023, which did not repeat in 2024 as well as additional interest expense related to the new term loan with MidCap.\n\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2024 was $7.8 million, compared to $6.8 million for the same period last year. Net loss per share for the period was $0.34 per basic and diluted share, compared to $0.30 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024 was a loss of $1.1 million as compared to a loss of $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nWeighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2024, was 22,820,779 shares.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash were $49.7 million compared to $82.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash usage in the first quarter 2024 includes $22.0 million paid for Boston O&P. Additionally, the Company had $10.0 million outstanding under the $80.0 million Credit Agreement.\n\nFull Year 2024 Financial Guidance\n\nFor the full year of 2024, the Company increased its revenue guidance from $197.0 million to $200.0 million up to $200.0 million to $203.0 million, representing growth of 34% to 36% over 2023 revenue. The Company reiterated annual set deployment to be less than $20.0 million and reiterated $8.0 million to $9.0 million of adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2024.\n\nConference Call\n\nOrthoPediatrics will host a conference call on Tuesday, May 7, 2024, at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss the results. Investors interested in listening to the conference call may do so by accessing a live and archived webcast of the event at www.orthopediatrics.com, on the Investors page in the Events & Presentations section. The webcast will be available for replay for at least 90 days after the event.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws. You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"plan,\" \"anticipate,\" \"could,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"target,\" \"predict,\" \"intend,\" \"future,\" \"goals,\" \"potential,\" \"objective,\" \"would\" and other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond OrthoPediatrics' control. Important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including, among others: the risks related to COVID-19, the impact such pandemic may have on the demand for our products, and our ability to respond to the related challenges; and the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth under \"Risk Factors\" in OrthoPediatrics' Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 8, 2024, as updated and supplemented by our other SEC reports filed from time to time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. OrthoPediatrics assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, subsequent events, or circumstances or other changes affecting such statements except to the extent required by applicable securities laws.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue, adjusted loss per share and Adjusted EBITDA, which differ from financial measures calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Sales on an organic basis excludes from our reported net revenue growth the impacts of revenue from any acquired business that have been owned for less than one year. We believe that providing the non-GAAP organic revenue is useful as a way to measure and evaluate our underlying performance consistently across the periods presented. Adjusted loss per share in this press release represents diluted loss per share on a GAAP basis, plus the accreted interest attributable to acquisition installment payables, the fair value adjustment of contingent consideration, acquisition related costs, and minimum purchase commitment costs. The fair value adjustment of contingent consideration is associated with our estimates of the value of earn-outs in connection with certain acquisitions and the non-recurring professional fees are related to our response to a previously disclosed SEC review. We believe that providing the non-GAAP diluted loss per share excluding these expenses, as well as the GAAP measures, assists our investors because such expenses are not reflective of our ongoing operating results. Adjusted EBITDA in this release represents net loss, plus interest expense, net plus other expense, provision for income taxes (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, fair value adjustment of contingent consideration, acquisition related costs, nonrecurring professional fees, and the cost of minimum purchase commitments. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures provided in this earnings release enable it to further and more consistently analyze the period-to-period financial performance of its core business operating performance. Management uses these metrics as a measure of the Company's operating performance and for planning purposes, including financial projections. The Company believes these measures are useful to investors as supplemental information because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in its industry. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to, or superior to, net income or loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed to imply that the Company's future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, the measure is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management's discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as debt service requirements, capital expenditures and other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and other potential cash requirements. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company's presentation of non-GAAP diluted loss per share or Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on the Company's GAAP results in addition to using these adjusted measures on a supplemental basis. The Company's definition of these measures is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. The schedules below contain reconciliations of reported GAAP net revenue to non-GAAP organic revenue, GAAP diluted loss per share to non-GAAP diluted loss and net loss to non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA.\n\nAbout OrthoPediatrics Corp.\n\nFounded in 2006, OrthoPediatrics is an orthopedic company focused exclusively on advancing the field of pediatric orthopedics.

McKinney, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our first quarter 2024 operational and financial results exceeded our expectations on many fronts, helped position the Company to take advantage of the opportunities we believe 2024 may present, and further underscore the benefits of our strategy to maximize cash flow generation. Our Adjusted Free Cash Flow this quarter is up over 48 percent over the same period last year. The robust results of our capital spending program together with our continuing focus on reducing overall costs and downtime led to higher sales volumes than expected despite the impact of an early winter storm, lower capital costs associated with our drilling and completion program, and lower per-Boe lifting costs in many of our field operating areas. These efficiencies and cost savings associated with our first quarter activities have positioned the Company well for the rest of the year and on behalf of our Board of Directors and management team, we thank our office and field employees for the outstanding execution that lead to these results.\"\n\nMr. McKinney concluded, \"As we look to the remainder of 2024, our focus remains unchanged on further improving our balance sheet. We will continue our disciplined capital spending program designed to organically maintain or slightly grow our oil production and we will seek further opportunities to reduce costs. Finally, we will continue to look for opportunities to grow through the pursuit of strategic, accretive and balance sheet enhancing acquisitions.\"\n\nSummary Results\n\nFinancial Overview: For the first quarter of 2024, the Company reported net income of $5.5 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, which included a $17.6 million before-tax non-cash unrealized commodity derivative loss and $1.7 million in before-tax share-based compensation. The Company's Adjusted Net Income was $20.3 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported net income of $50.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, which included a $32.5 million before-tax non-cash unrealized commodity derivative gain, $2.5 million for before-tax share-based compensation, and $0.4 million in before-tax transaction related costs. The Company's Adjusted Net Income for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $21.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share. For the first quarter of 2023, Ring reported net income of $32.7 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, which included a $10.1 million before-tax non-cash unrealized commodity derivative gain and $1.9 million in before-tax share-based compensation. Adjusted Net Income in the first quarter of 2023 was $25.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA was $62.0 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $65.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $58.6 million for the first quarter of 2023 -- a 6% year-over-year increase.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow for the first quarter of 2024 was $15.6 million versus $16.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $10.5 million for the first quarter of 2023. Included was capital spending of $36.3 million in the first quarter of 2024 versus $38.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $38.9 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted Cash Flow from Operations was $51.9 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $55.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023, and $49.4 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations are non-GAAP financial measures, which are described in more detail and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures, in the tables shown later in this release under \"Non-GAAP Financial Information.\"\n\nSales Volumes, Prices and Revenues: Sales volumes for the first quarter of 2024 were 19,034 Boe/d (70% oil, 15% natural gas and 15% NGLs), or 1,732,057 Boe. The Company's guidance for first quarter 2024 was 18,000 to 18,500 Boe/d, including 12,420 to 12,765 Bo/d, with actual results 3% and 5% above the top end of guidance, respectively. Positively impacting first quarter 2024 sales volumes was the Founders Acquisition that closed in August 2023, incremental production brought online during the period associated with the Company's ongoing development program, and less than expected downtime during the months of February and March. Fourth quarter 2023 sales volumes were 19,397 Boe/d (70% oil, 15% natural gas and 15% NGLs), or 1,784,490 Boe, and first quarter of 2023 sales volumes were 18,292 Boe/d (69% oil, 16% natural gas and 15% NGLs), or 1,646,306 Boe. First quarter 2024 sales volumes were comprised of 1,218,837 barrels (\"Bbls\") of oil, 1,496,507 thousand cubic feet (\"Mcf\") of natural gas and 263,802 Bbls of NGLs.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, the Company realized an average sales price of $75.72 per barrel of crude oil, $(0.55) per Mcf of natural gas and $11.47 per barrel of NGLs. The realized natural gas and NGL prices were impacted by a fee reduction to the value received. For the first quarter of 2024, the weighted average natural gas price per Mcf was $1.19 offset by a weighted average fee value per Mcf of ($1.74), and the weighted average NGL price per barrel was $21.40 offset by a weighted average fee per barrel of ($9.93). The combined average realized sales price for the period was $54.56 per Boe, down 3% versus $56.01 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2023, and up 2% from $53.50 per Boe in the first quarter of 2023. The average oil price differential the Company experienced from NYMEX WTI futures pricing in the first quarter of 2024 was a negative $1.34 per barrel of crude oil, while the average natural gas price differential from NYMEX futures pricing was a negative $2.57 per Mcf.\n\nRevenues were $94.5 million for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $99.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $88.1 million for the first quarter of 2023. The 5% decrease in first quarter 2024 revenues from the fourth quarter of 2023 was driven by lower realized pricing and slightly lower overall sales volumes.\n\nLease Operating Expense (\"LOE\"): LOE, which includes expensed workovers and facilities maintenance, was $18.4 million, or $10.60 per Boe, in the first quarter of 2024, which was below the low end of the Company's guidance of $10.75 to $11.25 per Boe. LOE per Boe was below expectations due to lower expense workover costs and higher production. LOE was $18.7 million, or $10.50 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $17.5 million, or $10.61 per Boe, for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGathering, Transportation and Processing (\"GTP\") Costs: As previously disclosed, due to a contractual change effective May 1, 2022, the Company no longer maintains ownership and control of natural gas through processing. As a result, GTP costs are now reflected as a reduction to the natural gas sales price and not as an expense item. There remains only one contract in place with a natural gas processing entity where the point of control of gas dictates requiring the fees to be recorded as an expense.\n\nAd Valorem Taxes: Ad valorem taxes were $1.24 per Boe for the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.92 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $1.01 per Boe for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nProduction Taxes: Production taxes were $2.56 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $2.78 per Boe in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.68 per Boe in first quarter of 2023. Production taxes ranged between 4.7% to 5.0% of revenue for all three periods.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization (\"DD&A\") and Asset Retirement Obligation Accretion: DD&A was $13.74 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 versus $13.76 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $12.92 per Boe in the first quarter of 2023. Asset retirement obligation accretion was $0.20 per Boe in the first quarter of 2024 compared to $0.20 per Boe for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $0.22 per Boe in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses (\"G&A\"): G&A was $7.5 million ($4.31 per Boe) for the first quarter of 2024 versus $8.2 million ($4.58 per Boe) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $7.1 million ($4.33 per Boe) for the first quarter of 2023. G&A, excluding non-cash share-based compensation, was $5.7 million ($3.32 per Boe) for the first quarter of 2024 versus $5.7 million ($3.20 per Boe) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $5.2 million ($3.15 per Boe) for the first quarter of 2023. G&A, excluding non-cash share-based compensation and transaction costs, was $5.7 million ($3.32 per Boe) for the first quarter versus $5.4 million ($3.00 per Boe) for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $5.2 million ($3.15 per Boe) for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nInterest Expense: Interest expense was $11.5 million in the first quarter of 2024 versus $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 and $10.4 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nDerivative (Loss) Gain: In the first quarter of 2024, Ring recorded a net loss of $19.0 million on its commodity derivative contracts, including a realized $1.5 million cash commodity derivative loss and an unrealized $17.6 million non-cash commodity derivative loss. This compares to a net gain of $29.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, including a realized $3.3 million cash commodity derivative loss and an unrealized $32.5 million non-cash commodity derivative gain. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a net gain on commodity derivative contracts of $9.5 million, including a realized $0.6 million cash commodity derivative loss and an unrealized $10.1 million non-cash commodity derivative gain.\n\nA summary listing of the Company's outstanding derivative positions at March 31, 2024 is included in the tables shown later in this release.\n\nFor the remainder (April through December) of 2024, the Company has approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil (approximately 43% of oil sales guidance midpoint) hedged and approximately 1.9 billion cubic feet of natural gas (approximately 41% of natural gas sales guidance midpoint) hedged.\n\nIncome Tax: The Company recorded a non-cash income tax provision of $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2024 versus $7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023 and $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity: Total liquidity (defined as cash and cash equivalents plus borrowing base availability under the Company's credit facility) at March 31, 2024 was $179.3 million, a 3% increase from December 31, 2023. Liquidity at March 31, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1.4 million and $178.0 million of availability under Ring's revolving credit facility, which included a reduction of $35.0 thousand for letters of credit. On March 31, 2024, the Company had $422.0 million in borrowings outstanding on its credit facility that has a current borrowing base of $600.0 million. Consistent with the past, the Company is targeting further future debt reduction dependent on market conditions, the timing and level of capital spending, and other considerations.\n\nCapital Expenditures: During the first quarter of 2024, capital expenditures were $36.3 million, which was below the Company's guidance of $37 million to $42 million, while the number of producing wells drilled and completed -- 11 in total -- was at the high end of the Ring's guidance. In the first quarter of 2024, in the Northwest Shelf, the Company drilled and completed two 1-mile horizontal wells (one with a working interest of 99.5% and the other with a working interest of 100%). In the Central Basin Platform, Ring drilled and completed nine wells, all with a working interest of 100%. Specifically, in its Andrews County acreage the Company drilled and completed three 1-mile horizontal wells, in its Ector County acreage Ring drilled three vertical wells, and in its Crane County acreage the Company drilled and completed three vertical wells. Additionally, within the Central Basin Platform, Ring drilled and completed one salt water disposal (\"SWD\") well in Ector County which was originally planned for the second quarter.\n\nFirst quarter total does not include the SWD well drilled and completed in the Central Basin Platform.\n\nFull Year and Second Quarter 2024 Sales Volumes, Capital Investment and Operating Expense Guidance\n\nIn January, the Company commenced its 2024 development program that includes two rigs (one horizontal and one vertical) and is focused on slightly growing oil volumes while maintaining year-over-year overall production levels. The Company is utilizing a phased (versus continuous) capital drilling program seeking to maximize free cash flow on a quarterly basis.\n\nFor full year 2024, Ring continues to expect total capital spending of $135 million to $175 million that includes a balanced and capital efficient combination of drilling, completing and placing on production 18 to 24 Hz and 20 to 30 vertical wells across the Company's asset portfolio. Additionally, the full year capital spending program includes funds for targeted well recompletions, capital workovers, infrastructure upgrades, reactivations, and leasing costs, as well as non-operated drilling, completion, and capital workovers.\n\nAll projects and estimates are based on assumed WTI oil prices of $70 to $90 per barrel and Henry Hub prices of $2.00 to $3.00 per Mcf. As in the past, Ring has designed its spending program with flexibility to respond to changes in commodity prices and other market conditions as appropriate.\n\nBased on the $155 million mid-point of spending guidance, the Company continues to expect the following estimated allocation of capital investment, including:\n\nThe Company forecasts full year 2024 oil sales volumes of 12,600 to 13,300 Bo/d compared with full year 2023 oil sales volumes of 12,548 Bo/d, with the mid-point of guidance reflecting a 3% increase.\n\nThe Company remains focused on continuing to generate Adjusted Free Cash Flow. All 2024 planned capital expenditures will be fully funded by cash on hand and cash from operations, and excess Adjusted Free Cash Flow is currently targeted for further debt reduction.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Ring is providing guidance for sales volumes, capital spending and operating expense. Benefiting the second quarter is the expectation of a continued positive pricing environment, the success of the first quarter capital spending program that included five wells coming on late in the first quarter, and further development of the Company's high rate-of-return inventory. Ring expects second quarter 2024 sales volumes of 13,000 to 13,400 Bo/d and 18,500 to 19,100 Boe/d (70% oil, 15% natural gas, and 15% NGLs).\n\nThe Company is targeting total capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 of $37 million to $42 million, primarily for drilling and completion activity. Additionally, the capital spending program includes funds for targeted capital workovers, infrastructure upgrades, leasing costs; and non-operated drilling, completion, and capital workovers.\n\nThe guidance in the table below represents the Company's current good faith estimate of the range of likely future results. Guidance could be affected by the factors discussed below in the \"Safe Harbor Statement\" section.\n\nIn addition to Company-directed drilling and completion activities, the capital spending outlook includes funds for targeted well recompletions, capital workovers, infrastructure upgrades, and well reactivations. Also included is anticipated spending for leasing costs; and non-operated drilling, completion, and capital workovers.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nRing will hold a conference call on Tuesday, May 7, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. ET to discuss its first quarter 2024 operational and financial results.

Forward-looking statements involve a wide variety of risks and uncertainties, and include, without limitation, statements with respect to the Company's strategy and prospects. The forward-looking statements include statements about the expected future reserves, production, financial position, business strategy, revenues, earnings, costs, capital expenditures and debt levels of the Company, and plans and objectives of management for future operations. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and analyses made by Ring and its management in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform to expectations is subject to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: declines in oil, natural gas liquids or natural gas prices; the level of success in exploration, development and production activities; adverse weather conditions that may negatively impact development or production activities particularly in the winter; the timing of exploration and development expenditures; inaccuracies of reserve estimates or assumptions underlying them; revisions to reserve estimates as a result of changes in commodity prices; impacts to financial statements as a result of impairment write-downs; risks related to level of indebtedness and periodic redeterminations of the borrowing base and interest rates under the Company's credit facility; Ring's ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet the internally funded portion of its capital expenditures budget; the impacts of hedging on results of operations; and Ring's ability to replace oil and natural gas reserves. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are disclosed in the Company's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, and its other filings. Ring undertakes no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\n\n(1) Boe is determined using the ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of oil (totals may not compute due to rounding.) The conversion ratio does not assume price equivalency and the price on an equivalent basis for oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids may differ significantly.\n\nThe following tables reflect the details of current derivative contracts as of March 31, 2024 (quantities are in barrels (Bbl) for the oil derivative contracts and in million British thermal units (MMBtu) for the natural gas derivative contracts):\n\n(1) The oil basis swap hedges are calculated as the fixed price (weighted average spread price above) less the difference between WTI Midland and WTI Cushing, in the issue of Argus Americas Crude.\n\nRING ENERGY, INC.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nCertain financial information included in this release are not measures of financial performance recognized by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). These non-GAAP financial measures are \"Adjusted Net Income\", \"Adjusted EBITDA\", \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" or \"AFCF,\" \"Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations\" or \"ACFFO,\" \"G&A Excluding Share-Based Compensation,\" \"G&A Excluding Share-Based Compensation and Transaction Costs,\" \"Leverage Ratio,\" and \"All-In Cash Operating Costs.\" Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of performance. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is a key metric used to determine certain of the Company's incentive compensation awards. These disclosures may not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be reported by other companies.\n\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income\n\n\"Adjusted Net Income\" is calculated as net income (loss) minus the estimated after-tax impact of share-based compensation, ceiling test impairment, unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair value of derivatives, and transaction costs for executed acquisitions and divestitures (A&D). Adjusted Net Income is presented because the timing and amount of these items cannot be reasonably estimated and affect the comparability of operating results from period to period, and current period to prior periods. The Company believes that the presentation of Adjusted Net Income provides useful information to investors as it is one of the metrics management uses to assess the Company's ongoing operating and financial performance, and also is a useful metric for investors to compare our results with our peers.\n\nReconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA\n\nThe Company defines \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, unrealized loss (gain) on change in fair value of derivatives, ceiling test impairment, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, asset retirement obligation accretion, transaction costs for executed acquisitions and divestitures (A&D), share-based compensation, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, and backing out the effect of other income. Company management believes Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand Ring's operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for net income, as an indication of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities or as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA, as Ring calculates it, may not be comparable to Adjusted EBITDA measures reported by other companies. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not represent funds available for discretionary use.\n\nReconciliations of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA to Adjusted Free Cash Flow\n\nThe Company defines \"Adjusted Free Cash Flow\" or \"AFCF\" as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities less changes in operating assets and liabilities (as reflected on our Condensed Statements of Cash Flows), plus transaction costs for executed acquisitions and divestitures (A&D), current income tax expense (benefit), proceeds from divestitures of equipment for oil and natural gas properties, loss (gain) on disposal of assets, and less capital expenditures, bad debt expense, and other income. For this purpose, our definition of capital expenditures includes costs incurred related to oil and natural gas properties (such as drilling and infrastructure costs and the lease maintenance costs) but excludes acquisition costs of oil and gas properties from third parties that are not included in our capital expenditures guidance provided to investors. Our management believes that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is an important financial performance measure for use in evaluating the performance and efficiency of our current operating activities after the impact of capital expenditures and net interest expense and without being impacted by items such as changes associated with working capital, which can vary substantially from one period to another. Other companies may use different definitions of Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\n\nReconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations\n\nThe Company defines \"Adjusted Cash Flow from Operations\" or \"ACFFO\" as Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, as reflected in our Condensed Statements of Cash Flows, less the changes in operating assets and liabilities, which includes accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, and settlement of asset retirement obligation, which are subject to variation due to the nature of the Company's operations. Accordingly, the Company believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it is used often in its industry and allows investors to compare this metric to other companies in its peer group as well as the E&P sector.\n\nReconciliation of General and Administrative Expense (G&A) to G&A Excluding Share-Based Compensation and Transaction Costs\n\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of General and Administrative Expense (G&A), a GAAP measure, to G&A excluding share-based compensation, and G&A excluding share-based compensation and transaction costs for executed acquisitions and divestitures (A&D).\n\nCalculation of Leverage Ratio\n\n\"Leverage\" or the \"Leverage Ratio\" is calculated under our existing senior revolving credit facility and means as of any date, the ratio of (i) our consolidated total debt as of such date to (ii) our Consolidated EBITDAX for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date for which financial statements are required to have been delivered under our existing senior revolving credit facility; provided that for the purposes of the definition of 'Leverage Ratio': (a) for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023, Consolidated EBITDAX is calculated by multiplying Consolidated EBITDAX for the three fiscal quarter periods ended on March 31, 2023 by four-thirds, and (b) for each fiscal quarter thereafter, Consolidated EBITDAX will be calculated by adding Consolidated EBITDAX for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on such date.\n\nThe Company defines \"Consolidated EBITDAX\" in accordance with our existing senior revolving credit facility that means for any period an amount equal to the sum of (i) consolidated net income (loss) for such period plus (ii) to the extent deducted in determining consolidated net income for such period, and without duplication, (A) consolidated interest expense, (B) income tax expense determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, (C) depreciation, depletion and amortization determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, (D) exploration expenses determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, and (E) all other non-cash charges acceptable to our senior revolving credit facility administrative agent determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, in each case for such period minus (iii) all noncash income added to consolidated net income (loss) for such period; provided that, for purposes of calculating compliance with the financial covenants, to the extent that during such period we shall have consummated an acquisition permitted by the credit facility or any sale, transfer or other disposition of any property or assets permitted by the senior revolving credit facility, Consolidated EBITDAX will be calculated on a pro forma basis with respect to the property or assets so acquired or disposed of.\n\nAlso set forth in our existing senior revolving credit facility is the maximum permitted Leverage Ratio of 3.00. The following table shows the leverage ratio calculation for our most recent fiscal quarter.\n\nAll-In Cash Operating Costs\n\nThe Company defines All-In Cash Operating Costs, a non-GAAP financial measure, as \"all in cash\" costs which includes lease operating expenses, G&A costs excluding share-based compensation, interest expense, workovers and other operating expenses, production taxes, ad valorem taxes, and gathering/transportation costs. Management believes that this metric provides useful additional information to investors to assess the Company's operating costs in comparison to its peers, which may vary from company to company.\n\nA non-GAAP financial measure; see the \"Non-GAAP Information\" section in this release for more information including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.\n\nRefer to the

Reports First Quarter 2024 Results", "body": "Secured new business awards of $17.2 million in the first quarter, $80 million in our last 5 quarters.\n\n\"In the first quarter, we continued to execute our strategic transformation, which yielded continued improvement in base business profitability and additive new business wins,\" said Harold Bevis, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our trailing-twelve-month adjusted EBITDA of $46 million improved for the fourth consecutive quarter. We are increasing profits on business in house, and we have cumulatively won $80 million of new business over the last 5 quarters. This combination of results is giving us new options to optimize our performance even further. We have begun work on a laddered improvement program reaching into 2025 to continue our sequential improvement. We are balancing between cost-out and growth initiatives, and using our free cash flow to fund our business plan activities. Our cash flow generation has been historically tight due to our current capital structure, but we are improving our credit profile through this same hard work and opening opportunities to improve our capital structure and lower our cost of capital as well.\"\n\nMr. Bevis continued, \"We are further refining our targeted growth agendas and reallocating our resources in targeted areas. Our commercial performance year-to-date is on pace with our 2024 targets for new business growth at 3x market rates, and our cost improvement agenda is on track. We are pleased with our overall performance but still have many areas to improve further. Our results over the last year are encouraging us to set our goals high.\"\n\nMr. Bevis concluded, \"Our worldwide markets are mostly healthy, particularly in front of our most competitive Mobile plants in China and Brazil and in front of Power plants in the U.S. Steady investment into electric grid, electrification, and climate-friendly vehicle power trains is ongoing and good for us. The soft spots in our end-market demand are the U.S. commercial vehicle market and the U.S. residential construction markets, both small markets for us. So overall today, we have a good demand outlook across our market profile. We are comfortable with our 2024 guidance on sales, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow generation, and new business wins. I want to thank all of our employees globally who deliver beyond-reliable products every day, on-time to some of the world's most discriminating customers. Together with our customers, we are developing and producing products that improve quality of life and climate conditions for all of us.\"\n\nFirst Quarter GAAP Results\n\nNet sales were $121.2 million, a decrease of 4.6% from the first quarter of 2023, which was primarily due to non-recurring end-of-life pricing received in the first quarter of 2023, rationalized volume at plants undergoing turnarounds, and increased organic volume at healthy plants.\n\nLoss from operations was $4.8 million compared to a loss from operations of $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The decrease in loss from operations was primarily due to items related to its 2023 facility closures - (1) sublease income on closed facilities, and (2) one-time losses during the first quarter of 2023 on sales of machinery and equipment associated with these closures.\n\nFor the reporting segments, income from operations for Power Solutions was $4.0 million compared to income from operations of $1.7 million for the same period in 2023. Loss from operations for Mobile Solutions was $2.1 million compared to loss from operations of $3.3 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nNet loss was $12.5 million compared to net loss of $10.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily due to warrant valuation based on our stock price and higher interest expense, partially offset by cost reductions and higher joint venture income.\n\nFirst Quarter Adjusted Results\n\nAdjusted loss from operations for the first quarter of 2024 was $0.7 million compared to adjusted loss from operations of $0.4 million for the same period in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.3 million, or 9.3% of sales, compared to $8.1 million, or 6.4% of sales, for the same period in 2023. Adjusted net loss was $4.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023. The improvement in profitability was driven primarily by cost-out actions, partially offset by end-of-life pricing in the prior year period.\n\nFree cash flow was a generation of cash of $0.3 million compared to a use of cash of $3.7 million for the same period in 2023.\n\nPower Solutions\n\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2024 were $48.2 million compared to $49.1 million in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of 1.7%, or $0.9 million. The decrease in sales was primarily due to the non-recurrence of end-of-life pricing received during the first quarter of 2023 associated with the Irvine plant closure, partially offset by higher volume. Adjusted income from operations was $6.8 million compared to adjusted income from operations of $5.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in adjusted income from operations was primarily due to favorable product mix and improved operating performance, partially offset by the non-recurrence of end-of-life pricing in the first quarter of 2023 associated with the Irvine plant closure.\n\nMobile Solutions\n\nNet sales for the first quarter of 2024 were $73.1 million compared to $78.0 million in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of 6.4%, or $4.9 million. The decrease in sales was primarily due to rationalized volume at underperforming plants and the pass-through effect of lower raw material costs. Adjusted loss from operations was $1.2 million compared to adjusted loss from operations of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. The increase in adjusted loss from operations was due to lower volume, partially offset by cost reductions and operational improvements.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nAssuming steady end-market demand outlook, with the exception of the North American residential construction market and North American commercial vehicle market, we are confirming and slightly tightening, in part, our outlook for the full year 2024 as follows:\n\nMichael Felcher, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"Our strong transformation momentum continued in the first quarter of 2024, and we are both confirming and slightly tightening our full-year 2024 guidance ranges, which are underpinned by our operational initiatives and commercial prospecting. We are focused on generating improved profitability and strong cash flow this year. We expect our improved performance will improve our credit profile and enable opportunities to improve our balance sheet and cost of capital further.\"\n\nConference Call\n\nNN will discuss its results during its quarterly investor conference call on May 7, 2024, at 9 a.m. ET.

These statements may discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future trends, plans, events, results of operations or financial condition, or state other information relating to NN, Inc. (the \"Company\") based on current beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. Forward-looking statements generally will be accompanied by words such as \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"forecast,\" \"guidance,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"possible,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"project\" or other similar words, phrases or expressions. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are outside of management's control and that may cause actual results to be materially different from such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, general economic conditions and economic conditions in the industrial sector; the impacts of pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises, on our financial condition, business operations and liquidity; competitive influences; risks that current customers will commence or increase captive production; risks of capacity underutilization; quality issues; material changes in the costs and availability of raw materials; economic, social, political and geopolitical instability, military conflict, currency fluctuation, and other risks of doing business outside of the United States; inflationary pressures and changes in the cost or availability of materials, supply chain shortages and disruptions, the availability of labor and labor disruptions along the supply chain; our dependence on certain major customers, some of whom are not parties to long-term agreements (and/or are terminable on short notice); the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, as well as expansion of end markets and product offerings; our ability to hire or retain key personnel; the level of our indebtedness; the restrictions contained in our debt agreements; our ability to obtain financing at favorable rates, if at all, and to refinance existing debt as it matures; new laws and governmental regulations; the impact of climate change on our operations; and cyber liability or potential liability for breaches of our or our service providers' information technology systems or business operations disruptions.

New risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for the Company to predict their occurrence or how they will affect the Company. The Company qualifies all forward-looking statements by these cautionary statements.\n\nWith respect to any non-GAAP financial measures included in the following document, the accompanying information required by SEC Regulation G can be found in the back of this document or in the \"Investors\" section of the Company's web site, www.nninc.com, under the heading \"News & Events\" and subheading \"Presentations.\"\n\nThe Company discloses in this presentation the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, and free cash flow. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures provides supplementary information about the impacts of acquisition, divestiture and integration related expenses, foreign-exchange impacts on inter-company loans, reorganizational and impairment charges. The costs we incur in completing acquisitions, including the amortization of intangibles and deferred financing costs, and divestitures are excluded from these measures because their size and inconsistent frequency are unrelated to our commercial performance during the period, and we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating costs. We exclude the impact of currency translation from these measures because foreign exchange rates are not under management's control and are subject to volatility. Other non-operating charges are excluded as the charges are not indicative of our ongoing operating cost. We believe the presentation of adjusted income (loss) from operations, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per diluted common share, and free cash flow provides useful information in assessing our underlying business trends and facilitates comparison of our long-term performance over given periods.\n\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual income growth derived from income amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\n\n(a) Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from operations represents GAAP income (loss) from operations, adjusted to exclude the effects of restructuring and integration expense; non-operational charges related to acquisition and transition expense, intangible amortization costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions, non-cash impairment charges, and when applicable, our share of income from joint venture operations. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted income (loss) from operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from operations.\n\n(b) Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income (loss), adjusted to include income taxes, interest expense, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, interest rate swap payments and change in fair value that was recognized in earnings, change in fair value of preferred stock derivatives and warrants, depreciation and amortization, charges related to acquisition and transition costs, non-cash stock compensation expense, foreign exchange gain (loss) on inter-company loans, restructuring and integration expense, costs related to divested businesses and litigation settlements, income from discontinued operations, and non-cash impairment charges, to the extent applicable. We believe this presentation is commonly used by investors and professional research analysts in the valuation, comparison, rating, and investment recommendations of companies in the industrial industry. We use this information for comparative purposes within the industry. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from continuing operations.\n\n(c) This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all non-tax adjustments reflected in the respective table. NN, Inc. estimates the tax effect of the adjustment items identified in the reconciliation schedule above by applying the applicable statutory rates by tax jurisdiction unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment.\n\n(d) Non-GAAP adjusted net income (loss) represents GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude the tax-affected effects of charges related to acquisition and transition costs, foreign exchange gain (loss) on inter-company loans, restructuring and integration charges, amortization of intangibles costs for fair value step-up in values related to acquisitions and amortization of deferred financing costs, non-cash impairment charges, write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, interest rate swap payments and change in fair value, change in fair value of preferred stock derivatives and warrants, costs related to divested businesses and litigation settlements, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and preferred stock cumulative dividends and deemed dividends.

Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income attributable to the Company before (a) interest expense, net (b) (benefits) provisions for income taxes, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) costs incurred for start-up operations, including rent and excluding depreciation, interest and income taxes, (e) share-based compensation expense, (f) non-capitalizable acquisition related costs and credit allowances, (g) net costs associated with transitioning operations, (h) unusual, non-recurring or redundant charges and (i) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAR is a valuation measure applicable to current periods only and consists of net income attributable to the Company before (a) interest expense, net, (b) (benefits) provisions for income taxes, (c) depreciation and amortization, (d) rent-cost of services, (e) costs incurred for start-up operations, excluding rent, depreciation, interest and income taxes, (f) share-based compensation expense, (g) acquisition related costs and credit allowances, (h) redundant or non-recurring transition services costs, (i) costs associated with transitioning operations, (j) unusual, non-recurring or redundant charges and (j) net income attributable to noncontrolling interest. The company believes that the presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, consolidated adjusted EBITDAR, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share provides important supplemental information to management and investors to evaluate the company's operating performance. The company believes disclosure of adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and consolidated adjusted EBITDAR has economic substance because the excluded revenues and expenses are infrequent in nature and are variable in nature, or do not represent current revenues or cash expenditures. A material limitation associated with the use of these measures as compared to the GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share is that they may not be comparable with the calculation of net income and diluted earnings per share for other companies in the company's industry. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures.

(NASDAQ: COKE) today reported operating results for the first quarter ended March 29, 2024.\n\n\"Our solid first quarter results build on the improved profit margins and strong free cash flow we achieved in 2023,\" said J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our sustained strong performance gives us the confidence to announce our intended repurchase of up to $3.1 billion of our outstanding Common Stock. We believe this is an ideal time to leverage the strength of our balance sheet by taking on a prudent amount of debt to return cash to stockholders and build long-term value.\"\n\nNet sales increased 1% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Sparkling and Still net sales increased 3.4% and 0.4%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2023. Net sales growth was driven by our annual price increase that took effect during the quarter.\n\nStandard physical case volume was down 0.4%, which was attributable to an extra selling day in the first quarter of 2023. Comparable standard physical case volume increased 0.7% versus the first quarter of 2023. Comparable Sparkling category volume grew 2.0% with strong performance of multi-serve packages sold in larger retail stores. The Sparkling category also benefited from Easter holiday sales activity shifting into the first quarter of 2024. Comparable Still category volume declined 3.1% during the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGross profit in the first quarter of 2024 was $640.6 million, an increase of $16.5 million, or 3%. Gross margin improved 50 basis points to 40.2%. Pricing actions taken during the first quarter, stable commodity prices and higher Sparkling sales contributed to the overall improvement in gross margin.\n\n\"We're very pleased with our balanced profit growth and overall margin performance in the first quarter,\" said Dave Katz, President and Chief Operating Officer. \"We achieved a solid mix of volume and pricing growth while tightly managing our operating expenses. Our comparable volume growth of almost 1% reflects the continued strength of our brands and the success of new product launches such as Coke Spiced and the addition of Bang to our Energy portfolio.\"\n\nSelling, delivery and administrative (\"SD&A\") expenses in the first quarter of 2024 increased $7.1 million, or 2%. SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in SD&A expenses as compared to the first quarter of 2023 was primarily driven by an increase in labor costs related to annual wage adjustments.\n\nIncome from operations in the first quarter of 2024 was $215.4 million, compared to $206.1 million in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 5%. Operating margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 13.5% as compared to 13.1% for the first quarter of 2023, an increase of 40 basis points.\n\nNet income in the first quarter of 2024 was $165.7 million, compared to $118.1 million in the first quarter of 2023, an improvement of $47.6 million. On an adjusted basis, net income in the first quarter of 2024 was $162.5 million, compared to $151.8 million in the first quarter of 2023, an increase of $10.7 million. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2024 was $57.1 million, compared to $41.1 million in the first quarter of 2023. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 25.6%, compared to 25.8% for the first quarter of 2023.\n\nCash flows provided by operations for the first quarter of 2024 were $194.3 million, compared to $184.7 million for the first quarter of 2023. Cash flows from operations reflected our strong operating performance during the first quarter of 2024. In the first quarter of 2024, we invested $77 million in capital expenditures as we continue to enhance our supply chain and invest for future growth. For the full year of 2024, we expect our capital expenditures to be between $300 million and $350 million. During the first quarter of 2024, we made dividend payments of $155 million, which included a special dividend payment of $150 million.\n\nIntention to Repurchase Shares\n\nThe Company currently intends to purchase up to $3.1 billion in value of its Common Stock through both a modified \"Dutch auction\" tender offer for up to $2.0 billion of its Common Stock and a separate share purchase agreement (the \"Purchase Agreement\") with a subsidiary of The Coca\u2011Cola Company. The Company expects the price range for the tender offer to be $850 to $925 per share of Common Stock.\n\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, the Company has agreed to buy, and a subsidiary of The Coca\u2011Cola Company has agreed to sell, at a purchase price equal to the price paid by the Company in the tender offer, a number of shares of Common Stock such that The Coca\u2011Cola Company would beneficially own 21.5% of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock after the repurchase and completion of the tender offer. The purchase of shares under the Purchase Agreement is conditioned on the purchase price applicable to the tender offer and the Share Repurchase being no less than $925 per share. Should the applicable price in the tender offer be less than $925 per share, The Coca\u2011Cola Company shall have the option, but not the obligation, to sell their shares at that price. The tender offer is expected to be launched on or about May 20, 2024 and the purchase of shares under the Purchase Agreement is expected to occur on the 11 business day following the expiration of the tender offer.\n\n\"We believe that the proposed share repurchase enables us to optimize our balance sheet by raising a prudent amount of debt in order to return cash to stockholders,\" said Mr. Harrison. \"We intend to utilize our solid financial position and projected strong cash flow to delever over the coming years while maintaining our current regular quarterly dividend and a solid investment grade rating profile.\"\n\nJ. Frank Harrison, III will not participate in the tender offer with respect to the Common Stock he beneficially owns.\n\nThe Company intends to fund the repurchase with a combination of new funded debt and cash on hand.\n\nA PDF accompanying this release is available at: http://ml.globenewswire.com/Resource/Download/861a9ae2-3a03-49d2-8559- ...\n\nAbout Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc.\n\nCoca\u2011Cola Consolidated is the largest Coca\u2011Cola bottler in the United States.

('Chorus') (TSX: CHR) today announced its first quarter 2024 financial results.\n\n\"Throughout the first quarter, Chorus continued to perform well and delivered results in line with our guidance. We made solid progress on debt reduction and generation of cash flows from operations and asset sales,\" said Colin Copp , President and Chief Executive Officer, Chorus. \"Chorus generated Free Cash Flow of $102.1 million compared to $73.1 million in Q1 2023, and improved its Leverage Ratio to 3.4 at March 31, 2024 from 3.6 at December 31 , 2023.\"\n\n\"We expect continued strong cash generation and are increasing our 2024 guidance for consolidated Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as well as the majority of guidance for RAL, including net proceeds from asset sales,\" commented Mr. Copp.\n\n\"Improving value for our shareholders is our top priority. We acknowledge the pace of transitioning our leasing business to an asset light model has been slow. As such, we have been working hard for several months to explore options to accelerate the monetization of the asset value in our leasing business,\" said Mr. Copp.\n\n\"Between November 2022 and March 2024 , we repurchased and cancelled 10.5 million shares, representing 5.2% of the outstanding shares at the time of the NCIB launch in 2022,\" continued Mr. Copp. \"In the first quarter of 2024, the average price for shares we purchased under the NCIB was $2.06 . At our current market price, we intend to continue to utilize our NCIB.\"\n\nFirst Quarter Summary\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Chorus reported Adjusted EBITDA of $109.1 million , a decrease of $9.0 million compared to the first quarter of 2023.\n\nThe RAL segment's Adjusted EBITDA was $55.0 million , a decrease of $6.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to:\n\na decrease in lease revenue of $9.9 million primarily due to lower market lease rates on re-leased aircraft, lower maintenance reserve releases and the sale of aircraft in 2024; and increased general administrative expense; partially offset by a decrease in expected credit loss (\"ECL \") provisions of $3.1 million due to improved credit ratings on certain lessees; and an increase in the net gain on sale of assets of $3.0 million . The RAS segment's Adjusted EBITDA was $62.4 million , a decrease of $1.5 million compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to:\n\na decrease in aircraft leasing revenue under the CPA of $4.5 million primarily due to a change in lease rates on certain aircraft; and a decrease in other revenue of $1.6 million primarily due to Voyageur's decreased revenue in parts sales, contract flying and MRO activity; partially offset by an improvement in the Controllable Cost Guardrail of $2.0 million ; and an increase in capitalization of major maintenance overhauls on owned aircraft of $1.9 million . Corporate Adjusted EBITDA was $(8.4) million compared to $(7.4) million in the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation of $1.2 million due to the change in fair value of the Total Return Swap offset by a decrease in the Common Share price.\n\nAdjusted Net Income was $24.1 million for the quarter, a decrease of $6.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to:\n\na $9.0 million decrease in Adjusted EBITDA as previously described; an increase in depreciation expense of $4.7 million primarily attributable to a change in depreciation estimates on certain aircraft and capital expenditures; and a negative change in foreign exchange of $2.0 million ; partially offset by a decrease of $5.1 million in income tax expense; a decrease in net interest costs of $3.0 million ; and a positive change in the fair value on investments and derivatives of $0.9 million . Net income decreased $19.7 million compared to the first quarter of 2023 primarily due to:\n\nthe previously noted decrease in Adjusted Net Income of $6.7 million ; and a negative change in net unrealized foreign exchange of $14.6 million ; partially offset by a decrease in lease repossession costs of $1.6 million . Consolidated Financial Analysis\n\nThis section provides detailed information about Chorus' performance for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.\n\nGain on fair value of investments and derivatives(1)\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n\n(Loss) earnings attributable to Common Shareholders\n\nIncludes fair value of the New Notes received pursuant to the Azul Restructuring.\n\n(2)\n\nThese are non-GAAP financial measures that are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP.

This outlook is provided for the purpose of providing information about current expectations for 2024. Forecast information has also been provided for 2025 and 2026 for Jazz. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes.\n\nChorus' forecast for the year ending December 31, 2024 has been updated from the fourth quarter 2023 forecast due to i) an expected increase in the foreign exchange rate from 1.3200 to 1.3400; ii) reflect actual maintenance reserve releases in the first quarter of 2024 of $3.1 million and iii) additional anticipated aircraft sales. The revised forecast improved as follows:\n\nThe forecast uses a foreign exchange rate of 1.3400 for 2024 to translate USD to CAD.\n\n(2)\n\nThese are non-GAAP financial measures or non-GAAP ratios that are not recognized measures for financial statement presentation under GAAP. As such, they do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\n\n(3)\n\nThe forecast is based on projected earnings under existing contracts, expected asset sales in 2024 and future market lease rates for lease renewals and extensions.\n\n(4)\n\nThe forecast is based on the contractual nature of Chorus' earnings, amortizing debt repayments and expected asset sales. Deleveraging amounts will vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing and quantum of asset sales.\n\nJazz\n\nThe CPA provides a Fixed Margin to Jazz regardless of flying levels; therefore, any variations in flying are not expected to have any impact on Jazz's earnings. In addition, Jazz receives compensation for aircraft leased under the CPA that generates predictable Free Cash Flows. Jazz aircraft have amortizing debt that will be fully paid-off at the end of the original lease term under the CPA. At the end of each lease, Jazz will either extend the lease, sell or part-out each aircraft. Subsequent aircraft leases will continue to produce predictable Free Cash Flow at lower rates as the aircraft will be unencumbered.\n\nTotal Fixed Margin and Aircraft leasing under the CPA\n\nWholly-owned aircraft leased under the CPA (end of\n\nWholly-owned aircraft leased under the CPA available for\n\nThe forecast uses a foreign exchange rate of 1.3400 for 2024 and 1.2700 for 2025 and 2026 to translate USD to CAD.\n\n(2)\n\nIncludes estimates for future market lease rates for 12 Q400's for 2026.\n\nRAL\n\nRAL continues to execute on its asset light leasing strategy which consists of monetizing select on-balance sheet aircraft while growing its contractual fund management business. Maximizing cash flow generation from existing aircraft through lease term extensions is also a key element of RAL's business model.\n\nDepreciation and amortization excluding impairment(3)\n\nThe forecast uses a foreign exchange rate of 1.3400 for 2024 to translate USD to CAD.\n\n(2)\n\nThe forecast reflects: a) the expected sale of nine CRJ900 engines; b) the sale of two A220-300's; c) additional anticipated aircraft sales; and d) certain assumptions and estimates for future market lease rates related to new and extended leases. The forecast does not include end-of-lease compensation or maintenance reserve releases beyond first quarter actual 2024.\n\n(3)\n\nThe depreciation excluding impairment and net interest expense forecast is based on the normal amortization of aircraft and long-term debt and the expected sale of assets in 2024.\n\n(4)\n\nThe forecasted gain on fair value of the Fund II investment is based on expectations related to the trading and general financial condition of the investment to compute the value of the discounted cash flows.\n\nFund III is anticipated to close by the end of the 2024 year and is expected to have (i) a minimum of US $500.0 million in capital commitments and (ii) management fees and economic terms commensurate with those in Falko's existing investment funds.\n\nChorus intends to opportunistically trade RAL's wholly-owned or majority-owned aircraft including in connection with the windup of its 67.45% ownership in Ravelin Holdings LP by the tenth anniversary of the commencement of Fund I (2025). As of March 31, 2024 , Ravelin Holdings LP held an interest in 38 aircraft with a net book value of US $374.5 million and secured debt of US $182.8 million . As asset sales occur, the related leasing revenues in RAL will decrease, which will be partially offset by lower depreciation and debt servicing costs and earnings from Falko managed funds.\n\nRAL Receivables\n\nChorus participated in the Azul S.A. (\"Azul \") restructuring which was finalized on February 29, 2024 . The transaction includes the settlement of certain accounts receivable with a carrying value of US $22.4 million at February 29, 2024 (\"Existing AR \"), held by RAL and the granting of certain modifications related to the operating leases with Azul (\"Azul Restructuring \").\n\nIn exchange for the Existing AR, RAL received new notes on February 29, 2024 with a carrying value of US $56.2 million (\"New Notes \"), inclusive of deferred revenue of US $33.8 million related to lease modifications, from Azul which are due at various dates beginning in March 2024 and ending in October 2027 . In addition, certain of the New Notes may be settled, at Azul's option, in cash or through the issuance of Azul's publicly listed preferred shares.\n\nRAL's gross receivable, excluding long-term New Notes, primarily related to rent relief arrangements, may decrease from the March 31, 2024 balance of US $81.9 million to between US $60.0 million and US $65.0 million by the end of 2024 based on management's current repayment expectations.\n\nRAL's gross receivable exposure is partially mitigated by security packages held of approximately US $18 .0 million (December 31, 2023 - US $20.4 million ).\n\nNew Notes include US $12.9 million which are repayable in equal monthly instalments over the remainder of 2024 and US $43.9 million which may be settled, at Azul's option, in cash or by the issuance of Azul's publicly listed preferred shares in 12 quarterly instalments beginning January 1, 2025.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures in 2024 are expected to be as follows:\n\nCapital expenditures, excluding aircraft acquisitions\n\nThe 2024 plan includes between $7.0 million to $11.0 million of costs that are expected to be included in Controllable Costs.\n\nUse of Defined Terms\n\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this news release have the meanings given to them in management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition (\"MD&A\") dated the date hereof, which is available on Chorus' website (www.chorusaviation.com ) and under Chorus' profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca ).\n\nInvestor Conference Call / Audio Webcast\n\nChorus will hold an analyst call at 9:00 AM ET on May 7, 2024 to discuss the first quarter 2024 financial results. The call may be accessed by dialing 1-888-664-6392.

Chorus uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate and assess performance. These non-GAAP measures are generally numerical measures of Chorus' financial performance, financial position, or cash flows, that include or exclude amounts from the most comparable GAAP measure. As such, these measures are not recognized for financial statement presentation under GAAP, do not have standardized meanings, may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other entities, and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. For further information on non-GAAP measures used in this news release, please refer to Section 18 (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) of the MD&A dated the date hereof, which is available on Chorus' website (www.chorusaviation.com ) and under Chorus' profile on SEDAR+ (www.sedarplus.ca ). Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their nearest GAAP measures are provided below.\n\nAdjusted net income, Adjusted EBT, Adjusted EBITDA\n\nDepreciation and amortization excluding impairment\n\n(Gain) loss on fair value of investments and derivatives(2)\n\nIncludes fair value of the New Notes received pursuant to the Azul Restructuring.\n\nAdjusted earnings available to Common Shareholders per Common Share\n\nAdjusted earnings available to Common Shareholders per Common Share is used by Chorus to assess performance and is calculated as Adjusted net income less non-controlling interest and Preferred Share dividends declared.\n\n(unaudited)\n\n(expressed in thousands of Canadian dollars, except per Share amounts)\n\nAdd (Deduct) items to get to Adjusted Earnings available to\n\nCommon Shareholders\n\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n\nAdjusted Earnings available to Common Shareholders\n\nAdjusted Earnings available to Common Shareholders per\n\nLeverage Ratio is used by Chorus as a means to measure financial leverage. Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Net debt by trailing 12-month Adjusted EBITDA. Management believes Leverage Ratio to be a useful ratio when monitoring and managing debt levels. In addition, as leverage is a measure frequently analyzed for public companies, Chorus has calculated the amount to assist readers in this review. Leverage Ratio should not be construed as a measure of cash flows. Net debt is a key component of capital management for Chorus and provides management with a measure of its net indebtedness.\n\nLong-term debt and lease liabilities (including current portion)\n\nFree Cash Flow is a non-GAAP measure used as an indicator of financial strength and performance. Chorus believes that this measurement is useful as an indicator of its ability to service its debt, meet other ongoing obligations and reinvest in the Corporation and return capital to Common Shareholders. Readers are cautioned that Free Cash Flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less net changes in non-cash balances related to operations, capital expenditures excluding aircraft acquisitions and improvements plus net proceeds on asset sales (proceeds on disposal of property and equipment less the related debt repayments for the assets sold).\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to cash flows from operating activities, which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP:\n\nNet changes in non-cash balances related to operations\n\nCapital expenditures, excluding aircraft acquisitions\n\nThis news release includes forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws (collectively, \"forward-looking information\").

The decision comes one day after Digital Music News published a list of 37 white supremacist musicians still available to stream on the platform. Now, a Spotify spokesperson has confirmed to Billboard that several of the artists have pulled from streaming, while others are under review.\n\nIn 2014, the Southern Poverty Law Center published a report on racism and digital music titled Music, Money, and Hate. It concluded that there were at least 54 white supremacist bands selling music on iTunes that Apple was profiting from. Apple responded to the report by removing the bands, but SPLC noted at the time that Spotify and Amazon were slow to do the same.\n\nSpotify claims it wasn't aware these bands were on its platform.\n\n\"Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention,\" a Spotify spokesperson said in a statement to Billboard. \"We are glad to have been alerted to this content -- and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder.\"\n\nThe removal of the bands follows a violent rally of white nationalists and neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, VA this past weekend.\n\nSpotify hosts millions of bands and musicians, and although many of those come through a label or distributor, licensing companies like TuneCore and CD Baby allow anyone to easily and cheaply put their music on Spotify, with little friction from Spotify itself.\n\nBut even if Spotify doesn't review every band that shows up on its platform, some of its built-in tools aren't helping matters. Digital Music News reporter Paul Resnikoff notes that it was simple to find white supremacist bands on Spotify because of the streaming service's recommendation algorithm. Once you find one band, Spotify basically sends the rest your way. Spotify is considering ways to block these recommendations in the future, according to Billboard.\n\nAs of now, many of the hate bands discovered by Digital Music News are still available to stream on Spotify, but several have empty artist pages with no music.

Many are wondering why Spotify didn't act on the issue sooner, much like our President of the United States. Whatever the reason may be, Spotify has already started going through their immense catalog and deleting known racist and \"hate bands\" while asking users to report anything that they might find to be racist. Sure enough, a cursory search through the streaming giant yields no results for popular hate bands such as Screwdriver and Wyatt Power.\n\nBillboard reports that the move came after Digital Music News posted a story headlined \"I Just Found 27 White Supremacist Hate bands On Spotify,\" bringing the content to Spotify's attention. A Spotify spokeswoman told Billboard in a statement that the music comes to them from a variety of sites and record labels and they are the ones who are immediately responsible for the music ending up on the streaming platform. The spokesperson went on to say that Spotify does not tolerate hate music. The statement reads.\n\n\"Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us. Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention. We are glad to have been alerted to this content, and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder,\"\n\nApple Music and other streaming companies are expected to follow suit as many in the tech industry are against the current administration and their flirting with white supremacists in public. Reddit and Facebook are already actively removing hate groups from their platforms and condemned the acts in Charlottesville before the President of the United States. Even tech leaders serving under the President have started to resign over the flirtations with the so called \"alt-right\" movement.\n\nThis is a good idea in theory, but it is also a very slippery slope when it comes to music. There have been many musical acts over the years that have offended people at least once for outrageous and hurtful lyrics over the years. Will Spotify go in and take out the Guns N' Roses song \"One in a Million\" from their service? The song openly attacks sexuality, immigration, and racism in just a few short minutes. What about certain tracks by N.W.A. that spread homophobia and sexism? The list could go on forever, but the real question is: Where do you draw the line?\n\nMany applaud Spotify for taking a stand against hate as they should, but it looks like they may have to go deeper than they thought in assessing what hateful music is. But, this is an important step in fighting against hate in the world and it's important to not let any of those domestic terrorists have a voice, no matter what the Idiot in Chief says. Spotify isn't scared of losing some subscribers, why is the President?", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 920, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 921, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "wgt": 100, "id": 922, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology", "wgt": 100, "id": 968, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302847", "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304262", "label": {"eng": "President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "306414", "label": {"eng": "Subreddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306872", "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N'_Roses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "335187", "label": {"eng": "Guns N' Roses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_on-demand_streaming_music_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "374104", "label": {"eng": "Comparison of on-demand streaming music services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1268917", "label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1272775", "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}]}

Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans,\" he wrote.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302614", "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "303414", "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309388", "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "373025", "label": {"eng": "Hate group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "415285", "label": {"eng": "Supremacism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

Those artists were first flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center, a left-leaning group researching extremism, in 2014.\n\nIn response to the article, Spotify's press office said in a statement that it removes material \"that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality\" as soon as it is \"brought to our attention.\"\n\nOf the 37 bands Digital Music News found, Spotify said it removed several while the rest were under review. Already, many artists on the list appear to have artist pages on the platform, but no songs.\n\nBands that have been removed or are under view include Blood Red Eagle, Freikorps, Skinfull and Skull Head.\n\nSpotify may also start blocking white supremacist bands from being recommended by its algorithms, Billboard reported.\n\nThe SPLC first singled out bands that identify with the White Power movement or have racist lyrics in 2014, but at the time targeted Apple's iTunes, which started to remove the music, according to the SPLC. The organization also noted at the time that Amazon was slower to react.\n\nNeither Google, which operates Google Play, nor Amazon immediately responded to requests for comment. Some of the bands identified by the SPLC are available on their sites.\n\nSpotify pulled the songs just days after a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Va. turned violent over the weekend. The incident has become a tipping point for technology and social media companies, who in the wake of the protest have begun removing white supremacists and Neo-Nazis from their platforms.\n\nThe music streaming service is continuing its activist streak. In January, the company made playlists supporting refugees after president Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x5XtcH", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302545", "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305393", "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306750", "label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_on-demand_streaming_music_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "374104", "label": {"eng": "Comparison of on-demand streaming music services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "394340", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "548743", "label": {"eng": "Freikorps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

Most of these groups found on Spotify had only fringe followings.\n\nShortly after the article was posted, Spotify swiftly kicked out the listed hate bands. Spotify explained to Billboard that while the addition of bands and records are primarily handled by record companies and aggregators, \"illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us.\"\n\n\"Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention,\" the company said. \"We are glad to have been alerted to this content -- and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder.\"\n\nThe SPLC report from 2014 primarily focused on hate bands listed in the iTunes Store, which Apple ultimately removed. But with the rise of streaming services such as Spotify, many of the blacklisted bands were able to spread their discography to various platforms.\n\nAnother music streaming platform, Deezer, proactively took down hate bands found in its platform after the Digital Music News article was published.\n\n\"Deezer does not condone any type of discrimination or form of hate against individuals or groups because of their race, religion, gender or sexuality,\" said Deezer in a statement. \"We are in the process of swiftly and actively reviewing the content on our platform and have begun and will continue to remove any material that is in any way connected to any white supremacist movement or belief system.\"\n\nIt is unclear if Apple Music or other competing services have done similar takedowns in the days after Charlottesville.\n\nApple has not yet responded to our request for comment.\n\nBut Apple has taken a stance. Apple has blocked Apple Pay on sites promoting white supremacy.\n\nAnd Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday wrote a letter to his employees denouncing white supremacists and announced that the company will be donating $1 milion to SPLC and $1 million to the Anti-Defamation League. He also mentioned that he disagreed with President Donald Trump's handling after the Charlottesville attacks and his views of \"many sides\" causing the violence that killed one woman.\n\n\"I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights.

Spotify is the latest company that is exercising its free speech by not giving the hate music of white supremacy a safe haven.\n\nSpotify has a lot of major-label players when it comes to the music it offers, but it also provides a platform for more independent artists to sell their music, which is great 99% of the time. Sometimes, some heinous stuff slips through the cracks and it's difficult to keep track of. However, it's good to know that when this happens, and Spotify comes to know about it, they take swift action to shut it down.\n\nThree years ago, in response to iTunes' music catalog, the Southern Poverty Law Center published an article on all the white supremacist bands that were selling music on iTunes -- 54 total -- and were examining the fact that just when these bands were starting to die along with traditional music release and flagging concert sales, a service like iTunes provided a lifeline by allowing these bands a platform through which they could sell their music, making money that directly supports the white power movement.\n\nSpotify was not immune then. In this Pando article from the same year, writer David Holmes also checked out Spotify to see what the hate music situation was over there. Of the 54 bands that the SPLC identified at iTunes, 33 of them were found at Spotify. When asked about it, Holmes was relieved to learn that, at the very least, the Swedish company had a metric in place for banning hate music. Spotify said in a statement then:\n\n\"We take this very seriously. Content (artists and music) listed by the BPjM in Germany (Bundespr\u00fcfstelle f\u00fcr jugendgef\u00e4hrdende Medien/Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons) is proactively removed from our service. We're a global company, so we use the BPjM index as a global standard for these issues. Other potentially hateful or objectionable content that is flagged by uses or others but not on the BPjM list is handled on a case by case basis.\"\n\nHowever, another article was needed three years later to get them to take further action. A couple of days ago, Digital Music News posted an article about finding 37 hate bands on Spotify. Again, the response from Spotify was swift. They said in a statement:\n\n\"Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention. We are glad to have been alerted to this content -- and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder.\"\n\nMusic streaming service Deezer also reached out to DMN to assert its commitment to fighting white supremacy, saying:\n\n\"Deezer does not condone any type of discrimination or form of hate against individuals or groups because of their race, religion, gender or sexuality. We are in the process of swiftly and actively reviewing the content on our platform and have begun and will continue to remove any material that is in any way connected to any white supremacist movement or belief system.\"\n\nWhite supremacy is getting more bold, but this does not mean that they should ever be legitimized, artistically or otherwise. It's certainly difficult to provide a platform for both mainstream and independent artists without questionable independent artists sneaking in through the cracks. What matters is that these platforms take quick action once they know about them and quash them as if they're playing some kinda Racist Whack-a-Mole.\n\nYou know what else matters? All of us. Consumers of pop culture. Spotify took action because websites in their industry wrote about finding hate music there. Companies might be unaware of what's going on, so it's up to us to be vigilant, speak up and, to use NYC subway parlance, if you see something, say something.\n\nWhite supremacy will only be destroyed if all of us do our part to say Not here.

When I grew up, there were things you didn't hear about unless you went underground, or messages that didn't get out unless artists took a DIY initiative,\" he continued. \"I think that's what those with fringe ideas and perspectives are gonna have to do as platforms like Spotify and YouTube become more stringent with what is and isn't allowed on their sites.\"\n\n\"Spotify won't let you on? Start your own site. Host your own shit. At the beginning, the Internet was all about doing it yourself, and now everyone is just a little too dependent on the powers that be,\" Fantano explained. \"You're allowed to have your nasty music, but nobody has to like it or host it if they don't want to. If the right is concerned with this kind of speech being censored, the only answer would be to nationalize these platforms and apply the same free speech laws to them that the US government runs by, but that's basically eroding market interests, isn't it?\"", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302574", "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_recording_and_reproduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302809", "label": {"eng": "Sound recording and reproduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302847", "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302869", "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punk_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303193", "label": {"eng": "Punk rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307666", "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314513", "label": {"eng": "Popular music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "363209", "label": {"eng": "Marching band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glam_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "371471", "label": {"eng": "Glam metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "394340", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "444202", "label": {"eng": "Death metal"}}]}

The center shared a list of white supremacist groups in 2014 after discovering many of them were available on iTunes.\n\nWithin weeks, Apple began pulling the bands. As of Wednesday, the majority are not available on the U.S. site.

But it promises to take \"immediate action\" against tracks that violate its policies, once brought to light.\n\nWhile it continues to review the hateful tracks, the company has added a new, pointedly curated playlist of its own. Titled \"Patriotic Passion,\" the list features songs by Jimi Hendrix, James Brown and others, encouraging listeners to learn more about \"upholding American values\" by visiting the SPLC's website.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302847", "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307666", "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

The organization's article described the ways Apple's billion-dollar platform was incidentally propping up an ailing racist music industry (which had been driven underground years before in Europe) and encouraged Apple to purge its library of the hateful groups. By December 2014, they'd removed 30. For years, Spotify has been slow to do the same -- until now.\n\nFollowing the violence that took place Saturday in Charlottesville, Virginia, during the \"Unite the Right\" protest organized by self-described \"pro-white\" activist Jason Kessler, individuals across the web began calling out Spotify for playing host to racist bands. On Monday, the Digital Music Times catalogued 37 \"white supremacist hate bands\" whose music could still be found on the Stockholm-based streaming service.\n\nTheir list includes 29 artists from SPLC's original 2014 list. Among the bands mentioned by the Digital Music Times are Ad Hominem -- whose song \"Impaled Muhammad\" makes some pretty clear calls for violence against Muslims (\"Let's burn the Quran / And its Mullahs\") -- and Broadsword, whose \"Loyal to the Cause\" denounces race mixing and looks ahead to a \"new dawn\" that \"brings a whiter, brighter day.\"\n\nMic reached out to Spotify to ask the company if it had seen these calls to remove the bands' music and planned to take any action. Spotify responded via email and said it has begun to purge some of the bands from its service and are glad to have been \"alerted to this content.\"\n\n\"The music in our catalog comes from hundreds of thousands of record companies and aggregators all over the world, and those are ... responsible for the content they deliver,\" a Spotify spokesperson wrote. \"Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us. Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention. We are glad to have been alerted to this content and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder.\"\n\nAt the time of publication, both Ad Hominem and Broadsword were still playable on the service, along with 27 other acts featured on the Digital Music Times' list.\n\nThis is hardly the first time Spotify has been alerted to the existence of this kind of content. In December 2014, the company sent a statement to the Daily Beast describing its process for flagging and removing such music.\n\nWe take this very seriously. Content (artists and music) listed by the BPjM in Germany (Bundespr\u00fcfstelle f\u00fcr jugendgef\u00e4hrdende Medien/Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons) is proactively removed from our service. We're a global company, so we use the BPjM index as a global standard for these issues. Other potentially hateful or objectionable content that is flagged by uses or others but not on the BPjM list is handled on a case-by-case basis.\n\nOn its site, the BPjM states that it specifically objects to media that engages in the \"violation of human dignity, discrimination against groups of people, glorification/trivialization of national socialism,\" among other things. Spotify's artist terms of use similarly objects to content that is \"offensive, abusive, defamatory, pornographic, threatening or obscene\" or that which \"advocates or incites violence.\"\n\nMusic has proved to be a particularly effective recruiting and revenue-driving tool for white supremacists over the years. In a 2012 interview with the New York Times, Mark Pitcavage, director of investigative research at the Anti-Defamation League, called white power music \"one of the pillars of the white supremacist subculture\" and a clear way to \"motivate people to action\" and \"rouse resentment.\"\n\nKeegan Hankes, an analyst with the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project, agrees.\n\n\"For one thing, hate music has long been one of the most effective recruiting tools on the racist right,\" he said in a phone conversation. \"Any platform that's allowing them to make money off this is obviously problematic. A little bit of money goes a really long way in this movement.\"\n\nHankes, who said he's worked with Spotify in the past to remove blatantly hateful music, praised the streaming for beginning to take steps to scrub more racist groups from their library.\n\n\"It's great that they're taking initiative; it's something that they should be taking seriously,\" he said. \"Honestly, other companies such as Apple have taken really decisive action about hate music on their platforms. After we released that [2014] story, Apple just unilaterally made the decision before any of these other companies did, to not put up with it. It's encouraging to see Spotify doing something similar.\"\n\nThe world's largest streaming service isn't the only company taking a careful look at its content and user base. Earlier in the week, tech giants Go Daddy and Google banned the neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer from hosting its domain on their platforms, while the gaming chat service Discord shuttered its \"alt-right\" server.\n\nSpotify's task in rooting out pockets of white supremacy in its streaming library is significantly more difficult, but not impossible. Many of the bands are connected via the \"related artists\" section: Broadsword's related artists page leads to other acts who were highlighted by both the SPLC and the Digital Music Times, including Blood Red Eagle and the Legion of St. George; the most-played song by the latter is the aptly titled \"Racist.\"\n\nHankes said for the most part, Spotify tends to rely on the expertise of groups like the SPLC for flagging these kinds of bands for them.\n\n\"We'll provide samples of their lyrics, or their artwork, or if they're 'Sieg Heil'-ing at shows,\" he said, \"and they'll make a decision about whether that's allowed on their platform.\"\n\nMic will be monitoring Spotify's progress removing the acts in question. We will update this story as needed.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100, "id": 687, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 920, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc", "id": "56"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Sweden"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stockholm"}, "type": "loc", "id": "94892"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302844", "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302847", "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303936", "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304368", "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306436", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308054", "label": {"eng": "Quran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Defamation_League", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "318687", "label": {"eng": "Anti-Defamation League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pitcavage", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "451573", "label": {"eng": "Mark Pitcavage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Department_for_Media_Harmful_to_Young_Persons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "734510", "label": {"eng": "Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_power_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1214787", "label": {"eng": "White power music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1268917", "label": {"eng": "Alt-right"}}]}

Those artists were first flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), a group that researches extremism, in 2014.\n\nIn response to the article, Spotify's press office said in a statement that it removes material \"that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality\" as soon as it is \"brought to our attention.\" Billboard first reported the removal.\n\nOf the 37 bands Digital Music News found, Spotify said it removed several while the rest were under review. Already, many artists on the list appear to have artist pages on the platform, but no songs.\n\nBands that have been removed or are under view include Blood Red Eagle, Freikorps, Skinfull and Skull Head.\n\nSpotify may also start blocking white supremacist bands from being recommended by its algorithms, Billboard reported.\n\nThe SPLC first singled out bands that identify with the White Power movement or have racist lyrics in 2014, but at the time targeted Apple's iTunes, which started to remove the music, according to the SPLC. The organization also noted at the time that Amazon was slower to react.\n\nNeither Google, which operates Google Play, nor Amazon immediately responded to requests for comment. Some of the bands identified by the SPLC are available on their sites.\n\nSpotify pulled the songs just days after a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville, Va. turned violent over the weekend. The incident has become a tipping point for technology and social media companies, who in the wake of the protest have begun removing white supremacists and Neo-Nazis from their platforms.\n\nThe music streaming service is continuing its activist streak. In January, the company made playlists supporting refugees after president Donald Trump's travel ban.\n\n\u00a9 2017 USATODAY.COM\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100, "id": 687, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "wgt": 100, "id": 922, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302545", "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302691", "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305393", "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306750", "label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_on-demand_streaming_music_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "374104", "label": {"eng": "Comparison of on-demand streaming music services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "394340", "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "548743", "label": {"eng": "Freikorps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}]}

Currently, if a user finds and listens to a white supremacist artist or band, Spotify will suggest more artist similar to that one, providing more potential for discovery of other hate bands.\n\nThe hate bands identified by the SPLC come from a 2014 report on hate groups and digital music published by the organization called \"Music, Money and Hate.\" The report accused a number of tech companies of profiting off of hate groups.\n\nThe report identified at least 54 white supremacist bands who made music available on iTunes and found streaming platforms were also hosting a number of those groups. Apple responded to the report by removing the bands. Spotify and Amazon were slow to respond when the report was published and allowed some of the groups to remain.\n\nSpotify's decision to remove and review a number of hate groups hosted on its platform comes just days after web host GoDaddy and Google decided to ban white supremacist group Daily Stormer from using its services.\n\nDaily Stormer was sent packing by GoDaddy after the site posted a controversial and incendiary article about the victim of a vehicular attack carried out by a white supremacist during protests that took place in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nThe article used a number of derogatory and demeaning terms to describe Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old who was killed by a white supremacist while protesting against hate groups. The article also praised the neo-Nazi who drove his car into a crowd of protesters, injuring dozens and killing Heyer, calling him a \"straight player.\"\n\nGoogle joined GoDaddy in removing the the white supremacist site from its service after the owners of Daily Stormer attempted to move the domain to Google Domains. The search giant said white supremacist group violated the company's terms of service and rejected its request to host its domain.\n\nAs Daily Stormer attempted to find a new host for its domain, eventually settling on a Russian domain name, the group also had its subscription to content delivery network Cloudflare canceled, leaving it vulnerable to denial of service attacks.\n\nVideo game-center communications platform Discord also took action to remove be white supremacist users and servers from its platform, including a server used by AltRight.com, a white nationalist news site.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "331414", "label": {"eng": "Web hosting service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "331944", "label": {"eng": "Domain name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Daddy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "335523", "label": {"eng": "Go Daddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "373025", "label": {"eng": "Hate group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}]}

Musicians are political. This we knew. Turns out that music-streaming services, the digital platforms that are supposed to merely host all of our songs and albums, are as well.\n\nFollowing a week of tumult in American politics that began with a violent race-related protest in Charlottesville, Virginia, Spotify -- the leading on-demand music subscription company, trailing far ahead of Apple Music, Amazon, and other rivals with more than 140 million users around the world -- has removed some artists identified by activist groups as white supremacist \"hate bands\" from its service in the US.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center published a list of 37 \"white power\" artists back in 2014; a music publication resurfaced the list this week, and the bulk of the acts -- including names such as Blood Red Eagle and Tattooed Mother Fuckers -- were wiped from Spotify within the last few days.\n\n\"Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality, or the like is not tolerated by us,\" a Spotify spokesperson told Billboard.\n\nIt even followed up on its erasure of the \"hate bands\" by making a playlist called \"Patriotic Passion,\" which a spokesperson described -- in a separate statement -- as \"a soundtrack to an America worth fighting for.\"\n\nAll this comes only a few weeks after Spotify launched an audio and visual project called \"I'm With the Banned,\" supporting and promoting artists from countries affected by the US's new partial travel ban. Donald Trump's name is not mentioned once in Spotify's press release -- but it doesn't need to be, and Spotify's political views are made even clearer by the company's actions this week.\n\nWhile wary of making any overt moves at first, Silicon Valley is now, bit by bit, positioning itself decidedly against the Trump administration, with CEOs like Tim Cook openly coming out against Trump's positions and companies like CloudFlare deleting neo-Nazi news sites. Spotify is no exception.\n\nThe difference is that while companies like Uber and Intel can protest Trump's politics from a business perspective, Spotify -- which claims to champion free speech and expression, and has from the very start insisted on making all music accessible to all -- is in a much trickier situation to take a stance.\n\nNow that Spotify has laid out criteria for what music is offensive enough to be removed, will it apply the same standards to all songs in the future? Who will judge? Take, for example, Spotify's \"Patriotic Passion\" playlist, which features controversial groups like N.W.A and 2 Live Crew that could very well be argued to \"favor hatred or incite violence against race, religion, sexuality, or the like.\" Or should the newly revived Guns N' Roses be removed for one 1989 song that talks about \"niggers, immigrants, and faggots?\"\n\nBy publicly deciding to wade in and remove content, as Facebook and other platforms have recently been pressured to do, Spotify is pledging to draw some sort of line on acceptable music -- though where that line is exactly remains unclear. The company replied to Quartz's request for comment with the same statement it gave Billboard.\n\nRead this next: The US is as divided about its pop stars as everything else\n\nRead full story", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 920, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 921, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "wgt": 100, "id": 922, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302866", "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307666", "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "312006", "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_on_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312960", "label": {"eng": "Video on demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_N'_Roses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "335187", "label": {"eng": "Guns N' Roses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "426023", "label": {"eng": "N.W.A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Live_Crew", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "492418", "label": {"eng": "2 Live Crew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1272775", "label": {"eng": "Apple Music"}}]}

One notorious neo-Nazi website, The Daily Stormer, was effectively blacklisted from the entire open internet by hosting providers.\n\nIn response to the deletions, Spotify started advertising a new

On Monday, Paul Resnikoff at Digital Music News pointed out that 29 bands identified as racist by the Southern Poverty Law Center were available for listening on Spotify (as well as another eight apparently hateful artists that Resnikoff found). By Thursday, Spotify had removed many of the acts, saying that \"illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us.\"\n\nThe fact that the bands were available to stream in the first place speaks to the challenges of stemming hate speech on new, supposedly democratizing technology platforms. The SPLC's list of white-power bands that Resnikoff cited was drawn up in 2014 to bring attention to their presence on iTunes, Apple's service that sells downloads of songs and albums. Keegan Hankes wrote that \"the racist music industry, a once lucrative source of funding for the white-power movement,\" had faced challenges in distribution and funding in recent years -- but was finding new life thanks to digital downloads. Streaming, which is supplanting downloading in popularity, could create a similar dynamic.\n\nSome of the most famous white-power acts, like the band Skrewdriver, appear to have already been absent from platforms like Spotify and Apple Music (YouTube, still navigating how to handle extremist content, is another story). But the bands at issue this week are smaller, obscure ones that might slip under the radar for platforms accessible to hundreds of thousands of bands uploading music through independent distributors. \"We are glad to have been alerted to this content -- and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder,\" Spotify's representative said to Billboard. Competitors are following suit. A source close to the situation told me Thursday morning that Tidal is currently in the process of deleting many of these same bands.\n\nThe push to stop tech platforms from being used to spread white supremacy isn't limited to the music world. Buzzfeed reports that Apple Pay and Paypal have recently cut off business with a number of sites selling white-nationalist and Nazi merchandise. The hate publication Daily Stormer has now found itself without a web host after Google and GoDaddy cut ties. It briefly relocated to a Russian server but went down again after Cloudflare, a service that protects from denial-of-service attacks, dropped it as a client.\n\nMusic can be a particularly tricky, and important, font of hate for the tech world to grapple with. The white-power rock scene has a long history, as well as real associations with violence. The man who massacred six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012, for example, played in racist hardcore bands. For now, at least, the bans would seem to have a pretty clear logic -- making it harder for bands listed as hate groups by a hate-group watchdog organization to court enormous potential audiences worldwide.\n\nYet as is always the case with artistic expression, it's easy to imagine bans like this week's triggering future battles over speech rights. What happens in the case of an established band like Pantera, whose singer Phil Anselmo made a white-power salute onstage last year and then apologized for it? And how long before white nationalists take the \"both sides\" rhetorical approach used by the president to, say, advocate for the banning of aggressive or racially fraught rap lyrics? Of course, the argument being made by critics of Donald Trump's handling of Charlottesville holds here as well: The history of anti-black (and anti-brown, and anti-Semitic) oppression is so pernicious, and the power dynamics in this country so unequal, that the danger posed by organized white-power movements has no parallel.\n\nRelated Video", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302574", "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302649", "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302690", "label": {"eng": "PayPal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302762", "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302767", "label": {"eng": "Singing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302844", "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304182", "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310178", "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BuzzFeed", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "311881", "label": {"eng": "BuzzFeed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312035", "label": {"eng": "Denial-of-service attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Download", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314294", "label": {"eng": "Download"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_download", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "327551", "label": {"eng": "Music download"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_hosting_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "331414", "label": {"eng": "Web hosting service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Anselmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "343800", "label": {"eng": "Phil Anselmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "343802", "label": {"eng": "Pantera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CloudFlare", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "365692", "label": {"eng": "CloudFlare"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikh", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sikh"}, "type": "loc", "id": "375888"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}]}

White supremacists play musical instruments; sometimes, they form bands; sometimes, those bands record albums. And you can hear those albums over Spotify the same way you could an album whose lyrics didn't promote genocide and ethnic cleansing.\n\nUntil now, anyway: Responding to a Digital Music News story published yesterday titled \"I Just Found 27 White Supremacist Hate Bands on Spotify,\" Spotify has removed many of the bands listed and is busy reviewing the remainder.\n\nThe removal is part of a trend that's bigger than music. Since the deadly white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville last weekend, a recalibration has been taking place in the corporate world, many of whose leading figures have decided that they can no longer be associated with President Trump. It's not necessarily a matter of conscience. But even for organizations driven by nothing more than the profit motive, it's become clear that being tied to the 45th president is bad business for any firm that counts people of color and others who can't stand out-and-out Nazis among its customers.\n\nIt's hard not to welcome the news from Spotify. Not much can keep white supremacists from existing and making songs, but as far as keeping their brutal beliefs from spreading with ease and injuring more innocent people, certain actions can help, or at the very least can hurt less. Still, as with anything involving censorship, the process is more difficult than it looks. Outright hate speech is easy enough to identify and ban, but coded phrases, insinuations, and double entendres are harder to discern. Getting rid of white-supremacist bands will take a more arduous and concerted effort on the part of Spotify's censors, and only time will tell if the company is up to the task.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching", "wgt": 100, "id": 154, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Marching"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302813", "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304451", "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306726", "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309983", "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "310178", "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331636", "label": {"eng": "Ethnic cleansing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_motive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "556144", "label": {"eng": "Profit motive"}}]}

Google and digital music distributor CD Baby also pledged to remove music promoting hate.\n\nSpotify came under pressure after Digital Music News reported earlier this week that the service was streaming music from a number of bands highlighted in a 2014 campaign by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The anti-discrimination group had originally assembled a list of 54 bands, with explicitly racist or white supremacist messaging to pressure Apple to stop selling their music on iTunes.\n\nA lot of those bands have since transitioned to streaming, and quite a few of them were, until recently, available on Spotify. The service responded to the post by stating that it had removed \"many of the bands identified\" by Digital Music News, and that it was in the process of reviewing other bands.\n\nOther services seem ready to follow suit. Deezer told the publication that it would remove the artists in question as well. And a Google spokesperson told Variety that \"YouTube and Google Play have clear policies that prohibit content like hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts\" and that it would remove any content in violation of these policies flagged by users.\n\nHowever, the company's services also demonstrate why it's so hard for music services to filter out Nazi rock. YouTube has long offered users the ability to easily flag uploaded content. Google Play Music doesn't currently offer this feature as part of its subscription service. So there's no easy way to inform the company that it's currently streaming an album titled \"18 Was Right\" by Nazi rock band No Remorse, which features choice lines like \"Stand up and fight / be proud to be white / Hitler was right.\"\n\nWhite power music also continues to be available on Amazon, which is currently streaming multiple albums of Skrewdriver, a band that the SPLC describes as the de facto founders of the hate rock movement, as well as numerous other bands from the SPLC's list. Amazon didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt appears that music services like Spotify, Amazon Music, and Google Play Music all get these albums from indie and DIY music distributors like CD Baby, which allow any band to submit their albums and have them distributed to a long list of music services. The company told Variety Thursday that it's committed to take down any CDs featuring hate speech.\n\n\"We believe hate speech is particularly odious, and we try not to carry it, per our hate speech policy. CD Baby does not intentionally distribute content that promotes violence against persons of a specific race, color, religion, nationality, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and we reserve the right to refuse submissions of this nature, or to cancel submissions that fall into this category at any time,\" said CD Baby CEO Tracy Maddux.\n\n\"We carry over 8 million songs that hundreds of thousands of artists self-distribute on the CD Baby platform, and it is impossible to screen every song for objectionable content,\" she continued. \"Our practice has been to encourage our community to let us know if there is content available on our site that violates these guidelines. Reports of hate-promoting music are taken very seriously and we are making every effort to flag and vet tracks of concern. In the event we find content in violation of these guidelines, we will take it down.\"\n\nThe moves by these music services come as a number of tech companies are severing ties with right-wing extremists in the wake of Charlottesville. Apple Pay and PayPal both disabled support for a number of sites selling Neo-Nazi garb, GoDaddy and Google canceled their hosting contracts with The Daily Stormer, and OKCupid even banned a white supremacist from its dating service Thursday.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 921, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302574", "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302629", "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302762", "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302844", "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303413", "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303983", "label": {"eng": "Independent music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304082", "label": {"eng": "Nationality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304363", "label": {"eng": "Compact disc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304550", "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305588", "label": {"eng": "Amazon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306436", "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306750", "label": {"eng": "Google Play Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307384", "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309031", "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310178", "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "311203", "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Baby", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "729602", "label": {"eng": "CD Baby"}}]}

Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention.\"\n\nTidal, the streaming service partially owned by Jay-Z, seems to be following suit. Two \"hate bands\" NPR found on the platform on Tuesday had been removed as of Thursday morning.\n\nThe existence of racist music on music platforms isn't a new phenomenon. Nearly three years ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center pointed out to Apple and the iTunes Store that they were selling, and thereby profiting from, openly racist, neo-fascist musicians, like the hardcore band Skrewdriver.\n\nIn March 2015, the SPLC published a follow-up to its iTunes report that specifically addressed the fact that other digital platforms -- most notably, Spotify and Amazon -- were continuing to sell such music.\n\nSwift rebuke of racist content wasn't limited to listening platforms. Country music website Wide Open Country took the unorthodox step of publishing an editorial directed at any racist readers, after a roundup of country musicians' reactions to the events in Charlottesville, Va., drew polarizing criticism on social media.\n\nMatt Alpert, the website's managing editor, wrote, \"I want to make something very clear to everyone who follows us and reads this site: Wide Open Country vehemently opposes any form of racism. We stand firmly against any type of hatred, bigotry and especially any Nazi scum.\"\n\n\"I felt compelled to say something,\" Alpert told NPR. \"With this particular thing that happened in Charlottesville, we wanted to be clear about how we felt about that and where we stand. Seeing those comments, and seeing them rise to the top [of the post] ... it felt like we needed to say something.\"\n\nWriting on Facebook Wednesday, country music royalty Rosanne Cash took aim at a \"self-proclaimed neo-Nazi\" who was photographed wearing a T-shirt with Johnny Cash's face on it. \"We were sickened by the association,\" she wrote, going on to point out that her father's \"pacifism and inclusive patriotism were two of his most defining characteristics.\"\n\nFacebook also took steps this week to make it harder for racist fans to share photos like the one featuring Johnny Cash. The social network drew its own line in the sand, removing the profile pages of Christopher Cantwell, a fascist activist who promotes overthrowing the U.S. government according to the SPLC. Cantwell, who was profiled by Vice while in Charlottesville, says on video that \"we're not nonviolent; we'll f****** kill these people if we have to.\"\n\nFacebook's terms prohibit posting content it classifies as \"hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.\" The dominance of Facebook's platform helped to legitimize voices like Cantwell's through proximity to more legitimate news sources within people's feeds, a problem it says it is working to fix.\n\nIn a memo to his staff yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced his company would donate $2 million and double its employees' donations to human rights groups through Sept. 30. \"As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect,\" Cook wrote.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri":

Now music streaming services, like Spotify, are also joining the efforts to obscure white power messages and neo-Nazi groups from their platforms.\n\nThree years ago, Southern Poverty Law Center compiled a list identifying violent, white-nationalist, and hate-fueled music and groups available on Spotify.\n\nOn Monday, Digital Music News' publisher Paul Resnikoff posted the article \"I Just Found 37 White Supremacist Bands on Spotify.\" In the article, Resnikoff said there hadn't been a streamlined effort to remove these bands after the wake of the Nazi rally and terror attack in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\nSince the article came out, Spotify has started purging these bands from their streaming platform, stating \"We are glad to have been alerted to this content -- and have already removed many of the bands identified today, whilst urgently reviewing the remainder.\"\n\nMusic service Deezer has also announced its maintenance to remove white-nationalist, Nazi, or other \"hate-music\" from their services.\n\nBut both Spotify and Deezer are private companies. So this means their obligation to adhere to first amendment principles and honor their artists' rights to free speech is null in cases such as this.\n\nBut removing this vein of music isn't going to be simple. Resnikoff says a lot of the groups' lyrics or sounds convey covert racism. He says, \"I got the sense that there's a more hardcore group of bands out there that are more overt. But those would have been flagged in an earlier period.\"\n\nWithout lyrics to signal white-nationalist content, deeper research into the band's members and history might be necessary. An example of this is \"Fashwave,\" (\"Fash\" standing for fascism) music. The sound is synth-heavy with little-to-no lyrics and the political ideologies live within the sonic lining of the music. Fashwave producers, musicians, and distributors identify as fascists and are making music meant to be completely free from African rhythmic influence.\n\nResnikoff said after publishing the article on Monday, a debate sparked over how to identify hate-music in situations where the music isn't overtly supremacist. Resnikoff says:\n\nOne group that came up, that I'd listed, is this group B\u00f6lzer. Their this Swiss, extreme death metal band. I listened to their music and instrumentally it sounded pretty good. They had a pretty decent following but the leader singer has swastika tattoos and other tattoos of Nazi-era type symbols. That gets a little bit confusing because then in an interview, he denied that they had any reference to the Nazi era, that the symbols predated the Nazi period.\n\nSo you go back and forth and have to make a determination on your own about what you think. I judge that to be racist but other people didn't.\n\nIt's important to note that type of music can be found all over the world. Resnikoff says as he listened and dug through the recesses of Spotify's libraries, he was finding white-supremacist followings in Eastern Europe, Western Europe, and Austrailia.\n\nBut after Charlottesville, Resnikoff said listenership was growing, triggering Spotify's recommendation algorithm to connect listeners with more on-brand groups. He says:\n\nI knew this was an issue on YouTube. Their smart algorithms use a lot of methods for recommending other bands you might like, and a lot of that is based on what other people are listening to. That creates this 'affinity clump' which I was able to see.

Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention.\"\n\nTidal, the streaming service partially owned by Jay-Z, seems to be following suit. Two \"hate bands\" NPR found on the platform on Tuesday had been removed as of Thursday morning.\n\nThe existence of racist music on music platforms isn't a new phenomenon. Nearly three years ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) pointed out to Apple and the iTunes Store that they were selling, and thereby profiting from, openly racist, neo-fascist musicians, like the hardcore band Skrewdriver.\n\nIn March 2015, the SPLC published a follow-up to its iTunes report that specifically addressed the fact that other digital platforms -- most notably, Spotify and Amazon -- were continuing to sell such music.\n\nSwift rebuke of racist content wasn't limited to listening platforms. Country music website Wide Open Country took the unorthodox step of publishing an editorial directed at any racist readers, after a roundup of country musicians' reactions to the events in Charlottesville, Va. drew polarizing criticism on social media.\n\nMatt Alpert, the website's managing editor, wrote, \"I want to make something very clear to everyone who follows us and reads this site: Wide Open Country vehemently opposes any form of racism. We stand firmly against any type of hatred, bigotry and especially any Nazi scum.\"\n\n\"I felt compelled to say something,\" Alpert told NPR. \"With this particular thing that happened in Charlottesville, we wanted to be clear about how we felt about that and where we stand. Seeing those comments, and seeing them rise to the top [of the post] ... it felt like we needed to say something.\"\n\nWriting on Facebook yesterday, country music royalty Rosanne Cash took aim at a \"self-proclaimed neo-Nazi\" who was photographed wearing a t-shirt with Johnny Cash's face on it. \"We were sickened by the association,\" she wrote, going on to point out that her father's \"pacifism and inclusive patriotism were two of his most defining characteristics.\"\n\nFacebook also took steps this week to make it harder for racist fans to share photos like the one featuring Johnny Cash. The social network drew its own line in the sand this week, removing the profile pages of Christopher Cantwell, a fascist activist who promotes overthrowing the U.S. government, according to the SPLC. Cantwell, who was profiled by Vice while in Charlottesville, says on video that \"we're not non-violent, we'll f****** kill these people if we have to.\"\n\nFacebook's terms prohibit posting content it classifies as \"hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.\" The dominance of Facebook's platform helped to legitimize voices like Cantwell's through proximity to more legitimate news sources within people's feeds, a problem it says it is working to fix.\n\nIn a memo to his staff yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced his company would donate $2 million and double its employees' donations to human rights groups through Sept. 30. \"As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect,\" Cook wrote.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri":

It is about human decency and morality.\n\n\"I disagree with the president and others who believe that there is a moral equivalence between white supremacists and Nazis, and those who oppose them by standing up for human rights. Equating the two runs counter to our ideals as Americans,\" he added, referencing y'all's president blunder of a statement after Trump attempted to paint white supremacists and counter-demonstrations with the same brush.\n\nApple is also pledging to match two-for-one employee donations to human rights groups until the end of September, adding that it would roll out donations systems for the SPLC through iTunes.\n\nOther companies, are also banning white supremacists or the things that would appeal to them outright.\n\nLinkedIn suspended the page of nazi site the Daily Stormer, and the page belonging to Andrew Auernheimer, who is associated with the site, although the business connection site declined to comment on the suspensions.\n\nFacebook has banned prominent neo-Nazis from its site, including several white supremacist pages. Christopher Cantwell, the crybaby who was seen sobbing on camera after finding out there was a warrant out for his arrest, has been removed from both Facebook and Instagram.\n\nYouTube is starting to remove accounts linked to white supremacists, also including Cantwell.\n\nTwitter has also removed accounts affiliated with the Daily Stormer, which recently lost its domain registration this week, after GoDaddy booted it for a disgusting post that was made about Charlottesville victim, Heather Heyer.\n\nThe site moved its registration to Google, but that too was quickly shut down with a swiftness \"for violating...terms of service.\"\n\nPayPal followed next making it harder for white supremacists to fund their favorite hateful causes.\n\nAnd now the racists can't even listen to their racist music, after music-streaming service Spotify announced that it would remove \"hate music\" by white supremacists from its extensive library, as USA Today reports.\n\nSpotify decided to go ahead and nix a bunch of music after Digital Music News published a story earlier this week, identifying 37 white supremacist bands that could still be found on the streaming service.\n\nSpotify quickly released a statement saying that it removes music \"that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality\" as soon as it is brought to our attention.\n\nThe music streaming service said that it has already removed several of the identified bands, while others are still under review. As USA Today notes, many artists still appear to have artist pages on the platform, although no songs are available.\n\nThose that have been removed or are under review include the Blood Red Eagle, Freikorps, Skinfull and Skull Head.\n\nLooks like the white supremacists are going to have to go back to burning CDs, and for some reason this causes me extreme delight. I mean, if you're going to act like if you're in the 1900s...\n\nhttp://www.theroot.com/tech-companies-decide-white-supremacists-should-wear-ho-1797887411\n\nOne can only wonder which company will be next to join the fold of cutting these racists off from technology and, by extension, decent society.

Spotify began removing racist content after Digital Music News published the names of 37 white supremacy bands you can find on the platform. Most of them are included in Southern Poverty Law Center's list of racist acts you can find on streaming services and digital stores.\n\nSpotify-competitor Deezer told the publication that it's now also in the midst of \"swiftly and actively reviewing\" the songs and on its platform has begun removing \"any material that is in any way connected to any white supremacist movement or belief system.\"\n\nGoogle, one the other hand, isn't actively seeking them out. Still, it told Variety that it will remove any YouTube and Play Music offering that violates its policies against hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts. It will only take action if users report them, though, which could be a problem, since it's hard to report anything on Google Play Music. You'll have to file a form within the \"help & feedback\" menu -- there's just no intuitive way to do so.\n\nOther streaming services and stores like Amazon Music haven't revealed whether they also plan to follow suit. Even if they don't, they might get fewer and fewer new racist tracks going forward: CD Baby, one of the music distributors where the likes of Amazon, Google and Spotify get their content, has also sworn to delete racist tracks its own users flag. CEO Tracy Maddux also said that the company has the right to refuse submissions from artists if they promote hatred and violence against specific groups of people.\n\nMaddux said:\n\n\"We believe hate speech is particularly odious, and we try not to carry it, per our hate speech policy. CD Baby does not intentionally distribute content that promotes violence against persons of a specific race, color, religion, nationality, gender identity, or sexual orientation, and we reserve the right to refuse submissions of this nature, or to cancel submissions that fall into this category at any time.\n\nWe carry over 8 million songs that hundreds of thousands of artists self-distribute on the CD Baby platform, and it is impossible to screen every song for objectionable content. Our practice has been to encourage our community to let us know if there is content available on our site that violates these guidelines. Reports of hate-promoting music are taken very seriously and we are making every effort to flag and vet tracks of concern. In the event we find content in violation of these guidelines, we will take it down.\"\n\nMusic streaming platforms aren't the only entities taking action against white supremacists after the tragic events in Charlottesville. Twitter suspended the account used to promote updates posted by the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer, but only after GoDaddy dropped the domain and Google refused to host it -- actions the EFF criticized, because it's worried that the same tactic could be used against other groups of people, including ones whose opinions you agree with.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100, "id": 672, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 920, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 921, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "wgt": 100, "id": 922, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302546", "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302574", "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302718", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "302865", "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303332", "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304550", "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "305588", "label": {"eng": "Amazon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305834", "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307384", "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309031", "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "310178", "label": {"eng": "Hate speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313154", "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_distribution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324536", "label": {"eng": "Digital distribution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_music_store", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331390", "label": {"eng": "Online music store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deezer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "335336", "label": {"eng": "Deezer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play#Play_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "349228", "label": {"eng": "Google Play Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "398936", "label": {"eng": "Southern Poverty Law Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "629262", "label": {"eng": "Black supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Baby", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "729602", "label": {"eng": "CD Baby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_(human_categorization)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1083325", "label": {"eng": "Race (human categorization)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1277581", "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}]}

PayPal, another online payments service, wrote a blog post Tuesday that they have a similar policy, and work to make sure their services aren't used to promote intolerance. According to CNN, they have blocked payments to a number of accounts reported by the Southern Poverty Law Center, including the think tank of prominent white nationalist Richard Spencer.\n\nDomain name service GoDaddy says it booted neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer because it crossed the line from exercising freedom of speech to inciting violence, according to CNBC. The company gave the site 24 hours to move their domain to a different provider. And its host, French company Scaleway, terminated the Daily Stormer's account.\n\nBillboard reported Wednesday that Spotify removed several white supremacist bands after an article on Digital Music News called out 37 such bands on the service. Spotify said in a statement that the record companies are \"at first hand responsible,\" but they do their best to remove hateful content as soon as they can. \"Illegal content or material that favors hatred or incites violence against race, religion, sexuality or the like is not tolerated by us,\" the company said.\n\nThese companies have shut down larger sites and groups in the past, but the challenge now is to constantly fight smaller sites, which will likely pop up under new names to fly under the radar.

Some beautiful music has been produced out of dark places, and some really bad music has been produced from places of positivity. But the beauty of music is that it is accessible to anyone; anyone can pick up a guitar, produce a beat, or write lyrics and express themselves. But what about is there a line? And if not, should we make one? That is the question that has been at the center of the music world with the news that Spotify has removed several white supremacist bands from its catalogues.\n\nThe news comes just days after racial tensions not just flared, but all out ruptured in Charlottesville this past weekend. In case you've been completely avoiding the news (can't completely blame you), this past weekend Charlottesville was set to tear down a famous statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee amid growing national pressure to tear down national monuments honoring Confederate soldiers and leaders. In response, several loosely-affiliated groups of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the good ol' fashioned KKK banded together to protest the statue removal in a scene that was unfortunately not out of a movie. Counter-protests met the protestors, and violence inevitably erupted with one woman dead after being run over by a car.\n\nNow, several corporations have distanced themselves from Donald Trump (who has been pretty iffy on condemning the white supremacists wholly) and anything within radius of white supremacy. Among them, is Spotify, who removed several bands that were openly sympathetic to white supremacy/neo-Nazi groups/ideologies following an article titled \"I Just Found 27 White Supremacist Hate Bands on Spotify.\"\n\nThe move instantly raises the question of censorship, and free speech at large. Art has always pushed boundaries, but many feel that the line should be drawn at bands that openly support racist groups and organizations. While the answer is pretty common sense, how we got to the point that Spotify had seemingly dozens of openly and disturbingly racist groups in its catalogue is much more complicated.\n\nPunknews.org first touched on this issue nearly 11 years ago, when white power group Skrewdriver made an appearance on iTunes, the biggest music retailer in the country. The article found out that independent retailer CD Baby was the source of the album. The independent retailer sells music directly from the artists, and makes it clear that music comes directly from musicians themselves. When asked by CD Baby stocked openly racist and hateful music, owner Derek Sivers had a measured and somewhat reasonable response.\n\n\"The day I started CD Baby I made the firm decision to never censor anything,\" said Sivers.\n\n\"So - the day the first racist CD showed up here, we had to make a tough decision on whether to start censoring now, or not. Two things let to our decision not to censor: This album came to our attention because of the album cover. If it weren't for the album cover, we never would have noticed. (We can't sit and listen to every lyric of every song.) Does that mean, then, that everyone with an offense piece of artwork on their cover gets banned, but everyone with pretty rainbows on the cover does not, no matter what the lyrics inside may say?\"\n\nSivers elaborated on the \"too slippery of a slope,\" that is music censorship.\n\n\"Plus I don't want to let complainers rule our actions. What if we started getting complaints about Pagan albums? Complaints about Liberal politics albums? Do we remove anything that lots of people complain about?\"\n\nSivers made fair points, and it seems most of the music world agreed with him as Noisey also discovered racist bands (including our friend Skrewdriver) being sold on nearly every major retailer (even Rhapsody!!) as late as 2014, as protests were erupting over Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown.\n\nUnfortunately, it often takes a national tragedy or major political/social crisis for a company to take a political stance, although it's doubtful that many are upset with Spotify's decision. With Spotify taking quick and strong action, two important questions remain open: How dedicated is Spotify to continued censorship of white supremacist groups, and will the rest of the music industry follow suit?", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 58, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 100, "id": 687, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 920, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 921, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville,_Virginia", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlottesville"}, "type": "loc", "id": "200134"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302614", "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302629", "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302635", "label": {"eng": "Song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302797", "label": {"eng": "Cover version"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302825", "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302940", "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "302942", "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302948", "label": {"eng": "Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303387", "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304363", "label": {"eng": "Compact disc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305262", "label": {"eng": "Neo-Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305776", "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305960", "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306726", "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307721", "label": {"eng": "ITunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309967", "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311065", "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "318256", "label": {"eng": "Ku Klux Klan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Trayvon_Martin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "323872", "label": {"eng": "Shooting of Trayvon Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album_cover", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "330616", "label": {"eng": "Album cover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Lee", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "360432", "label": {"eng": "Robert E.

This is per Variety, which notes that the increased spotlight on white supremacist movements in America of late has summoned up an increased call for companies to keep their rosters clear of bands whose music endorses racially motivated violence.\n\nDeezer has confirmed that it's outright removing such artists from its lists, while Google has reiterated that its policies say it'll remove any hate speech or music that's flagged by its users. (Variety points out that that's presumably why songs with lyrics like \"Stand up and fight / be proud to be white / Hitler was right\" still show up on the company's services, at least for now.) Meanwhile, CD Baby -- an indie music distributor with millions of songs uploaded to it, and which is at least partially responsible for passing some of these bands along to Spotify and its ilk -- issued a statement saying that \"We believe hate speech is particularly odious, and we try not to carry it, per our hate speech policy,\" but noted that the sheer volume of traffic it receives makes it borderline impossible to filter out everything.

Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention.\"\n\nTidal, the streaming service owned by Jay-Z, seems to be following suit. Two \"hate bands\" NPR found on Tuesday had been removed as of Thursday morning.\n\nThe swift rebuke of racist content wasn't limited to listening platforms. Country music website Wide Open Country took the unorthodox step of publishing an editorial directed at any racist readers, after a roundup of country musician reactions to Charlottesville drew polarizing criticism on social media.\n\nMatt Alpert, the website's managing editor, wrote, \"I want to make something very clear to everyone who follows us and reads this site: Wide Open Country vehemently opposes any form of racism. We stand firmly against any type of hatred, bigotry, and especially any Nazi scum.\"\n\n\"I felt compelled to say something,\" Alpert told NPR. \"With this particular thing that happened in Charlottesville, we wanted to be clear about how we felt about that and where we stand. Seeing those comments, and seeing them rise to the top [of the post] ... it felt like we needed to say something.\"\n\nWriting on Facebook yesterday, country music royalty Rosanne Cash took aim at a \"self-proclaimed neo-Nazi\" wearing a t-shirt with Johnny Cash's face on it. \"We were sickened by the association,\" she wrote, going on to point out that her father's \"pacifism and inclusive patriotism were two of his most defining characteristics.\"\n\nFacebook took steps this week to make it harder for racist fans to share photos like the one featuring Johnny Cash. The social network drew its own line in the sand this week, removing the profile pages of Christopher Cantwell, a fascist activist who promotes overthrowing the U.S. government, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. Cantwell was profiled by Vice while in Charlottesville, who says on video that \"we're not non-violent, we'll f****** kill these people if we have to.\"\n\nFacebook's terms prohibit posting content it classifies as \"hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.\" The dominance of Facebook's platform, as the world learned last year, helped to legitimize voices like Cantwell's through proximity to more legitimate news sources within people's feeds, a problem it says it is working to fix.\n\nThe existence of racist music on music platforms isn't a new phenomenon. Nearly three years ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center pointed out to Apple and the iTunes Store that they were selling, and thereby profiting from, openly racist, neo-fascist musicians, like the hardcore band Skrewdriver.\n\nIn a memo to his staff yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced his company would donate $2 million and double its employees' donations to human rights groups through Sept. 30. \"As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect.\"\n\nExamples of tech's circling of the wagons in the midst of a racist storm of philosophical shrapnel abound. But the connection between Wide Open Country and Spotify is clear -- both are saying, unwaveringly: We don't want you here.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt":

Deezer and Spotify aren't alone in trying to block hate groups from its services.\n\nWe had also previously reported that companies such as Apple and PayPal were blocking support of its payment services for hate websites that were also selling racist paraphernalia.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 59, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 100, "id": 686, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Publishing", "wgt": 100, "id": 688, "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Publishing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News_and_Media", "wgt": 100, "id": 689, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/News and Media"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "wgt": 100, "id": 705, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 920, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet_Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 921, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Music/Sheet Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology", "wgt": 100, "id": 968, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Musicology"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305969", "label": {"eng": "White supremacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playlist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307666", "label": {"eng": "Playlist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307723", "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deezer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "335336", "label": {"eng": "Deezer"}}]}

Spotify takes immediate action to remove any such material as soon as it has been brought to our attention.\"\n\nTidal, the streaming service owned by Jay-Z, seems to be following suit. Two \"hate bands\" NPR found on Tuesday had been removed as of Thursday morning.\n\nThe swift rebuke of racist content wasn't limited to listening platforms. Country music website Wide Open Country took the unorthodox step of publishing an editorial directed at any racist readers, after a roundup of country musician reactions to Charlottesville drew polarizing criticism on social media.\n\nMatt Alpert, the website's managing editor, wrote \"I want to make something very clear to everyone who follows us and reads this site: Wide Open Country vehemently opposes any form of racism. We stand firmly against any type of hatred, bigotry, and especially any Nazi scum.\"\n\n\"I felt compelled to say something,\" Alpert told NPR. \"With this particular thing that happened in Charlottesville, we wanted to be clear about how we felt about that and where we stand. Seeing those comments, and seeing them rise to the top [of the post] ... it felt like we needed to say something.\"\n\nWriting on Facebook yesterday, country music royalty Rosanne Cash took aim at a \"self-proclaimed neo-Nazi\" wearing a t-shirt with Johnny Cash's face on it. \"We were sickened by the association,\" she wrote, going on to point out that her father's \"pacifism and inclusive patriotism were two of his most defining characteristics.\"\n\nFacebook took steps this week to make it harder for racist fans to share photos like the one featuring Johnny Cash. The social network drew its own line in the sand this week, removing the profile pages of Christopher Cantwell, a fascist activist who promotes overthrowing the U.S. government, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. Cantwell was profiled by Vice while in Charlottesville, who says on video that \"we're not non-violent, we'll f****** kill these people if we have to.\"\n\nFacebook's terms prohibit posting content it classifies as \"hate speech, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.\" The dominance of Facebook's platform, as the world learned last year, helped to legitimize voices like Cantwell's through proximity to more legitimate news sources within people's feeds, a problem it says it is working to fix.\n\nThe existence of racist music on music platforms isn't a new phenomenon. Nearly three years ago, the Southern Poverty Law Center pointed out to Apple and the iTunes Store that they were selling, and thereby profiting from, openly racist, neo-fascist musicians, like the hardcore band Skrewdriver.\n\nIn a memo to his staff yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced his company would donate $2 million and double its employees' donations to human rights groups through Sept. 30. \"As a company, through our actions, our products and our voice, we will always work to ensure that everyone is treated equally and with respect.\"\n\nExamples of tech's circling of the wagons in the midst of a racist storm of philosophical shrapnel abound. But the connection between Wide Open Country and Spotify is clear -- both are saying, unwaveringly: We don't want you here.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt":

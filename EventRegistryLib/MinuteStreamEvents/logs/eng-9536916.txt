The vast majority of Alzheimer's cases occur after age 65. But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \"profound implications,\" said Dr. Juan Fortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older adults who develop Alzheimer's.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning those cases \"can be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\" Fortea said. Until now, genetic forms of Alzheimer's were thought to be only types that strike at much younger ages and account for less than 1% of all cases.\n\nScientists say the research makes it critical to develop treatments that target the APOE4 gene. Some doctors won't offer the only drug that has been shown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair because they're especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer's and \"this data for me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they become symptomatic.\"\n\nBut the news doesn't mean people should race for a gene test. \"It's important not to scare everyone who has a family history\" of Alzheimer's because this gene duo isn't behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\nHow do genetics affect Alzheimer's?\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one. About 2% of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\nResearch points to a cause for a subset of Alzheimer's\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's such as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than those with just one copy or the \"neutral\" APOE3 gene variety, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. By age 65, brain scans showed significant plaque buildup in nearly three-quarters of those double carriers - who also were more likely to have initial Alzheimer's symptoms around that age rather than in the 70s or 80s.\n\nFortea said the disease's underlying biology was remarkably similar to young inherited types.\n\nIt appears more like \"a familial form of Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging. \"It is not just a risk factor.\"\n\nImportantly, not everyone with two APOE4 genes develops Alzheimer's symptoms and researchers need to learn why, Sperling cautioned.\n\n\"It's not quite destiny,\" she said.\n\nHow the new findings may affect Alzheimer's research and treatment\n\nThe drug Leqembi works by clearing away some sticky amyloid but Sperling said it's not clear if carriers of two APOE4 genes benefit because they have such a high risk of a side effect from the drug - dangerous brain swelling and bleeding. One research question is whether they'd do better starting such drugs sooner than other people.\n\nMasliah said other research aims to develop gene therapy or drugs to specifically target APOE4. He said it's also crucial to understand APOE4's effects in diverse populations since it's been studied mostly in white people of European ancestry.\n\nAs for gene tests, for now they're typically used only to evaluate if someone's a candidate for Leqembi or for people enrolling in Alzheimer's research - especially studies of possible ways to prevent the disease. Sperling said the people most likely to carry two APOE4 genes had parents who both got Alzheimer's relatively early, in their 60s rather than 80s.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute on Aging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genealogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cerebral edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2023/10/27/PDTN/71341794007-ap-22333720825958.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1023,576,x0,y38&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

About 2% to 3% of the general population, or 15% of people with Alzheimer's, have two copies of the APOE4 variant.\n\n\"This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer's earlier than people without this gene,\" said professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer's researcher at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study.\n\nDr. Juan Fortea of the University of Barcelona and colleagues studied more than 3,000 donated brains from the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, as well as biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from three countries.\n\nThey found that by age 65, at least 95% of people with two copies of APOE4 - known as homozygotes - had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer's-related protein called beta amyloid in their spinal fluid, and 75% had positive brain scans for amyloid.\n\nNearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at age 65 than people who did not carry the risk variant.\n\nThe findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three main criteria for being a genetic disease: nearly everyone with these two variants have Alzheimer's biology; they develop symptoms at about the same rate; and clinical and biological changes occur in a predictable sequence, the researchers said.\n\nProfessor David Curtis of the UCL Genetics Institute, who was not involved in the research, remained unconvinced. \"I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some 'distinct genetic form' of Alzheimer's disease',\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer's disease,\" he said.\n\nTREATMENT IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe findings could have implications for the recently approved Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi from Eisai and Biogen, a drug that removes amyloid from the brain.\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant have much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. Because of this, some centers do not treat these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mass General Brigham who worked on the study, said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nThe findings suggest they should be treated at a younger age because \"we know they're very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly,\" she said.\n\nDr. Samuel Gandy, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mount Sinai in New York, said the findings stress the need to enroll APOE4 homozygotes into trials designed to prevent the disease before they develop symptoms. Sperling is conducting one such trial.\n\nHeather Snyder of the Alzheimer's Association said the findings, if correct, could have significant implications for how disease risk is assessed, how it is studied in clinical trials and how treatments are developed.\n\nThe new designation would be for Alzheimer's that develops later in life. Other genetic forms include Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's Disease, which is caused by mutations in three different genes, and Down syndrome.\n\nA key limitation of the study is that it involved mostly people of European ancestry. The team said more study is needed in people of African descent, a population in which APOE4 appears to convey a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n(Reporting by Julie SteenhuysenEditing by Bill Berkrot)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/011ca32/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2Fd0%2F5265b34e800974192e273f9dac37a1%2Ftag%3Areuters.com%2C2024%3Anewsml_LYNXMPEK450GG%3A22024-05-06T185103Z_2_LYNXMPEK450GG_RTROPTP_3_HEALTH-ALZHEIMERS-GENES.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

About 2% of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's such as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than those with just one copy or the \"neutral\" APOE3 gene variety, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine.

But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \"profound implications,\" said Dr. Juan Fortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older adults who develop Alzheimer's.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning those cases \"can be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\" Fortea said. Until now, genetic forms of Alzheimer's were thought to be only types that strike at much younger ages and account for less than 1% of all cases.\n\nScientists say the research makes it critical to develop treatments that target the APOE4 gene. Some doctors won't offer the only drug that has been shown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair because they're especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer's and \"this data for me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they become symptomatic.\"\n\nBut the news doesn't mean people should race for a gene test. \"It's important not to scare everyone who has a family history\" of Alzheimer's because this gene duo isn't behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one. About 2% of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's such as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than those with just one copy or the \"neutral\" APOE3 gene variety, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. By age 65, brain scans showed significant plaque buildup in nearly three-quarters of those double carriers - who also were more likely to have initial Alzheimer's symptoms around that age rather than in the 70s or 80s.\n\nFortea said the disease's underlying biology was remarkably similar to young inherited types.\n\nIt appears more like \"a familial form of Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging. \"It is not just a risk factor.\"\n\nImportantly, not everyone with two APOE4 genes develops Alzheimer's symptoms and researchers need to learn why, Sperling cautioned.\n\n\"It's not quite destiny,\" she said.\n\nThe drug Leqembi works by clearing away some sticky amyloid but Sperling said it's not clear if carriers of two APOE4 genes benefit because they have such a high risk of a side effect from the drug - dangerous brain swelling and bleeding. One research question is whether they'd do better starting such drugs sooner than other people.\n\nMasliah said other research aims to develop gene therapy or drugs to specifically target APOE4. He said it's also crucial to understand APOE4's effects in diverse populations since it's been studied mostly in white people of European ancestry.\n\nAs for gene tests, for now they're typically used only to evaluate if someone's a candidate for Leqembi or for people enrolling in Alzheimer's research - especially studies of possible ways to prevent the disease.

The reclassification could change Alzheimer's research, diagnosis and approaches to treatment, according to the researchers, whose study was published in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\n\"Through these data we are saying that perhaps this is a genetic form of this disease, not merely a risk factor indication,\" study co-author Sterling Johnson of the University of Wisconsin's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center told reporters in a briefing. Scientists have known for three decades that people with two copies of APOE4 gene variant have significantly higher risk of developing the disease than people with the most common version of the APOE gene, known as APOE3. About 2% to 3% of the general population, or 15% of people with Alzheimer's, have two copies of the APOE4 variant.\n\n\"This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer's earlier than people without this gene,\" said professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer's researcher at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study. Dr. Juan Fortea of the University of Barcelona and colleagues studied more than 3,000 donated brains from the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, as well as biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from three countries.\n\nThey found that by age 65, at least 95% of people with two copies of APOE4 - known as homozygotes - had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer's-related protein called beta amyloid in their spinal fluid, and 75% had positive brain scans for amyloid. Nearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at age 65 than people who did not carry the risk variant.\n\nThe findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three main criteria for being a genetic disease: nearly everyone with these two variants have Alzheimer's biology; they develop symptoms at about the same rate; and clinical and biological changes occur in a predictable sequence, the researchers said. Professor David Curtis of the UCL Genetics Institute, who was not involved in the research, remained unconvinced. \"I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some 'distinct genetic form' of Alzheimer's disease',\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer's disease,\" he said. TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS\n\nThe findings could have implications for the recently approved Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi from Eisai and Biogen, a drug that removes amyloid from the brain. In clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant have much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. Because of this, some centers do not treat these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mass General Brigham who worked on the study, said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nThe findings suggest they should be treated at a younger age because \"we know they're very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly,\" she said. Dr. Samuel Gandy, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mount Sinai in New York, said the findings stress the need to enroll APOE4 homozygotes into trials designed to prevent the disease before they develop symptoms. Sperling is conducting one such trial.\n\nHeather Snyder of the Alzheimer's Association said the findings, if correct, could have significant implications for how disease risk is assessed, how it is studied in clinical trials and how treatments are developed. The new designation would be for Alzheimer's that develops later in life. Other genetic forms include Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's Disease, which is caused by mutations in three different genes, and Down syndrome.\n\nA key limitation of the study is that it involved mostly people of European ancestry. The team said more study is needed in people of African descent, a population in which APOE4 appears to convey a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "label": "dmoz/Health/Medicine/Research", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_23_57_7812851.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labelled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one.\n\nFortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in US and European Alzheimer's studies.\n\nThey examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's

In very rare cases, a fault (mutation) in one of three genes is sufficient to cause Alzheimer's disease. This form of the disease runs in families - and so is called familial Alzheimer's disease - and usually causes young-onset dementia.\n\n\"We also know that inheriting certain genes can increase an individual's risk of developing Alzheimer's. The best known of these is a gene called APOE. There are three different versions of this gene, APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4. Each of us carries two copies of APOE, one inherited from each parent - and this means there are different combinations people can carry. APOE2 decreases and APOE4 increases risk for Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"About 1 in 50 people carry two copies of APOE4, and we have known for some time that these individuals have substantially increased risk. In this large well-conducted study, researchers showed that people who inherited two copies of APOE4 almost all developed Alzheimer changes in the brain by their mid 60's. These individuals were more likely to develop dementia and tended to do so at a younger age than those with different APOE combinations.\n\n\"At the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future. At Alzheimer's Research UK, we are funding several research projects to try and understand why having the APOE4 gene increases the risk of Alzheimer's, and equally why some people with APOE4 do not develop dementia. We hope this work will lead to the development of new treatments for people both with and without APOE4, and so bring us closer to a cure.\"\n\nDr Richard Oakley, Alzheimer's Society's Associate Director of Research and Innovation, said:\n\n\"There are 900,000 people living with dementia in the UK. Understanding the causes of the disease in greater detail is vital and can unlock new ways of diagnosing, treating and caring for people affected by Alzheimer's disease in the future. Further understanding the role of different gene mutations is one way in which researchers can understand what might be causing people to develop the disease.\n\n\"This study has shown us that this particular gene might play an important role in Alzheimer's disease development, suggesting its presence is not only a risk factor, but could also indicate a new form of Alzheimer's disease. The insights from the study suggest that in the future it could be important to take into account a person's genetics when planning how to reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, or when considering their treatment if they already have the disease.\n\n\"Dementia is the UK's biggest killer and this new insight into the role of genes shows there is still a lot to learn about this devastating disease and reinforces how crucial research will be in one day beating dementia. Alzheimer's Society funds research into dementia treatments, diagnosis, cure, innovation.\"\n\nProf Paul Matthews, Director of The Rosalind Franklin Institute and Group Leader, UK Dementia Research Institute Centre at Imperial College, said:\n\n\"This report provides new, strong data showing that inheritance of two copies of the APOE4 gene is a cause of Alzheimer's disease. The results force a change in thinking of APOE4 simply as a risk factor for Alzheimer's. As 2 of 100 Northern Europeans carry two copies of the gene, the authors highlight that this discovery makes APOE4 Alzheimer's Disease one of the most common of all Mendelian genetic disorders.\n\n\"One implication of this work is that testing for APOE4 gene homozygosity should be assessed for use clinically when late middle-aged people present to their doctors with symptoms of dementia. Because APOE4 homozygotes are common in the population, have predictable ages of onset and rates of progression of disease and, as demonstrated in the paper, show easy to measure biomarker changes as their disease evolves, they also constitute an attractive population for clinical trials of new treatments for Alzheimer's disease.\"\n\nProf Tara Spires-Jones, President of the British Neuroscience Association and Group Leader at the UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said:\n\n\"This study by Dr Fortea and colleagues in Barcelona looked at data from over 10,000 individuals and observed that almost everyone in the study who inherited two copies of the APOE4 gene had Alzheimer's disease as they aged. This is a strong study confirming an important link between APOE4 and Alzheimer's; however it is not at all a surprise. The increased risk of Alzheimer's disease with inheriting the APOE4 gene has been known for over 30 years. This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with 2 copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's if they live long enough and that they will develop Alzheimer's earlier than people without this gene. Moving forward, this study and others highlight the importance of more fundamental research into understanding how genes change the susceptibility of our brains to Alzheimer's disease as we age.\"\n\nProf David Curtis, Honorary Professor, UCL Genetics Institute, UCL, said:\n\n\"I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some \"distinct genetic form\" of Alzheimer's disease. It has been known for decades that APOE4 is a strong risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, that people carrying two copies are at high risk and that people carrying two copies are at substantially higher risk than those carrying one. No matter how many alleles of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that any effective treatment and prevention strategies, which have yet to be developed, would have broad applicability.\"\n\nProf Paul Matthews: Consultancies with Sudo Biosciences, Nimbus, Redburn\n\nProf Tara Spires-Jones: I have no direct conflicts with this study but have co-authored papers with one of the authors in the past.\n\nProf David Curtis: No conflicts\n\nFor all other experts, no reply to out request for DOIs was received.", "source": {"uri": "sciencemediacentre.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science Media Centre"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Research_UK", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Research UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rosalind Franklin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Imperial College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basic research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mendelian inheritance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 77}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The vast majority of Alzheimer's cases occur after age 65. But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \"profound implications,\" said Dr. Juan Fortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older adults who develop Alzheimer's.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning those cases \"can be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\" Fortea said.

Some doctors won't offer the only drug that has been shown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair because they're especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer's and \"this data for me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they become symptomatic.\"\n\nBut the news doesn't mean people should race for a gene test. \"It's important not to scare everyone who has a family history\" of Alzheimer's because this gene duo isn't behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\nHOW DO GENETICS AFFECT ALZHEIMER'S?\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one. About 2% of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\nRESEARCH POINTS TO A CAUSE FOR A SUBSET OF ALZHEIMER'S\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's such as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than those with just one copy or the \"neutral\" APOE3 gene variety, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. By age 65, brain scans showed significant plaque buildup in nearly three-quarters of those double carriers - who also were more likely to have initial Alzheimer's symptoms around that age rather than in the 70s or 80s.\n\nFortea said the disease's underlying biology was remarkably similar to young inherited types.\n\nIt appears more like \"a familial form of Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging. \"It is not just a risk factor.\"\n\nImportantly, not everyone with two APOE4 genes develops Alzheimer's symptoms and researchers need to learn why, Sperling cautioned.\n\n\"It's not quite destiny,\" she said.\n\nHOW THE NEW FINDINGS MAY AFFECT ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH AND TREATMENT\n\nThe drug Leqembi works by clearing away some sticky amyloid but Sperling said it's not clear if carriers of two APOE4 genes benefit because they have such a high risk of a side effect from the drug - dangerous brain swelling and bleeding. One research question is whether they'd do better starting such drugs sooner than other people.\n\nMasliah said other research aims to develop gene therapy or drugs to specifically target APOE4. He said it's also crucial to understand APOE4's effects in diverse populations since it's been studied mostly in white people of European ancestry.\n\nAs for gene tests, for now they're typically used only to evaluate if someone's a candidate for Leqembi or for people enrolling in Alzheimer's research - especially studies of possible ways to prevent the disease. Sperling said the people most likely to carry two APOE4 genes had parents who both got Alzheimer's relatively early, in their 60s rather than 80s.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Alzheimer's disease", "body": "Scientists say they have identified a new genetic form of Alzheimer's disease that underscores the urgent need for developing specialised treatment and prevention strategies.\n\nResearchers in the US said almost all of the people who carry two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, known as APOE4 homozygotes, are likely to develop signs of the neurological condition.\n\nThey said this gene is already associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nBut scientists now believe 95% people who are over 65 and carry two copies of APOE4 show early signs of the disease, making it a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's.\n\nThese people also develop the condition earlier than those with other variants of the APOE gene, they added.\n\nThe findings, published in the journal Nature Medicine, are based on clinical data from more than 10,000 people, as well as pathological data from more than 3,000 brain donors.\n\nDr Juan Fortea, director of the research area on neurological diseases, neuroscience, and mental health at the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barceclona, Spain, said: \"These data represent a reconceptualisation of the disease or what it means to be homozygous for the APOE4 gene.\n\n\"This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology.\"\n\nHe said the findings are important because APOE4 homozygotes represent between 2% and 3% of the general population.\n\nThis warrants the development of specialised research strategies, treatment approaches and clinical trials for these people, according to the researchers.\n\nDr Reisa Sperling, professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School, and director of the Centre for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, in the US, added: \"This research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very likely to progress to impairment quickly.\n\n\"So we have to think about how we can treat APOE4 carriers.\n\n\"These individuals are desperate - they have seen it (the disease) in both of their parents.\"\n\nMutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, are known to cause a rare form of Alzheimer's known as ADAD (early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease).\n\nThis form of the disease runs in families.\n\nAPOE is one of many other genes associated with Alzheimer's and comes in three different variations: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4.\n\nEveryone carries two copies of APOE, one inherited from each parent.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that having at least one APOE4 gene variant, which about 25% of people in the UK are thought to carry, almost triples the risk of getting the disease, while having two copies increases the risk by up to twelve-fold.\n\nIn the current research, the team found a majority of people with two copies of APOE4 showed signs of the disease by the age of 55, compared with those with another gene variant, such as APOE3.\n\nAnd by the age of 65, almost all (95%) of them had abnormal levels of a protein known as amyloid in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - a key sign of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nScans showed that 75% of over-65 APOE4 homozygotes had abnormal build-up of amyloid protein in the brain, which is seven to 10 years earlier than symptom development for other APOE variants.\n\nCommenting on the study, Professor Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, added: \"In this large well-conducted study, researchers showed that people who inherited two copies of APOE4 almost all developed Alzheimer's changes in the brain by their mid 60s.\n\n\"These individuals were more likely to develop dementia and tended to do so at a younger age than those with different APOE combinations.\n\n\"At the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future.\"\n\nHe said that Alzheimer's UK is funding research projects to try to understand why having the APOE4 gene increases the risk of disease.\n\nDr Richard Oakley, Alzheimer's Society's associate director of research and innovation, added: \"This study has shown us that this particular gene might play an important role in Alzheimer's disease development, suggesting its presence is not only a risk factor, but could also indicate a new form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"The insights from the study suggest that in the future it could be important to take into account a person's genetics when planning how to reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, or when considering their treatment if they already have the disease.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com",

The vast majority of Alzheimer's cases occur after age 65. But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \"profound implications,\" said Dr. Juan Fortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older adults who develop Alzheimer's.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning those cases \"can be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\" Fortea said. Until now, genetic forms of Alzheimer's were thought to be only types that strike at much younger ages and account for less than 1% of all cases.\n\nScientists say the research makes it critical to develop treatments that target the APOE4 gene. Some doctors won't offer the only drug that has been shown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair because they're especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer's and \"this data for me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they become symptomatic.\"\n\nBut the news doesn't mean people should race for a gene test. \"It's important not to scare everyone who has a family history\" of Alzheimer's because this gene duo isn't behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHOW DO GENETICS AFFECT ALZHEIMER'S?\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one. About 2% of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\nRESEARCH POINTS TO A CAUSE FOR A SUBSET OF ALZHEIMER'S\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's such as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than those with just one copy or the \"neutral\" APOE3 gene variety, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. By age 65, brain scans showed significant plaque buildup in nearly three-quarters of those double carriers - who also were more likely to have initial Alzheimer's symptoms around that age rather than in the 70s or 80s.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFortea said the disease's underlying biology was remarkably similar to young inherited types.\n\nIt appears more like \"a familial form of Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging. \"It is not just a risk factor.\"\n\nImportantly, not everyone with two APOE4 genes develops Alzheimer's symptoms and researchers need to learn why, Sperling cautioned.\n\n\"It's not quite destiny,\" she said.\n\nHOW THE NEW FINDINGS MAY AFFECT ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH AND TREATMENT\n\nThe drug Leqembi works by clearing away some sticky amyloid but Sperling said it's not clear if carriers of two APOE4 genes benefit because they have such a high risk of a side effect from the drug - dangerous brain swelling and bleeding. One research question is whether they'd do better starting such drugs sooner than other people.\n\nMasliah said other research aims to develop gene therapy or drugs to specifically target APOE4. He said it's also crucial to understand APOE4's effects in diverse populations since it's been studied mostly in white people of European ancestry.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs for gene tests, for now they're typically used only to evaluate if someone's a candidate for Leqembi or for people enrolling in Alzheimer's research - especially studies of possible ways to prevent the disease.

These people also develop the condition earlier than those with other variants of the APOE gene, according to the scientists.\n\nTheir findings, published in the journal Nature Medicine, are based on clinical data from more than 10,000 people, as well as pathological data from more than 3,000 brain donors.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that having at least one APOE4 gene variant, known as APOE4 homozygotes, which about 25 per cent of people in the UK are thought to carry, almost triples the risk of getting the disease, while having two copies increases the risk by up to twelve-fold.\n\nIn the latest research, the team found a majority of people with two copies of APOE4 showed signs of the disease by the age of 55.\n\nAnd by the age of 65, almost all (95 per cent) of them had abnormal levels of a protein known as amyloid in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - a key sign of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nScans showed that 75 per cent of over-65 APOE4 homozygotes had abnormal build-up of amyloid protein in the brain, which is seven to 10 years earlier than symptom development for other APOE variants.\n\nLead author Dr Juan Fortea, director of the research area on neurological diseases, neuroscience, and mental health at the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain, said: \"This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

The vast majority of Alzheimer's cases occur after age 65. But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \"profound implications,\" said Dr. Juan Fortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older adults who develop Alzheimer's.\n\nAn estimated 15% of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning those cases \"can be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\" Fortea said. Until now, genetic forms of Alzheimer's were thought to be only types that strike at much younger ages and account for less than 1% of all cases.\n\nScientists say the research makes it critical to develop treatments that target the APOE4 gene. Some doctors won't offer the only drug that has been shown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair because they're especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer's and \"this data for me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they become symptomatic.\"\n\nBut the news doesn't mean people should race for a gene test. \"It's important not to scare everyone who has a family history\" of Alzheimer's because this gene duo isn't behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\nHOW DO GENETICS AFFECT ALZHEIMER'S?\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one. About 2% of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\nRESEARCH POINTS TO A CAUSE FOR A SUBSET OF ALZHEIMER'S\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies. They examined symptoms and early hallmarks of Alzheimer's such as sticky amyloid in the brain.\n\nPeople with two APOE4 copies were accumulating more amyloid at age 55 than those with just one copy or the \"neutral\" APOE3 gene variety, they reported in the journal Nature Medicine. By age 65, brain scans showed significant plaque buildup in nearly three-quarters of those double carriers - who also were more likely to have initial Alzheimer's symptoms around that age rather than in the 70s or 80s.\n\nFortea said the disease's underlying biology was remarkably similar to young inherited types.\n\nIt appears more like \"a familial form of Alzheimer's,\" said Dr. Eliezer Masliah of the National Institute on Aging. \"It is not just a risk factor.\"\n\nImportantly, not everyone with two APOE4 genes develops Alzheimer's symptoms and researchers need to learn why, Sperling cautioned.\n\n\"It's not quite destiny,\" she said.\n\nHOW THE NEW FINDINGS MAY AFFECT ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH AND TREATMENT\n\nThe drug Leqembi works by clearing away some sticky amyloid but Sperling said it's not clear if carriers of two APOE4 genes benefit because they have such a high risk of a side effect from the drug - dangerous brain swelling and bleeding. One research question is whether they'd do better starting such drugs sooner than other people.\n\nMasliah said other research aims to develop gene therapy or drugs to specifically target APOE4. He said it's also crucial to understand APOE4's effects in diverse populations since it's been studied mostly in white people of European ancestry.\n\nAs for gene tests, for now they're typically used only to evaluate if someone's a candidate for Leqembi or for people enrolling in Alzheimer's research - especially studies of possible ways to prevent the disease. Sperling said the people most likely to carry two APOE4 genes had parents who both got Alzheimer's relatively early, in their 60s rather than 80s.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute on Aging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_history_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Family history (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cerebral edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZDY3OTBhZmEtMTFiYS00:ODNhM2I3/landscape/1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Most cases are thought to be sporadic, which develop later in life. Familial forms, caused by mutations in any of three genes, tend to strike earlier and are known to be rare, accounting for about 2% of all Alzheimer's diagnoses, or about 1 in 50 cases.\n\nUnder the new paradigm, 1 in 6 cases of Alzheimer's would be considered to be inherited, or familial.\n\nThis shifting appreciation of inherited risk, researchers say, is due to a better understanding of the role of a fourth gene that carries the blueprints to make a lipid-carrying protein called apolipoprotein E, known as APOE. APOE ferries cholesterol throughout the body and brain and is thought to play a role in depositing or sweeping away sticky beta amyloid plaques, which are one hallmark of Alzheimer's.\n\nThere are three types of the APOE gene a person can carry. One known as APOE2 is thought to be protective against the development of Alzheimer's disease. APOE3 is thought to confer a neutral risk of the disease. APOE4, on the other hand, is bad news. It has long been recognized that people with at least one copy of the APOE4 gene have an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, while people with two copies had a higher risk still.\n\nNow, researchers say APOE4 shouldn't just be recognized as a risk factor -- it should be viewed as an inherited form of the disease, virtually assuring that a person who has two copies will get the biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease in their brains.\n\nIn the new study, researchers from Spain and the United States compared people in clinical studies with two copies of the APOE4 gene to people with other forms of the APOE gene.\n\nThey also compared people with two copies of APOE4 to people with other inherited forms of the disease -- early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer's disease (DSAD). The study included data from nearly 3,300 brains that are stored at the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and data from another 10,000 people who were participants in five different clinical trials.\n\nNot only were people with two copies of the APOE4 gene much more likely to develop the biological changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease, similar to people with the other genetic forms of the disease, they were almost assured the diagnosis: Nearly 95% of the people in the studies with two copies of the APOE4 gene had the biology of Alzheimer's disease by the time they were 82 years old.\n\nThe study authors say that while APOE4 reliably causes the biological changes associated with the disease -- the creation of beta amyloid plaques in the brain -- having one or two copies of this gene doesn't always lead to cognitive decline. Rarely, people can have APOE4 and have a lot of beta amyloid in their brain, but not have symptoms, perhaps because of other genetic or environmental factors that protect their brains at the same time. In the large dataset of nearly 3,300 brains kept by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, for example, 273 individuals had two copies of the APOE4 gene, and 240, or 88%, had dementia.\n\nWhen people with two copies of APOE4 do have symptoms, they tend to get them earlier than others. On average, they developed Alzheimer's about 10 years earlier -- around age 65 -- compared with people with other forms of the APOE gene. Researchers also found that the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in their brains followed almost the same trajectory as has been noted in people with other inherited forms of the disease. Their disease was more severe earlier in life.\n\nIn all the inherited forms of the disease, \"there are striking, striking similarities in the way the disease progresses and the symptoms it gets,\" said lead study author Dr. Juan Fortea, a neurologist and director of the Memory Unit of the Neurology Department at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, in a news briefing.\n\nFortea and his co-authors argue that for these reasons, having two copies of the APOE4 gene should be considered a genetic form of the disease, and not merely a risk for it.\n\nDr. Charles Bernick, who is associate medical director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, said the study was important because it really showed how powerful having two copies of the APOE4 gene was.\n\n\"It really drives a disease process,\" said Bernick, who was not involved in the study.\n\nThe strength of APOE4's role in the development of Alzheimer's wasn't recognized earlier, the researchers think, because APOE4 also plays an important role in heart health, and they think many people with two copies of the gene probably died from cardiovascular causes before they developed Alzheimer's. Previous studies had estimated that 30-35% of people with two copies of the APOE4 gene would develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia.\n\nResearchers say they also found a gene-dose effect. While having two copies of APOE4 assured that a person would see beta amyloid and tau build up in their brains, having just one copy of the gene also increased a person's risk -- but not as much as having two copies of that gene.\n\nThat would mean that the APOE4 gene is semi-dominant, Fortea said. Other diseases where genes show semi-dominance include sickle cell anemia and hypercholesterolemia. In sickle cell, for example, two copies of the gene cause sickle cell disease, but one copy causes sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait don't usually have symptoms, but they may be more likely to experience heat stroke or muscle breakdown during strenuous exercise, and they can experience pain crises under certain conditions.\n\nClassifying APOE4 as an inherited form of the disease has some big implications. First, it would mean that a far greater proportion of Alzheimer's cases are caused by genes than has been previously understood.\n\nBefore APOE4, the only gene changes recognized to cause Alzheimer's were associated with early-onset forms of the disease and with Down's syndrome. They accounted for about 2% of Alzheimer's cases -- about 1 in 50.\n\nPeople with two copies of the APOE4 gene make up about 15% of people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, or 1 in 7 cases of the disease.\n\nAbout 2% of the general population carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which would make it one of the most prevalent inherited diseases.\n\nIt is also likely to change how people who carry the APOE4 gene are diagnosed and treated.\n\nThere are tests available to determine a person's APOE4 status, but they're not recommended as a routine part of diagnosis. That may need to change, the study authors said.\n\n\"The consensus and the guidelines now do not recommend testing for APOE4 and that was because the consensus was that it did not help for the diagnosis,\" Fortea said.\n\nAPOE testing is recommended for patients who are being evaluated to take new amyloid-clearing medications, such as lecanemab.\n\nBecause Alzheimer's patients with two copies of the APOE4 gene are at greater risk for serious side effects like brain swelling from new amyloid-clearing medications, some treatment centers have decided not to offer them the drugs, said study author Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the center for Alzheimer's Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"I find this very problematic given these data,\" she said, noting that it would be important to do research to see if it might be possible to find safer dosing or safer treatments for this patient group.\n\n\"For me, this just means we need to treat them earlier,\" Sperling said, \"and this research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age, and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly.\"\n\nDr. Sterling Johnson, who leads the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention at the University of Wisconsin, said it would be very important for clinical trials to start to take participants' APOE4 status into account.\n\n\"We may need to start treating these as a separate group in our research papers so that we can really understand the relationship between amyloid and tau and symptoms\" in people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, in a way that we kind of have not been able to before, said Johnson, who is also a study author, in the news briefing.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

It's often identified by two key brain changes: the buildup of beta-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.\n\nHowever, a recent development at the University of California San Diego might help in diagnosing the disease earlier than ever before.\n\nResearchers at UC San Diego have found that high levels of an enzyme called PHGDH in the blood could serve as an early indicator of Alzheimer's disease. This enzyme is critical in producing serine, an amino acid necessary for brain health and protein synthesis.\n\nTypically, increased levels of PHGDH might suggest an escalated production of serine in the brain, a pattern noticed in Alzheimer's patients.\n\nThe study involved examining genetic data from the brains of deceased individuals who had participated in research while alive, encompassing Alzheimer's patients, asymptomatic individuals, and healthy controls.\n\nThe researchers noticed consistently higher PHGDH levels in both Alzheimer's patients and those who showed no symptoms yet had the disease, compared to healthy individuals.\n\nThis pattern held true across four different research groups and even mirrored findings in Alzheimer's disease models in mice.\n\nA fascinating aspect of the research was the relationship between cognitive performance and PHGDH levels. Individuals with poorer cognitive scores tended to have higher PHGDH expression, indicating the enzyme's potential as a predictive biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.\n\nInterestingly, the findings pose questions about the use of serine supplements, which are sometimes considered for Alzheimer's prevention or treatment.\n\nWith evidence of increased serine production already in Alzheimer's patients, additional serine might not be beneficial and could potentially be counterproductive.\n\nThe discovery of PHGDH as a potential biomarker was not entirely new, as previous studies hinted at its relevance.\n\nHowever, this research solidifies its role, suggesting that measuring PHGDH levels in the blood could be a valuable tool for early diagnosis and possibly for monitoring the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nGiven the absence of a cure, preventing Alzheimer's is crucial. Strategies such as regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet (especially one resembling the Mediterranean diet), keeping mentally active, and managing chronic health conditions can all contribute to lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nThis study, led by Sheng Zhong and his team and published in Cell Metabolism, not only advances our understanding of Alzheimer's but also emphasizes the importance of cautious and informed approaches to treatments like dietary supplements.\n\nAs research continues, the role of enzymes like PHGDH and amino acids like serine in Alzheimer's disease will become clearer, potentially leading to more effective interventions and preventative measures.\n\nIf you care about Alzheimer's, please read studies about Vitamin D deficiency linked to Alzheimer's, vascular dementia, and Oral cannabis extract may help reduce Alzheimer's symptoms.\n\nFor more information about brain health, please see recent studies about Vitamin B9 deficiency linked to higher dementia risk, and results showing flavonoid-rich foods could improve survival in Parkinson's disease.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoglycerate_dehydrogenase", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Serine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of California, San Diego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enzyme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_biosynthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein biosynthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibrillary_tangle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurofibrillary tangle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amino acid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asymptomatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_D_deficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vitamin D deficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vascular dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_diet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean diet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parkinson's disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Can-brain-supplements-increase-Alzheimer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Would you live your life differently?\n\nA study published on Monday brings us closer to a future in which patients have that option. It also provides new clues about the causes and possible treatments of an ailment suffered by tens of millions of people around the world, for which there is no cure and for which there are no clear causes.\n\nA team led by neurologist Juan Fortea, from the Sant Pau Hospital in Barcelona, has analyzed brain samples from more than 3,000 deceased people and brain scans and other diagnostic tests from another 10,000 patients to analyze the effect of carrying two copies of the apolipoprotein 4 gene, or APOE4, in the genome. It was known that this gene carries the highest genetic risk of suffering Alzheimer's, but until now, it was not clear by just how much.\n\nThe study has identified 500 patients who carry this variant and has shown that 95% have early biological markers related to Alzheimer's, such as the build up of amyloid protein in the brain, which is related to the disease. The study also indicates that the age at which these people will begin to suffer symptoms can be reliably predicted: approximately 65 years, about 10 years earlier than those who carry the other less dangerous APOE gene variants: 3 or 2.\n\nThe researchers propose a different way of understanding the disease. According to the study, APOE4 should not only be considered a risk factor for Alzheimer's, as is the case now, but rather the double copy of APOE4 should be understood as a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's. This variant of the disease would be added to the two known types of genetic Alzheimer's: early Alzheimer's, caused by very rare mutations, which has been studied for decades in families from Antioquia, Colombia, and Alzheimer's associated with Down syndrome -- nine out of 10 patients ends up developing dementia.\n\nThis new form of genetic Alzheimer's would be by far the most common. \"Between 2% and 3% of the entire Caucasian population carries a double copy of the APOE4 gene, which represents millions of people around the world,\" explains Fortea in a telephone interview. \"In addition, this variant accounts for 15% of all Alzheimer's cases. Normally we say that the causes of this disease are not known, but with this study we can say that we can explain those 15% of cases,\" he adds.\n\nThe study, published in Nature Medicine, focused on biological markers associated with the disease, such as amyloid or tau, another harmful protein that builds up in the brain. The next step, Fortea explains, will be to gather data from thousands of patients to determine what risk people with this variant have of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's, a project that is already underway. If the results corroborate that it is a genetic disease that nearly 100% of people with the variant are predisposed to suffering, current medical guidelines on diagnosis and treatment may change, including the use of genetic tests and the communication of the results to patients.\n\n\"I may have dozens of patients affected by this variant, but I should not tell them because clinical practice does not recommend it,\" says the doctor. In part, it is because until lecanemab and donanemab, there was no drug capable of modifying the course of the disease.\n\nThese two new drugs are the first in decades to provide some benefit against this disease, although their effects are so modest that many patients do not perceive improvement. The first biological markers emerge about 20 years before the onset of symptoms, and once memory loss begins, its progression is unstoppable, which is why it has been so difficult to develop effective treatments. The hope is that these two drugs or others like them can help in earlier stages. Several clinical trials are studying this possibility in patients who have not yet been diagnosed.\n\nThe work, says Fortea, also raises a future debate about whether or not patients should take a genetic test to find out if they carry the double APOE4. \"There is no good or bad decision. It all depends on how you manage the anxiety of knowing that you have, for example, an 80% chance of suffering from Alzheimer's. The other day, I was talking to a colleague who said he would never do it; I think I will,\" says Fortea.\n\nPascual S\u00e1nchez-Juan, scientific director of the Spanish neurological foundation CIEN, says the study is important because \"it helps put this group of people in the spotlight.\" He continues: \"We have known for 30 years that APOE4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's, but we put all patients together in the same group if they had one or two copies of the gene, which means that we were not perceiving the differences.\"\n\nIn Europe, APOE4 has been found to be more common in northern countries than in Mediterranean countries. One of the next steps will be to study more diverse populations, as the current data come almost exclusively from white people in the West. It is possible that the neurological effects of this variant are milder in populations from other regions, particularly Africa, where there appears to be protection from the effects of this variant.\n\nAlthough the causes of Alzheimer's disease are unclear, the two main suspects are two harmful proteins, amyloid beta and tau. This study provides important data to improve the understanding of the effect of these two molecules and the treatments against them.\n\n\"In the current study,\" notes neurologist David P\u00e9rez, professor of medicine at the Complutense University of Madrid, not all people with two copies of the APOE4 gene \"develop dementia or clinical Alzheimer's disease, although almost all accumulate brain amyloid at an early age. This early accumulation of amyloid was associated with a much higher risk of developing clinical symptoms and suggests a more direct connection of APOE4 with the pathological mechanisms of the disease, although clarity is still lacking in this regard.\"\n\n\"An interesting point,\" he continues, \"is that clinical trials with anti-amyloid antibodies that have demonstrated efficacy, such as lecanemab and donanemab, show that in APOE4 patients the risk of adverse effects is considerably much higher. This has led to reservations among many neurologists about their use in this group. In addition, analysis of efficacy in subgroups of APOE4 homozygotes [with two copies of this gene] has not shown greater effectiveness, and the results are still inconclusive as to whether these therapies are really effective in this specific subgroup. All this leads us to a great paradox; APOE4 homozygotes have an almost universal risk of accumulating brain amyloid after the age of 65 and developing earlier and more aggressive forms of Alzheimer's, but anti-amyloid therapies do not seem to be more effective in this group and, moreover, are clearly more risky.\"\n\nCarlos Dotti, a researcher at the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Center in Madrid, believes that these observations \"reinforce the concept that this disease, except in certain very specific cases, can be initiated by defects occurring outside the brain. It has long been suggested that cardiovascular and metabolic deficits play a significant role in its development, such as hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, arrhythmias. This work serves to confirm that a specific metabolic and cardiovascular condition, such as what occurs when one inherits both APOE4 alleles, is a definitive cause of disease, not simply a risk factor.\"\n\nFrancesc Guix, a bioengineering specialist at the Ram\u00f3n Llull University in Spain, explains further. \"The primary defect of being a carrier of the two E4 alleles is elevated levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreased levels of HDL cholesterol. Any clinician knows that these alterations will lead to cardiovascular problems, which, among other consequences, will affect cerebral oxygen flow. In addition, vascular alterations lead to an increase in inflammatory processes that will damage the brain. On the other hand, the two APOE4 alleles can also contribute to the development of Alzheimer's due to the actions that this protein plays at the level of the brain, both in relation to cholesterol transport between the different cell populations in the aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide and its elimination from the brain,\" he concludes.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL PA\u00cdS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nuno_dominguez@english.elpais.com", "name": "Nu\u00f1o Dom\u00ednguez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tau protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Down syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Probability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Colombia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complutense_University_of_Madrid", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Complutense University of Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/HVAAE5VNJNAOZF67N7WKN5XT5A.jpg?auth=5517a8140290f855d398a8e220d879718342a2a00d67ed971c1e2563b70a296a&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

About 2% to 3% of the general population, or about 15% of people with Alzheimer's, have two copies of the APOE4 variant. \"This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer's earlier than people without this gene,\" said professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer's researcher at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study.\n\nDr. Juan Fortea of the University of Barcelona and colleagues studied more than 3,000 donated brains from the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, as well as biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from five datasets in three countries. They found that by the age of 65, at least 95% of people with two copies of APOE4 - known as homozygotes - had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer's-related protein called beta amyloid in their spinal fluid, and 75% had positive brain scans for amyloid.\n\nNearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at age 65 than people who did not carry the risk variant. The findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three main criteria for being a genetic disease: nearly everyone with these two gene variants have Alzheimer's biology; they develop symptoms at about the same rate; and clinical and biological changes occur in a predictable sequence, the researchers said.\n\nProfessor David Curtis of the UCL Genetics Institute, who was not involved in the research, remained unconvinced. \"I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some 'distinct genetic form' of Alzheimer's disease',\" he said in a statement. \"No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer's disease,\" he said.\n\nThe findings could have implications for the recently approved Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi from Eisai and Biogen, a drug that removes amyloid from the brain. In clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant have much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. Because of this, some centers do not treat these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mass General Brigham who worked on the study, said in a briefing with reporters.\n\n\"This research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early at a younger age and at an early stage of pathology because we know they're very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly,\" she said. Spires-Jones said the work highlights the need for more research on how genes affect Alzheimer's disease as people age. Other genetic forms of Alzheimer's include Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's Disease, which is caused by mutations in two different genes, and Down syndrome.\n\nMost of the study population involved people of European ancestry, and the team noted that more work needs to be done in people of African descent, a population in which APOE4 appears to convey a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nature Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin\u2013Madison", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Edinburgh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Barcelona", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biogen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Down syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_General_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts General Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_23_10_1033124.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

homozygotes represent between 2% and 3% of the general population.\n\nThis warrants the development of specialised research strategies, treatment approaches and clinical trials for these people, according to the researchers.\n\nDr Reisa Sperling, professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School, and director of the Centre for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, in the US, added: \"This research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very

parents.\"\n\nThis form of the disease runs in families.\n\nAPOE is one of many other genes associated with Alzheimer's and comes in three different variations: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4.\n\nEveryone carries two copies of APOE, one inherited from each parent.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that having at least one APOE4 gene variant, which about 25% of people in the UK are thought to carry, almost triples the risk of getting the disease, while having two copies increases the risk by up to twelve-fold.\n\nIn the current research, the team found a majority of people with two copies of APOE4 showed signs of the disease by the age of 55, compared with those with another gene variant, such as APOE3.\n\nAnd by the age of 65, almost all (95%) of them had abnormal levels of a protein known as amyloid in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - a key sign of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nCommenting on the study, Professor Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, added: \"In this large well-conducted study, researchers showed that people who inherited two copies of APOE4 almost all developed Alzheimer's changes in the brain by their mid 60s.\n\n\"These individuals were more likely to develop dementia and tended to do so at a younger age than those with different APOE combinations.\n\n\"At the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future.\"\n\nHe said that Alzheimer's UK is funding research projects to try to understand why having the APOE4 gene increases the risk of disease.\n\nDr Richard Oakley, Alzheimer's Society's associate director of research and innovation, added: \"This study has shown us that this particular gene might play an important role in Alzheimer's disease development, suggesting its presence is not only a risk factor, but could also indicate a new form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"The insights from the study suggest that in the future it could be important to take into account a person's genetics when planning how to reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, or when considering their treatment if they already have the disease.\"", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "press_association@jerseyeveningpost.com",

Most cases are thought to be sporadic, which develop later in life. Familial forms, caused by mutations in any of three genes, tend to strike earlier and are known to be rare, accounting for about 2% of all Alzheimer's diagnoses, or about 1 in 50 cases.\n\nUnder the new paradigm, 1 in 6 cases of Alzheimer's would be considered to be inherited, or familial.\n\nThis shifting appreciation of inherited risk, researchers say, is due to a better understanding of the role of a fourth gene that carries the blueprints to make a lipid-carrying protein called apolipoprotein E, known as APOE. APOE ferries cholesterol throughout the body and brain and is thought to play a role in depositing or sweeping away sticky beta amyloid plaques, which are one hallmark of Alzheimer's.\n\nThere are three types of the APOE gene a person can carry. One known as APOE2 is thought to be protective against the development of Alzheimer's disease. APOE3 is thought to confer a neutral risk of the disease. APOE4, on the other hand, is bad news. It has long been recognized that people with at least one copy of the APOE4 gene have an elevated risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, while people with two copies had a higher risk still.\n\nNow, researchers say APOE4 shouldn't just be recognized as a risk factor -- it should be viewed as an inherited form of the disease, virtually assuring that a person who has two copies will get the biological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease in their brains.\n\nTeasing out gene's role in Alzheimer's\n\nIn the new study, researchers from Spain and the United States compared people in clinical studies with two copies of the APOE4 gene to people with other forms of the APOE gene.\n\nThey also compared people with two copies of APOE4 to people with other inherited forms of the disease -- early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease (ADAD) and Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer's disease (DSAD). The study included data from nearly 3,300 brains that are stored at the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and data from another 10,000 people who were participants in five different clinical trials.\n\nNot only were people with two copies of the APOE4 gene much more likely to develop the biological changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease, similar to people with the other genetic forms of the disease, they were almost assured the diagnosis: Nearly 95% of the people in the studies with two copies of the APOE4 gene had the biology of Alzheimer's disease by the time they were 82 years old.\n\nThe study authors say that while APOE4 reliably causes the biological changes associated with the disease -- the creation of beta amyloid plaques in the brain -- having one or two copies of this gene doesn't always lead to cognitive decline. Rarely, people can have APOE4 and have a lot of beta amyloid in their brain, but not have symptoms, perhaps because of other genetic or environmental factors that protect their brains at the same time. In the large dataset of nearly 3,300 brains kept by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, for example, 273 individuals had two copies of the APOE4 gene, and 240, or 88%, had dementia.\n\nWhen people with two copies of APOE4 do have symptoms, they tend to get them earlier than others. On average, they developed Alzheimer's about 10 years earlier -- around age 65 -- compared with people with other forms of the APOE gene. Researchers also found that the buildup of beta amyloid and tau in their brains followed almost the same trajectory as has been noted in people with other inherited forms of the disease. Their disease was more severe earlier in life.\n\nIn all the inherited forms of the disease, \"there are striking, striking similarities in the way the disease progresses and the symptoms it gets,\" said lead study author Dr. Juan Fortea, a neurologist and director of the Memory Unit of the Neurology Department at Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau in Barcelona, Spain, in a news briefing.\n\nFortea and his co-authors argue that for these reasons, having two copies of the APOE4 gene should be considered a genetic form of the disease, and not merely a risk for it.\n\nDr. Charles Bernick, who is associate medical director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, said the study was important because it really showed how powerful having two copies of the APOE4 gene was.\n\n\"It really drives a disease process,\" said Bernick, who was not involved in the study.\n\nShifting understanding of genetic risks\n\nThe strength of APOE4's role in the development of Alzheimer's wasn't recognized earlier, the researchers think, because APOE4 also plays an important role in heart health, and they think many people with two copies of the gene probably died from cardiovascular causes before they developed Alzheimer's. Previous studies had estimated that 30-35% of people with two copies of the APOE4 gene would develop mild cognitive impairment or dementia.\n\nResearchers say they also found a gene-dose effect. While having two copies of APOE4 assured that a person would see beta amyloid and tau build up in their brains, having just one copy of the gene also increased a person's risk -- but not as much as having two copies of that gene.\n\nThat would mean that the APOE4 gene is semi-dominant, Fortea said. Other diseases where genes show semi-dominance include sickle cell anemia and hypercholesterolemia. In sickle cell, for example, two copies of the gene cause sickle cell disease, but one copy causes sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait don't usually have symptoms, but they may be more likely to experience heat stroke or muscle breakdown during strenuous exercise, and they can experience pain crises under certain conditions.\n\nClassifying APOE4 as an inherited form of the disease has some big implications. First, it would mean that a far greater proportion of Alzheimer's cases are caused by genes than has been previously understood.\n\nBefore APOE4, the only gene changes recognized to cause Alzheimer's were associated with early-onset forms of the disease and with Down's syndrome. They accounted for about 2% of Alzheimer's cases -- about 1 in 50.\n\nPeople with two copies of the APOE4 gene make up about 15% of people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer's, or 1 in 7 cases of the disease.\n\nAbout 2% of the general population carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which would make it one of the most prevalent inherited diseases.\n\nGene testing isn't currently recommended\n\nIt is also likely to change how people who carry the APOE4 gene are diagnosed and treated.\n\nThere are tests available to determine a person's APOE4 status, but they're not recommended as a routine part of diagnosis. That may need to change, the study authors said.\n\n\"The consensus and the guidelines now do not recommend testing for APOE4 and that was because the consensus was that it did not help for the diagnosis,\" Fortea said.\n\nAPOE testing is recommended for patients who are being evaluated to take new amyloid-clearing medications, such as lecanemab.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nBecause Alzheimer's patients with two copies of the APOE4 gene are at greater risk for serious side effects like brain swelling from new amyloid-clearing medications, some treatment centers have decided not to offer them the drugs, said study author Dr. Reisa Sperling, director of the center for Alzheimer's Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n\n\"I find this very problematic given these data,\" she said, noting that it would be important to do research to see if it might be possible to find safer dosing or safer treatments for this patient group.\n\n\"For me, this just means we need to treat them earlier,\" Sperling said, \"and this research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age, and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly.\"\n\nDr. Sterling Johnson, who leads the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention at the University of Wisconsin, said it would be very important for clinical trials to start to take participants' APOE4 status into account.\n\n\"We may need to start treating these as a separate group in our research papers so that we can really understand the relationship between amyloid and tau and symptoms\" in people with two copies of the APOE4 gene, in a way that we kind of have not been able to before, said Johnson, who is also a study author, in the news briefing.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news",

It was during this time that I realized the urgent need for support and research to combat this debilitating disease.\"\n\nAlzheimer's Association Louisiana chapter advocates gathered on the Capitol steps for a rally around Alzheimer's and dementia awareness. Afterwards, they met with their legislators to continue to rally support for Senate Bill 46.\n\nAdvocates urged their elected officials to back SB46, which will establish the Alzheimer's and Related Dementias Advisory Council and ensure that Alzheimer's and related dementias remain a public health priority in Louisiana.\n\n\"SB46 would ensure that Alzheimer's and related dementias remain a top public health priority in Louisiana by establishing a comprehensive and collaborative effort between the private sector and state agencies.

Now her grieving children face an awful dilemma...", "body": "In the 1980s, Nottingham schoolteacher Carol Jennings penned a short letter which changed the way the world understood Alzheimer's dementia.\n\n'I think my family could be of use,' it began.\n\nMany years and billions of pounds in research funding later, it would lead to the first effective drugs for the degenerative brain disease which have recently emerged. Carol's letter, to top neurologist Professor John Hardy, detailed how her family had been blighted by dementia.\n\nHer 63-year-old father Walter had it, she wrote, 'as does his sister, Audrey. His brother, Arthur, also may have the disease.'\n\nCarol Jennings, who died late last month aged 70, with children Emily and John and their father, Stuart\n\nCarol, pictured with Emily, John and Stuart, wrote a short letter in the 1980s which changed the way the world understood Alzheimer's\n\nAt the time, relatively little was known about Alzheimer's aside from that it was seen as an inevitability of old age for some. 'My doctor keeps telling me it doesn't run in the family but... it clearly does,' Carol's letter continued.\n\nProf Hardy says Carol's letter was a watershed moment. 'We'd been trying to find genetic mutations that might lead to Alzheimer's for some time,' he recalls. 'So we put out an advert in the Alzheimer's Society newsletter looking for families with a strong history of the disease. Carol's letter was the first response I read.'\n\nThe researchers took blood samples from the Jennings family and, several years later, concluded that many of them carried the same genetic defect - which triggered a rare hereditary form of Alzheimer's.\n\nThese remarkable events will feature in a BBC Two documentary which followed Carol, who died late last month aged 70, and her close relatives for two-and-a-half years. The Jennings Family vs Alzheimer's, which airs of May 13, also reveals that Carol's two children, John and Emily, are still grappling with the decision to take a blood test to find out whether they carry the genetic defect.\n\nThey have a 50/50 chance of having the DNA fault, as they may have inherited a healthy copy of the gene from their father who isn't affected. The siblings John, 38, and Emily, 42, fear, quite understandably, that finding out their risk would change their lives forever.\n\nIn Emily's case, it would also mean telling her eight-year-old daughter Eleanor that she could develop Alzheimer's at a young age. The siblings have put off the decision because, until now, there was nothing that could be done to stop the degenerative brain disease.\n\nBut, with the UK approval of two Alzheimer's treatments expected any week now, that could soon change. John, a teacher who lives in Edinburgh with his husband Matt, describes the dilemma as 'the most difficult decision in my life'.\n\n'The desire to have the test has always kind of ebbed and flowed,' he says. 'I don't have any plans for getting old because I don't imagine that I will. At the moment, I kind of overthink everything that could be a symptom of my brain changing.\n\n'You can't help but think maybe it's already happening for me. My biggest fear is losing my connections to people around me. I think that's the thing that I'm scared of, being alone in a scary place.'\n\nEmily, who lives near Leicester, says she is 'pretty much in denial' about her Alzheimer's risk.\n\n'As I've got older, and I've had Eleanor, there's even more to think about, because it has a knock-on impact on her,' she says. 'If I'm getting it, she has a 50/50 chance of getting it. I don't want her thinking about it I suppose.'\n\nBut she says: 'I feel like I don't worry about anything else apart from that. I never go past the next year or two in my mind.'\n\nEmily adds that her husband Mark has repeatedly urged her to get the test, telling her 'you're living your life like you're going to get [Alzheimer's] anyway'.\n\nExperts say the dilemma John and Emily face is representative of the rapidly changing nature of Alzheimer's care. The Jennings family genetic defect means their immune systems are unable to clear a toxic protein from the brain - called amyloid plaque.\n\nResearchers concluded that, over time, this plaque builds up in the brain, triggering Alzheimer's.\n\nThe genetic defect carried by Carol and her family is exceedingly rare. Fewer than 100 people in the UK today are thought to have it. However, the study they participated in was revolutionary because it was the first to pinpoint a cause of Alzheimer's - amyloid plaque.\n\nResearchers noticed during post-mortums that the brains of all deceased Alzheimer's patients were covered in these tangled proteins - regardless of whether they carried this rare genetic defect.\n\nStuart cradles Carol in a moving scene from the BBC Two documentary which followed the family for two-and-a-half years\n\nThe Jennings family at Carol's bedside as they cared for her amid her battle with dementia\n\nCarol, her vicar husband Stuart and baby John. The genetic defect carried by the family is exceedingly rare\n\nCarol would have wanted her children to be tested, believes her widower Stuart, 66\n\nFour decades and thousands of studies later most experts now believe Alzheimer's cases are caused by a buildup of amyloid.\n\nAnd, in 2022, it was announced that two drugs that removed amyloid from the brain were capable of slowing the progress of Alzheimer's by as much as a third - opening up the possibility of a cure.\n\nBoth medicines, lecanemab and donanemab, are given via an infusion every two weeks. They are designed to seek out and destroy amyloid plaque in the brain.\n\nWhen the results from the lecanemab study were published at the end of 2022, some doctors hailed it as 'the beginning of the end' for Alzheimer's. However, the treatments are not without controversy. Both drugs have a high rate of side effects. About one in ten trial participants experienced swelling in the brain and one in six had brain bleeds.\n\nThree patients on the lecanemab trial died as a result of suspected side effects. There were four side effect-related deaths on the donanemab trial. The medicines are also costly. An NHS report published in February suggested that rolling out lecanemab and donanemab would cost the Health Service up to \u00a31billion a year.\n\nMoreover, both treatments are most effective when given to patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's. Currently, there is no effective test to catch the condition early meaning most Britons with Alzheimer's would be diagnosed too late to benefit. However, experts say the fact the drugs can slow Alzheimer's at all means there is hope that, in the coming years, even more effective - and safe - amyloid-attacking medicines will be developed. Earlier this year, UK scientists also announced they had successfully developed a blood test which could spot Alzheimer's - meaning patients could also eventually be diagnosed much earlier, limiting the damage caused by amyloid.\n\n'We are in the treatment phase now for Alzheimer's disease,' says Dr Cath Mummery, a dementia expert at University College London. 'We have a drug. It has a modest effect. It's not the magic bullet that's going to completely reverse the disease. But it's the foundation stone that we can build on.'\n\nExperts say new \u00adAlzheimer's treatments raise hopes for patients most at risk of the disease.\n\nWhile the genetic amyloid defect carried by many of the Jennings family is exceedingly rare, it is not the only early warning sign of the disease. Research suggests around a quarter of the population carry one copy of a gene called APOE4 which doubles their chances of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nAround 3 per cent of people have two copies of APOE4 which can increase the risk of the disease by as much as eight times. In 2022, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, star of the Thor films, revealed he had taken a gene test that showed he had two copies of APOE4.\n\nHowever, for these patients there has been very little that could be done to protect them against Alzheimer's once it arose.\n\nProf Hardy believes that amyloid plaque will eventually be treated like high cholesterol, which can be tackled with a daily statin to stop heart attacks or strokes ever occurring.\n\nThe researchers took blood samples from the Jennings family and, several years later, concluded that many of them carried the same genetic defect\n\nCarol with Emily and baby John. Emily, who is now 42 and lives near Leicester, says she is 'pretty much in denial' about her Alzheimer's risk\n\n'You don't wait to have a heart attack to start taking a statin,' says Prof Hardy. 'I think the same will happen with amyloid drugs. People who are at risk of the disease will start taking them early before the symptoms occur.'\n\nHe added: 'If you'd asked five years ago whether I thought it was worth testing for APOE4 I would have said it wasn't worth it, because there was nothing you could do. But now with treatments available, which will only get better, I think knowing your risk is much more valuable.'\n\nJohn Jennings says the arrival of the two new Alzheimer's drugs makes him feel more optimistic about the future - and could swing him towards getting the test. 'It actually feels like I've got more time,' he says. 'It's taken some of that pressure off. It's so great to see it actually happening.'\n\nHe adds that it makes him feel 'optimistic' his niece Eleanor's generation will have an even better chance, as amyloid drugs continue to improve. However, his sister Emily says she is still unlikely to find out her risk of Alzheimer's because she frets about what testing positive would mean for Eleanor.\n\n'I'd get upset more or I'd worry more about Eleanor,' she says. 'I'd want Eleanor to have the test because I'd want to know whether I'd given it to her. I'm in denial. I definitely don't want to think about it. I do worry if I have any sort of symptom, like cloudy brain. I think this could be the start of it.'\n\nJohn and Emily's father, retired vicar Stuart, 66, says he hopes his children get tested - and believes it is what Carol would have wanted.\n\n'It's too late for Carol I'm afraid, but hopefully not Emily and John,' he says. 'This is what Carol's been working for for over 30 years.'\n\nAdditional reporting by Ethan Ennals.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_plaques", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid plaques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 1826, "textEnd": 1832}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

These findings suggest that having two copies of the APOE4 gene could represent a new genetic form of Alzheimer's disease, as explained by Dr. Fortea.\n\n\"These data represent a reconceptualization of the disease or what it means to be homozygous for the APOE4 gene. This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology. This is important because they represent between 2 and 3% of the population,\" explains this researcher.\n\nNew paradigm\n\nIt is known that mutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are involved in the development of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease -which is clearly considered genetic and can appear from the age of 40- while variants of other genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing sporadic or late-onset forms. Additionally, it was already known that APOE was one of the genes considered the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this work, researchers evaluated clinical, pathological, and biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes to determine their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. They used data from 3,297 brain donors, including samples from 273 APOE4 homozygotes from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (United States) and clinical and biomarker data from over 10,000 individuals, including 519 APOE4 homozygotes from five large multicenter cohorts (from Europe and the United States) of subjects with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.\n\nThe results suggest that virtually all APOE4 homozygotes showed Alzheimer's pathology and had higher levels of disease-associated biomarkers at age 55 compared to individuals with the APOE3 gene. At age 65, over 95% of APOE4 homozygotes showed abnormal levels of amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid - a key early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease - and 75% had positive amyloid scans.\n\nBased on these results, the authors suggest that the genetic variant of the APOE4 gene is not only a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, as previously thought, but could also represent a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"This reconceptualization of the disease is similar to what we proposed from Sant Pau with Down syndrome, which a few years ago was also not considered a genetically determined form of Alzheimer's,\" adds Dr. Fortea.\n\nThe authors note that these findings could be useful for the development of individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials, and targeted treatment approaches for this specific population. In this regard, Dr. Alberto Lle\u00f3, a researcher in the Dementia Neurobiology Group at the Sant Pau Research Institute and Director of the Neurology Service at the same hospital, points out that \"the data clearly show that having two copies of the APOE4 gene not only increases the risk, but also anticipates the onset of Alzheimer's, reinforcing the need for specific preventive strategies.\"\n\nOn his behalf, researcher Dr. V\u00edctor Montal, who actively participated in this study during his time at Sant Pau and now studies the molecular structure of the APOE gene at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, adds that \"the findings emphasize the importance of monitoring APOE4 homozygotes from an early age for preventive interventions.\"\n\n/Public Release.

Medicine. These brain damages lead to the appearance of the first symptoms of Alzheimer's at age 65 on average and dementia at age 74.\n\n\"We have demonstrated the existence of a genetic form of Alzheimer's that until now was not recognized,\" declares neurologist Juan Fortea, first author of the research. Between 2% and 3% of the population of European ancestry is affected by this hereditary form of the disease.\n\nAlthough the discovery will not change the care provided to affected people in the short term, it will allow research to be carried out on this group with the perspective that an early diagnosis will allow access to effective treatment.\n\nGiven that the effectiveness of any treatment for this new form of Alzheimer's has not yet been demonstrated, \"at the moment it is not indicated\" to perform genetic diagnostic tests except in the context of research, Fortea declares.\n\nThe APOE4 variant of the APOE gene was until now considered a genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer's. But no research had distinguished between people who inherit two copies of the APOE4 variant, one from their father and one from their mother, and those who inherit just one.\n\nOther variants of the same gene are APOE3 (the most common, which is considered to neither increase nor reduce the risk of Alzheimer's) and APOE2 (which reduces it).\n\nThe Sant Pau researchers have used public data from 13,336 patients from the US, Canada, Spain, Australia and Japan, which has allowed them to analyze the progression of the disease based on the variants of the APOE gene that each person has. . The Spanish participants are part of a project from the BarcelonaBeta center, the research institute of the Pasqual Maragall Foundation.\n\nThe results confirm that having a copy of the APOE4 variant, as occurs in around 20% of the population of European ancestry, increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's. The important novelty is that having two copies meets the three requirements that define an inherited genetic disease: that all those affected develop the disease (unless they die first from other causes); that the age of onset of symptoms is predictable (as well as for the three other hereditary forms of Alzheimer's); and that the disease process from the onset of symptoms is also predictable.\n\nIf two copies of the APOE4 variant are inherited, the entire Alzheimer's process is advanced by about nine years compared to non-hereditary sporadic cases. The onset of symptoms occurs at an average age of 65 years, instead of 74; dementia at 74, instead of 83; and death at 80, instead of 89.\n\nBetween 15% and 20% of all Alzheimer's cases occur in people who have two copies of the APOE4 variant. Unlike what happens in other hereditary diseases, in this case the disorder can be inherited without having a family history, since it is possible that both the father and the mother have only one copy of the APOE4 variant, but that some of their children have two.\n\n\"There may be different pathways that lead to Alzheimer's pathology but, once it starts, the evolution is similar,\" explains V\u00edctor Montal, a neuroscientist at the Sant Pau hospital and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), who has led the research together to Juan Fortea.\n\nIn the case of the APOE gene, which produces a protein involved in fat metabolism and the transport of cholesterol to neurons, the precise mechanisms by which the APOE4 variant causes Alzheimer's are unknown. The hypotheses suggest that there may be two mechanisms involved. On the one hand, the APOE4 variant is associated with a higher cardiovascular risk, which in turn negatively affects blood flow to the brain and increases the risk of Alzheimer's. On the other hand, APOE4 directly affects the development and maintenance of the brain from childhood.\n\nThe advance \"has crucial implications for the field of Alzheimer's,\" assesses Yadong Huang, from the University of California, San Francisco, in an analysis article published in Nature Medicine. \"It opens new avenues for research [...], for the development of therapies and for the design of clinical trials.\"\n\nFrom now on, clinical trials will have to analyze patients separately based on the number of copies of the APOE4 variant they have. This will allow the evaluation of therapies to slow the disease in people with a higher risk of progressing to dementia at an earlier age than the population average. Likewise, it will allow us to study prevention strategies based on lifestyles, such as the habitual practice of physical activity or following a healthy diet, in this group.\n\n\"Now we have drugs that can modify the course of the disease,\" declares Fortea in reference to the new antibodies against the beta-amyloid protein. \"Clinical trials can be done in this population before symptoms appear.\"\n\nThe research has been financed mainly with contributions from the Government through the Carlos III Health Institute, from the Generalitat through the Health Department and from the 'la

Despite these uncertainties, the drug's ability to affect the biological markers of the disease offers hope and a new avenue for treatment.\n\nAnother significant advancement is the drug Donanemab, which is still in the experimental phase but has shown promising results in early clinical trials. Like Aduhelm, Donanemab targets amyloid plaques in the brain.\n\nIn a phase 2 trial, Donanemab not only reduced amyloid build-up but also slowed down the progression of cognitive decline in early Alzheimer's patients compared to a placebo.\n\nThis drug is currently undergoing further trials to confirm these findings and determine the best dosage and long-term impacts.\n\nBesides these amyloid-targeting drugs, researchers are also exploring treatments that focus on other aspects of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFor example, drugs like Gantenerumab and Lecanemab are in advanced stages of research and target both amyloid plaques and tau proteins -- another substance that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and harms brain cells.\n\nTreatment with these drugs involves regular infusions at a medical facility, and there are potential side effects that patients need to consider, such as the risk of brain swelling or bleeding, which were observed in some trial participants.\n\nThese risks underline the importance of close medical supervision when using these new treatments.\n\nWhile these new drugs represent a significant step forward, it's important for patients and caregivers to maintain realistic expectations. Alzheimer's disease is complex, and no current treatment can cure it entirely.\n\nThe effectiveness of these new drugs can also vary from person to person. However, the advent of these treatments offers new hope and additional options for managing the disease, potentially improving the quality of life for many patients.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of new drugs like Aduhelm and Donanemab opens new possibilities in the fight against Alzheimer's disease by targeting the disease's underlying causes rather than just its symptoms.\n\nAs research continues, these treatments have the potential to transform the landscape of Alzheimer's care, offering hope to patients and families affected by this challenging condition.\n\nIf you care about Alzheimer's disease, please read studies that bad lifestyle habits can cause Alzheimer's disease, and strawberries can be good defence against Alzheimer's.\n\nFor more information about brain health, please see recent studies that oral cannabis extract may help reduce Alzheimer's symptoms, and Vitamin E may help prevent Parkinson's disease.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aducanumab", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aducanumab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donanemab", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donanemab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurological disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathophysiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathophysiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_plaques", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid plaques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Placebo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/What-we-know-about-the-latest-Alzheimer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

they have seen [the disease] in both of their parents.'\n\nMutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, are known to cause a rare form of Alzheimer's known as ADAD - early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThis form of the disease runs in families.\n\nAPOE is one of many other genes associated with Alzheimer's and comes in three different variations: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4.\n\nEveryone carries two copies of APOE, one inherited from each parent.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that having at least one APOE4 gene variant, which about 25% of people in the UK are thought to carry, almost triples the risk of getting the disease, while having two copies increases the risk by up to twelve-fold.\n\nIn the current research, the team found a majority of people with two copies of APOE4 showed signs of the disease by the age of 55, compared with those with another gene variant, such as APOE3.\n\nAnd by the age of 65, 95% had abnormal levels of amyloid protein in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - a key sign of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nScans showed that 75% of those over 65 with the double gene had abnormal build-up of amyloid protein in the brain, which is seven to 10 years earlier than symptom development for other APOE variants.\n\nCommenting on the study, Professor Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: 'At the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future.'\n\nHe said that Alzheimer's UK is funding research projects to try to understand why having the APOE4 gene increases the risk of disease.\n\nDr Richard Oakley, Alzheimer's Society's associate director of research and innovation, added: 'This study has shown us that this particular gene might play an important role in Alzheimer's disease development, suggesting its presence is not only a risk factor, but could also indicate a new form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n'The insights from the study suggest that in the future it could be important to take into account a person's genetics when planning how to reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, or when considering their treatment if they already have the disease.'\n\nMORE : I had a four-month period -

These findings suggest that having two copies of the APOE4 gene could represent a new genetic form of Alzheimer's disease, as explained by Dr. Fortea.\n\n\"These data represent a reconceptualization of the disease or what it means to be homozygous for the APOE4 gene. This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology. This is important because they represent between 2 and 3% of the population,\" explains this researcher.\n\nNew paradigm\n\nIt is known that mutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are involved in the development of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease -which is clearly considered genetic and can appear from the age of 40- while variants of other genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing sporadic or late-onset forms. Additionally, it was already known that APOE was one of the genes considered the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this work, researchers evaluated clinical, pathological, and biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes to determine their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. They used data from 3,297 brain donors, including samples from 273 APOE4 homozygotes from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (United States) and clinical and biomarker data from over 10,000 individuals, including 519 APOE4 homozygotes from five large multicenter cohorts (from Europe and the United States) of subjects with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.\n\nThe results suggest that virtually all APOE4 homozygotes showed Alzheimer's pathology and had higher levels of disease-associated biomarkers at age 55 compared to individuals with the APOE3 gene. At age 65, over 95% of APOE4 homozygotes showed abnormal levels of amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid - a key early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease - and 75% had positive amyloid scans.\n\nBased on these results, the authors suggest that the genetic variant of the APOE4 gene is not only a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, as previously thought, but could also represent a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"This reconceptualization of the disease is similar to what we proposed from Sant Pau with Down syndrome, which a few years ago was also not considered a genetically determined form of Alzheimer's,\" adds Dr. Fortea.\n\nThe authors note that these findings could be useful for the development of individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials, and targeted treatment approaches for this specific population. In this regard, Dr. Alberto Lle\u00f3, a researcher in the Dementia Neurobiology Group at the Sant Pau Research Institute and Director of the Neurology Service at the same hospital, points out that \"the data clearly show that having two copies of the APOE4 gene not only increases the risk, but also anticipates the onset of Alzheimer's, reinforcing the need for specific preventive strategies.\"\n\nOn his behalf, researcher Dr. V\u00edctor Montal, who actively participated in this study during his time at Sant Pau and now studies the molecular structure of the APOE gene at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, adds that \"the findings emphasize the importance of monitoring APOE4 homozygotes from an early age for preventive interventions.\"\n\nInstitut de Recerca Sant Pau (Sant Pau Research Institute)\n\nJournal reference:\n\nFortea, J., et al.

identified a new genetic form of...", "body": "Scientists say they have identified a new genetic form of Alzheimer's disease that underscores the urgent need for developing specialised treatment and prevention strategies.\n\nResearchers in the US said almost all of the people who carry two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, known as APOE4 homozygotes, are likely to develop signs of the neurological condition.\n\nThey said this gene is already associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nBut scientists now believe 95% people who are over 65 and carry two copies of APOE4 show early signs of the disease, making it a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's.\n\nThese people also develop the condition earlier than those with other variants of the APOE gene, they added.\n\nThe findings, published in the journal Nature Medicine, are based on clinical data from more than 10,000 people, as well as pathological data from more than 3,000 brain donors.\n\nScientists say they have identified a new genetic form of Alzheimer\u00b4s disease (Felipe Caparros Cruz/Alamy/PA)\n\nDr Juan Fortea, director of the research area on neurological diseases, neuroscience, and mental health at the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barceclona, Spain, said: \"These data represent a reconceptualisation of the disease or what it means to be homozygous for the APOE4 gene.\n\n\"This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology.\"\n\nHe said the findings are important because APOE4 homozygotes represent between 2% and 3% of the general population.\n\nThis warrants the development of specialised research strategies, treatment approaches and clinical trials for these people, according to the researchers.\n\nDr Reisa Sperling, professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School, and director of the Centre for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, in the US, added: \"This research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very likely to progress to impairment quickly.\n\n\"So we have to think about how we can treat APOE4 carriers.\n\n\"These individuals are desperate - they have seen it (the disease) in both of their parents.\"\n\nNow we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology Dr Juan Fortea\n\nMutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2, are known to cause a rare form of Alzheimer's known as ADAD (early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease).\n\nThis form of the disease runs in families.\n\nAPOE is one of many other genes associated with Alzheimer's and comes in three different variations: APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4.\n\nEveryone carries two copies of APOE, one inherited from each parent.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that having at least one APOE4 gene variant, which about 25% of people in the UK are thought to carry, almost triples the risk of getting the disease, while having two copies increases the risk by up to twelve-fold.\n\nIn the current research, the team found a majority of people with two copies of APOE4 showed signs of the disease by the age of 55, compared with those with another gene variant, such as APOE3.\n\nAnd by the age of 65, almost all (95%) of them had abnormal levels of a protein known as amyloid in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - a key sign of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nAt the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future Prof Jonathan Schott\n\nScans showed that 75% of over-65 APOE4 homozygotes had abnormal build-up of amyloid protein in the brain, which is seven to 10 years earlier than symptom development for other APOE variants.\n\nCommenting on the study, Professor Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, added: \"In this large well-conducted study, researchers showed that people who inherited two copies of APOE4 almost all developed Alzheimer's changes in the brain by their mid 60s.\n\n\"These individuals were more likely to develop dementia and tended to do so at a younger age than those with different APOE combinations.\n\n\"At the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future.\"\n\nHe said that Alzheimer's UK is funding research projects to try to understand why having the APOE4 gene increases the risk of disease.\n\nDr Richard Oakley, Alzheimer's Society's associate director of research and innovation, added: \"This study has shown us that this particular gene might play an important role in Alzheimer's disease development, suggesting its presence is not only a risk factor, but could also indicate a new form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"The insights from the study suggest that in the future it could be important to take into account a person's genetics when planning how to reduce their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, or when considering their treatment if they already have the disease.\"", "source": {"uri":

These fatty molecules play a crucial role in maintaining cell structure, providing energy, and facilitating communication between cells.\n\nThe researchers analyzed medical records, including biomarker test results for Alzheimer's disease, from over 10,000 individuals in the US and Europe, among whom 519 carried two copies of APOE4. They also examined brain samples and medical records from 3,297 deceased individuals who had donated their brains for research, including 273 with two copies of APOE4.\n\nThe study found that almost all APOE4 double carriers showed signs of Alzheimer's disease by the age of 55. Individuals with two copies of APOE4 who developed Alzheimer's symptoms did so around age 65, which is earlier than those with other APOE variants by 7-10 years. The authors suggest that APOE4 may not only be a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease but could also represent a distinct genetic form of the condition.\n\nDr. Juan Fortea, a co-author from the Sant Pau hospital in Barcelona, highlights the similarity between this reconceptualization and the recognition of Down syndrome as a genetically determined form of Alzheimer's in recent years.\n\nOverall, the findings of this study could inform personalized prevention strategies, targeted treatment approaches, and clinical trials for this specific population. While the study provides valuable insights, further research is necessary to understand the effects of APOE4 on a more diverse population, as the study participants were predominantly of European descent.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Molecule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Positron emission tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesterol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cholesterol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Down syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/may/apolipoprotein-06052024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

About 2% to 3% of the general population, or about 15% of people with Alzheimer's, have two copies of the APOE4 variant.\n\n\"This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's if they live long enough, and that they will develop Alzheimer's earlier than people without this gene,\" said professor Tara Spires-Jones, an Alzheimer's researcher at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study.\n\nDr. Juan Fortea of the University of Barcelona and colleagues studied more than 3,000 donated brains from the U.S. National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, as well as biological and clinical data on more than 10,000 individuals from five datasets in three countries.\n\nThey found that by the age of 65, at least 95% of people with two copies of APOE4 - known as homozygotes - had abnormal levels of an Alzheimer's-related protein called beta amyloid in their spinal fluid, and 75% had positive brain scans for amyloid.\n\nNearly all APOE4 homozygotes in the study had higher levels of amyloid at age 65 than people who did not carry the risk variant.\n\nThe findings suggest APOE4 homozygotes meet the three main criteria for being a genetic disease: nearly everyone with these two gene variants have Alzheimer's biology; they develop symptoms at about the same rate; and clinical and biological changes occur in a predictable sequence, the researchers said.\n\nProfessor David Curtis of the UCL Genetics Institute, who was not involved in the research, remained unconvinced. \"I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of APOE4 represents some 'distinct genetic form' of Alzheimer's disease',\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"No matter how many (copies) of APOE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer's disease,\" he said.\n\nThe findings could have implications for the recently approved Alzheimer's treatment Leqembi from Eisai and Biogen, a drug that removes amyloid from the brain.\n\nIn clinical trials, patients with two copies of the APOE4 variant have much higher rates of brain bleeding and swelling associated with the treatment. Because of this, some centers do not treat these patients, Dr. Reisa Sperling, an Alzheimer's researcher at Mass General Brigham who worked on the study, said in a briefing with reporters.\n\n\"This research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early at a younger age and at an early stage of pathology because we know they're very, very likely to progress to impairment quickly,\" she said.\n\nSpires-Jones said the work highlights the need for more research on how genes affect Alzheimer's disease as people age. Other genetic forms of Alzheimer's include Autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's Disease, which is caused by mutations in two different genes, and Down syndrome.\n\nMost of the study population involved people of European ancestry, and the team noted that more work needs to be done in people of African descent, a population in which APOE4 appears to convey a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease.

The first warning sign may be increased activity in certain areas of the brain.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is often diagnosed too late. In most cases, symptoms remain undetected for a long time. Therefore, doctors face a major challenge when treating dementia. While research is focused on understanding the causes, this is more difficult than expected. A US research team has now announced initial success in identifying potential warning signs. In a study conducted on animals, scientists found the \"oldest\". Vital signsFor Alzheimer's disease. The results were published in the specialized journal Embu reports published.\n\nbefore Behavioral changes and memory lapses In addition to the appearance of characteristic beta-amyloid plaques, according to experts, other symptoms appear to be the first indicators of the development of the disease. illness He confesses.

However, at the beginning of the disease, a contradiction arises: It may initially seem counterintuitive that the convulsive activity of brain cells heralds a disease in which neurons die and cognitive abilities decline, according to the journal Science. Science Alert mentioned.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that patients at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease experience increased neuronal activity in the early stages of the disease. This activity was evident in brain scans in certain parts of the brain long before the first symptoms appeared.\n\nChinese researchers discovered in one studyNearly one-third of people tested who had a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease had corresponding \"spells of activity.\" In another study, scientists from... University of California SteadilyPeople with Alzheimer's disease, who have large spikes in brain activity, tend to be diagnosed at an early age.\n\nSeizure-like activity can be caused by nerve cell damage. However, the mechanisms underlying neuronal excitability in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease remain unclear. Previous research suggests that abnormal levels of calcium ions in cells and amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques, a major feature of Alzheimer's disease, may be responsible for changes in activity.\n\nMolecular biologist Yeeun Yook of the University of Illinois and his colleagues also discovered a neuron-specific protein (PSD-95). The protein enhances the excitatory activity of synapses, the connections between nerve cells, by recruiting more receptors. In a series of behavioral and tissue experiments on mice, the researchers found elevated levels of PSD-95 caused by the presence of A\u03b2. The researchers were also able to show how the protein was the driving force behind seizure activity. On the other hand, PSD-95 inhibition caused less synaptic activity and fewer seizures in mice.\n\n\"Our results show that PSD-95 is a major contributor to hyperexcitability in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease,\" says Nien-Pei Tsai, a molecular biologist at the University of Illinois and lead author of the study. \"So we think that PSD-95 could be an early biomarker that indicates that a patient may have Alzheimer's disease or increased susceptibility to seizures,\" Nien-Pei Tsai said.\n\nOf course, translating these findings into clinical applications will still require a lot of work. However, researchers are confident that PSD-85 could be a new warning marker in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. \"Verifying this prediction could support our original hypothesis that PSD-95-dependent neuronal defects occur early in the disease and that inhibiting PSD-95, at least in the early phase of the disease, can slow the progression of symptoms.\" The team concluded.", "source": {"uri": "thewestonforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspetuck News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "faye_stephens@thewestonforum.com", "name": "Faye Stephens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLG4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DLG4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Molecular biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_postsynaptic_potential", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Excitatory postsynaptic potential"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Synapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calcium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Receptor (biochemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tissue (biology)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://www.fehmarn24.de/assets/images/34/15/34015213-neuroscience-gehirn-hirn-alzheimer-demenz-erinnerungsvermoegen-studie-gesundheit-wissenschaft-Ufe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The predictability of symptom onset and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes mirrored those in autosomal dominant AD and Down syndrome.\n\nHowever, in the dementia stage, there were no differences in amyloid or tau positron emission tomography across haplotypes, despite earlier clinical and biomarker changes.\n\nThe study concludes that APOE4 homozygotes represent a genetic form of AD, suggesting the need for individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials and treatments.", "source": {"uri": "neurosciencenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neuroscience News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Positron emission tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid-beta_precursor_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid-beta precursor protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSEN2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSEN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early-onset_Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2024/05/apoe4-genetics-alzheimers-neurosicence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It usually begins with mild symptoms that gradually worsen over time.\n\nAlthough the disease is most commonly associated with aging, there is a genetic component that can influence a person's risk of developing it.\n\nThe link between genetics and Alzheimer's can be categorized into two types: familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Familial Alzheimer's is rare, making up only about 1-5% of all cases.\n\nIt involves genetic mutations that are directly inherited from a parent. These mutations are located in one of three genes: the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin-1 (PSEN1), and presenilin-2 (PSEN2).\n\nA mutation in any of these genes can lead to the development of Alzheimer's symptoms before the age of 65, often as early as a person's 40s or 50s.\n\nSporadic Alzheimer's, which is far more common, usually occurs in people over the age of 65 and does not follow a clear pattern of inheritance. However, genetics still play a role.\n\nThe most significant genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's is the presence of a gene called apolipoprotein E (APOE). APOE comes in several different forms, or alleles, one of which is called APOE \u03b54.\n\nHaving one or two copies of the APOE \u03b54 allele increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's. It's important to note that not everyone with an APOE \u03b54 allele will develop Alzheimer's, and not all Alzheimer's patients have the APOE \u03b54 allele. This indicates that while genetics are a risk factor, they are not the sole cause of the disease.\n\nResearchers continue to study how these genes affect the development of Alzheimer's. For example, they have discovered that the APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 mutations lead to an overproduction of a toxic protein fragment called beta-amyloid.\n\nThe accumulation of beta-amyloid plaques in the brain is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. In those with the APOE \u03b54 allele, the protein affects how beta-amyloid is cleared from the brain, leading to these same plaques.\n\nUnderstanding the genetic link to Alzheimer's helps researchers develop potential treatments. For instance, current research is focused on creating medications that can reduce the production of beta-amyloid or enhance its clearance from the brain.\n\nAdditionally, knowing a person's genetic status can lead to earlier interventions and personalized treatment plans.\n\nHowever, genetics are just one piece of the Alzheimer's puzzle. Environmental factors and lifestyle choices such as diet, exercise, and cognitive engagement also play critical roles in the disease's development and progression.\n\nStudies suggest that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can mitigate some of the genetic risks of Alzheimer's.\n\nFor those with a family history of Alzheimer's, genetic testing may be an option. However, it's a decision that should be made in consultation with medical professionals and genetic counselors, considering the emotional and psychological impacts of knowing one's genetic risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while genetics play a crucial role in Alzheimer's disease, they do not determine destiny.\n\nWith ongoing research and improved understanding, the hope is that better treatments and preventive strategies can be developed, potentially changing the lives of those at risk for this debilitating disease.\n\nIf you care about Alzheimer's, please read studies about the likely cause of Alzheimer's disease , and new non-drug treatment that could help prevent Alzheimer's.\n\nFor more information about brain health, please see recent studies about diet that may help prevent Alzheimer's, and results showing some dementia cases could be prevented by changing these 12 things.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSEN2", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PSEN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid-beta_precursor_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid-beta precursor protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amnesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heredity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_counseling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic counseling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://knowridge.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Decoding-the-genetic-puzzle-of-Alzheimer.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease is critical in medical settings, as it supports early intervention and treatment planning and contributes to expanding our knowledge of the dynamics of Alzheimer's disease in the brain. Lately, ensemble deep learning has become popular for enhancing the performance and reliability of Alzheimer's disease diagnosis.

Carol's letter, to top neurologist Professor John Hardy, detailed how her family had been blighted by dementia.\n\nHer 63-year-old father Walter had it, she wrote, 'as does his sister, Audrey. His brother, Arthur, also may have the disease.'\n\nCarol Jennings, who died late last month aged 70, with children Emily and John and their father, Stuart\n\nCarol, pictured with Emily, John and Stuart, wrote a short letter in the 1980s which changed the way the world understood Alzheimer's\n\nAt the time, relatively little was known about Alzheimer's aside from that it was seen as an inevitability of old age for some. 'My doctor keeps telling me it doesn't run in the family but... it clearly does,' Carol's letter continued.\n\nProf Hardy says Carol's letter was a watershed moment. 'We'd been trying to find genetic mutations that might lead to Alzheimer's for some time,' he recalls. 'So we put out an advert in the Alzheimer's Society newsletter looking for families with a strong history of the disease. Carol's letter was the first response I read.'\n\nThe researchers took blood samples from the Jennings family and, several years later, concluded that many of them carried the same genetic defect - which triggered a rare hereditary form of Alzheimer's.\n\nThese remarkable events will feature in a BBC Two documentary which followed Carol, who died late last month aged 70, and her close relatives for two-and-a-half years. The Jennings Family vs Alzheimer's, which airs of May 13, also reveals that Carol's two children, John and Emily, are still grappling with the decision to take a blood test to find out whether they carry the genetic defect.\n\nThey have a 50/50 chance of having the DNA fault, as they may have inherited a healthy copy of the gene from their father who isn't affected. The siblings John, 38, and Emily, 42, fear, quite understandably, that finding out their risk would change their lives forever.\n\nIn Emily's case, it would also mean telling her eight-year-old daughter Eleanor that she could develop Alzheimer's at a young age. The siblings have put off the decision because, until now, there was nothing that could be done to stop the degenerative brain disease.\n\nBut, with the UK approval of two Alzheimer's treatments expected any week now, that could soon change. John, a teacher who lives in Edinburgh with his husband Matt, describes the dilemma as 'the most difficult decision in my life'.\n\n'The desire to have the test has always kind of ebbed and flowed,' he says. 'I don't have any plans for getting old because I don't imagine that I will. At the moment, I kind of overthink everything that could be a symptom of my brain changing.\n\nREAD MORE: My dementia sufferer mother has been paying my brother thousands.

My biggest fear is losing my connections to people around me. I think that's the thing that I'm scared of, being alone in a scary place.'\n\nEmily, who lives near Leicester, says she is 'pretty much in denial' about her Alzheimer's risk.\n\n'As I've got older, and I've had Eleanor, there's even more to think about, because it has a knock-on impact on her,' she says. 'If I'm getting it, she has a 50/50 chance of getting it. I don't want her thinking about it I suppose.'\n\nBut she says: 'I feel like I don't worry about anything else apart from that. I never go past the next year or two in my mind.'\n\nEmily adds that her husband Mark has repeatedly urged her to get the test, telling her 'you're living your life like you're going to get [Alzheimer's] anyway'.\n\nExperts say the dilemma John and Emily face is representative of the rapidly changing nature of Alzheimer's care. The Jennings family genetic defect means their immune systems are unable to clear a toxic protein from the brain - called amyloid plaque.\n\nResearchers concluded that, over time, this plaque builds up in the brain, triggering Alzheimer's.\n\nThe genetic defect carried by Carol and her family is exceedingly rare. Fewer than 100 people in the UK today are thought to have it. However, the study they participated in was revolutionary because it was the first to pinpoint a cause of Alzheimer's - amyloid plaque.\n\nResearchers noticed during post-mortums that the brains of all deceased Alzheimer's patients were covered in these tangled proteins - regardless of whether they carried this rare genetic defect.\n\nStuart cradles Carol in a moving scene from the BBC Two documentary which followed the family for two-and-a-half years\n\nThe Jennings family at Carol's bedside as they cared for her amid her battle with dementia\n\nCarol, her vicar husband Stuart and baby John. The genetic defect carried by the family is exceedingly rare\n\nCarol would have wanted her children to be tested, believes her widower Stuart, 66\n\nFour decades and thousands of studies later most experts now believe Alzheimer's cases are caused by a buildup of amyloid.\n\nAnd, in 2022, it was announced that two drugs that removed amyloid from the brain were capable of slowing the progress of Alzheimer's by as much as a third - opening up the possibility of a cure.\n\nBoth medicines, lecanemab and donanemab, are given via an infusion every two weeks. They are designed to seek out and destroy amyloid plaque in the brain.\n\nWhen the results from the lecanemab study were published at the end of 2022, some doctors hailed it as 'the beginning of the end' for Alzheimer's. However, the treatments are not without controversy. Both drugs have a high rate of side effects. About one in ten trial participants experienced swelling in the brain and one in six had brain bleeds.\n\nThree patients on the lecanemab trial died as a result of suspected side effects. There were four side effect-related deaths on the donanemab trial. The medicines are also costly. An NHS report published in February suggested that rolling out lecanemab and donanemab would cost the Health Service up to \u00a31billion a year.\n\nMoreover, both treatments are most effective when given to patients in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's. Currently, there is no effective test to catch the condition early meaning most Britons with Alzheimer's would be diagnosed too late to benefit. However, experts say the fact the drugs can slow Alzheimer's at all means there is hope that, in the coming years, even more effective - and safe - amyloid-attacking medicines will be developed. Earlier this year, UK scientists also announced they had successfully developed a blood test which could spot Alzheimer's - meaning patients could also eventually be diagnosed much earlier, limiting the damage caused by amyloid.\n\n'We are in the treatment phase now for Alzheimer's disease,' says Dr Cath Mummery, a dementia expert at University College London. 'We have a drug. It has a modest effect. It's not the magic bullet that's going to completely reverse the disease. But it's the foundation stone that we can build on.'\n\nExperts say new \u00adAlzheimer's treatments raise hopes for patients most at risk of the disease.\n\nWhile the genetic amyloid defect carried by many of the Jennings family is exceedingly rare, it is not the only early warning sign of the disease. Research suggests around a quarter of the population carry one copy of a gene called APOE4 which doubles their chances of developing Alzheimer's.\n\nAround 3 per cent of people have two copies of APOE4 which can increase the risk of the disease by as much as eight times. In 2022, Australian actor Chris Hemsworth, star of the Thor films, revealed he had taken a gene test that showed he had two copies of APOE4.\n\nHowever, for these patients there has been very little that could be done to protect them against Alzheimer's once it arose.\n\nProf Hardy believes that amyloid plaque will eventually be treated like high cholesterol, which can be tackled with a daily statin to stop heart attacks or strokes ever occurring.\n\nThe researchers took blood samples from the Jennings family and, several years later, concluded that many of them carried the same genetic defect\n\nCarol with Emily and baby John. Emily, who is now 42 and lives near Leicester, says she is 'pretty much in denial' about her Alzheimer's risk\n\n'You don't wait to have a heart attack to start taking a statin,' says Prof Hardy. 'I think the same will happen with amyloid drugs. People who are at risk of the disease will start taking them early before the symptoms occur.'\n\nHe added: 'If you'd asked five years ago whether I thought it was worth testing for APOE4 I would have said it wasn't worth it, because there was nothing you could do. But now with treatments available, which will only get better, I think knowing your risk is much more valuable.'\n\nJohn Jennings says the arrival of the two new Alzheimer's drugs makes him feel more optimistic about the future - and could swing him towards getting the test. 'It actually feels like I've got more time,' he says. 'It's taken some of that pressure off. It's so great to see it actually happening.'\n\nHe adds that it makes him feel 'optimistic' his niece Eleanor's generation will have an even better chance, as amyloid drugs continue to improve. However, his sister Emily says she is still unlikely to find out her risk of Alzheimer's because she frets about what testing positive would mean for Eleanor.\n\n'I'd get upset more or I'd worry more about Eleanor,' she says. 'I'd want Eleanor to have the test because I'd want to know whether I'd given it to her. I'm in denial. I definitely don't want to think about it. I do worry if I have any sort of symptom, like cloudy brain. I think this could be the start of it.'\n\nJohn and Emily's father, retired vicar Stuart, 66, says he hopes his children get tested - and believes it is what Carol would have wanted.\n\n'It's too late for Carol I'm afraid, but hopefully not Emily and John,' he says. 'This is what Carol's been working for for over 30 years.'\n\nAdditional reporting by Ethan Ennals.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_plaques", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid plaques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toxicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leicester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hemsworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/04/15/84454491-0-image-m-16_1714831727910.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 1826, "textEnd": 1832}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

These findings suggest that having two copies of the APOE4 gene could represent a new genetic form of Alzheimer's disease, as explained by Dr. Fortea.\n\n\"These data represent a reconceptualization of the disease or what it means to be homozygous for the APOE4 gene. This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology. This is important because they represent between 2 and 3% of the population,\" explains this researcher.\n\nNew paradigm\n\nIt is known that mutations in three genes, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are involved in the development of autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer's disease -which is clearly considered genetic and can appear from the age of 40- while variants of other genes have been associated with an increased risk of developing sporadic or late-onset forms. Additionally, it was already known that APOE was one of the genes considered the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease.\n\nIn this work, researchers evaluated clinical, pathological, and biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes to determine their risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. They used data from 3,297 brain donors, including samples from 273 APOE4 homozygotes from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (United States) and clinical and biomarker data from over 10,000 individuals, including 519 APOE4 homozygotes from five large multicenter cohorts (from Europe and the United States) of subjects with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers.\n\nThe results suggest that virtually all APOE4 homozygotes showed Alzheimer's pathology and had higher levels of disease-associated biomarkers at age 55 compared to individuals with the APOE3 gene. At age 65, over 95% of APOE4 homozygotes showed abnormal levels of amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid - a key early pathological feature in Alzheimer's disease - and 75% had positive amyloid scans.\n\nBased on these results, the authors suggest that the genetic variant of the APOE4 gene is not only a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, as previously thought, but could also represent a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"This reconceptualization of the disease is similar to what we proposed from Sant Pau with Down syndrome, which a few years ago was also not considered a genetically determined form of Alzheimer's,\" adds Dr. Fortea.\n\nThe authors note that these findings could be useful for the development of individualized prevention strategies, clinical trials, and targeted treatment approaches for this specific population. In this regard, Dr. Alberto Lle\u00f3, a researcher in the Dementia Neurobiology Group at the Sant Pau Research Institute and Director of the Neurology Service at the same hospital, points out that \"the data clearly show that having two copies of the APOE4 gene not only increases the risk, but also anticipates the onset of Alzheimer's, reinforcing the need for specific preventive strategies.\"\n\nOn his behalf, researcher Dr. V\u00edctor Montal, who actively participated in this study during his time at Sant Pau and now studies the molecular structure of the APOE gene at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, adds that \"the findings emphasize the importance of monitoring APOE4 homozygotes from an early age for preventive interventions.\"", "source": {"uri": "scienmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scienmag: Latest Science and Health News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebrospinal_fluid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cerebrospinal fluid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Neuroscience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Positron emission tomography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid-beta_precursor_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid-beta precursor protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSEN2", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSEN2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early-onset_Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominance (genetics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paradigm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Medical", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Medical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://scienmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Study-reveals-APOE4-gene-duplication-as-a-new-genetic-form.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Inhibiting PSD-95 slowed disease progression, offering a new avenue for early diagnosis and treatment.\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have identified the earliest-known biomarker for Alzheimer's disease in a study using a mouse model: a surge in a brain-specific protein. Furthermore, the increased protein activity leads to the seizures associated with the earliest stages of neurodegeneration, and inhibiting the protein in the mice slowed the onset and progression of seizure activity.\n\nThe neural-specific protein, PSD-95, could pose a new target for Alzheimer's research, early diagnosis, and treatment, said study leader Nien-Pei Tsai, an Illinois professor of molecular and integrative physiology.\n\nTsai's group studies mice that make more of the proteins that form amyloid-beta, which progressively aggregates in Alzheimer's disease to form plaques in the brain that hamper neural activity. However, in the new work, the group focused on a time frame much earlier in the mouse lifespan than others have studied - when no other markers or abnormalities have been reported, Tsai said.\n\n\"We were thinking, if we can catch anything that is happening early enough, maybe we can find a way to diagnose the disease earlier or slow down the progression,\" Tsai said. \"We know that Alzheimer's is irreversible. But if we can slow down the progression or even delay the onset of the disease, we can improve the quality of life for patients.\"\n\nWhile watching early neural development, first in neuron cultures and then in live mice, the researchers saw an elevation in PSD-95 levels. The PSD-95 protein's job is to attract and pull other receptors to the synaptic surface - the space where two neurons pass signals to one another.\n\n\"Our data suggests that the elevated PSD-95 is contributing to hyperexcitability in the brain. That's a common phenotype is some of the early stages of Alzheimer's disease patients: They tend to have hyperexcitability or elevated seizure susceptibility in the brain, preceding and exacerbating the neurodegeneration that follows,\" said Tsai, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute of Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I.\n\nTo confirm that increased PSD-95 was a driving force behind the seizure activity, the researchers inhibited PSD-95 in a mouse cohort. They saw reduced receptor activity at the synapse, fewer seizures in the mice and reduced mortality from seizures.\n\n\"Our findings show that PSD-95 is a critical contributor to the hyperexcitability in the earliest stages of Alzheimer's. So we think that PSD-95 can be an early biomarker to indicate that a patient could have Alzheimer's disease or elevated seizure susceptibility. In terms of treatment, antibody inhibitors for PSD-95 could be useful in the early onset of Alzheimer's, with more clinical study.\"\n\nThe group published its findings in the journal EMBO Reports.\n\nThe researchers hope to partner with clinical research teams to determine whether their findings in mice correlate with samples from human patients. They also plan to study other receptors that PSD-95 interacts with on the synaptic surface to see if it plays a role in other symptoms of the disease or stages of its progression.\n\n\"For example, the NMDA receptor has been shown to contribute to neural cell death in Alzheimer's disease. So we're trying to see whether by inhibiting PSD-95, we also can inhibit this particular NMDA receptor to slow down cell death.\"\n\nReference: \"Hyperfunction of post-synaptic density protein 95 promotes seizure response in early-stage a\u03b2 pathology\" by Yeeun Yook, Kwan Young Lee, Eunyoung Kim, Simon Lizarazo, Xinzhu Yu and Nien-Pei Tsai, 27 February 2024, EMBO Reports.\n\nDOI: 10.1038/s44319-024-00090-0\n\nThe National Institutes of Health and the Alzheimer's Association supported this work.", "source": {"uri": "scitechdaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SciTechDaily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLG4", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DLG4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medical diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegenerative_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neurodegenerative disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid beta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_aggregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protein aggregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_organism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Model organism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Receptor (biochemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phenotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synapse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Synapse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cell death"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cancer", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cancer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Immunology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Smell_and_Taste", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Smell and Taste", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://scitechdaily.com/images/Neurons-Alzheimers-Disease-Concept-Art.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Interestingly, it might also give us early clues about the health of our brain.\n\nAt the University of Chicago Medicine, researchers have discovered that a decrease in how well someone can smell things over time could indicate problems with their brain health, specifically pointing to conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\n\nTheir findings, shared in the journal \"Alzheimer's & Dementia,\" show that simple smell tests could potentially help spot these brain issues earlier than other methods currently in use.\n\nAlzheimer's disease affects over 6 million Americans and involves not just memory loss, but also changes in mood and difficulty with daily tasks. Recognizing these problems early on can be crucial for managing the disease effectively.\n\nThis study looked at data from a large project called the Memory and Aging Project, which tracks older adults to learn more about chronic diseases and brain health.\n\nParticipants were regularly tested on their ability to identify different smells, their memory, and thinking skills, and checked for signs of dementia.\n\nWhat the researchers found was quite significant: those who experienced a quicker drop in their smell-sensing ability, even while their thinking skills seemed normal, were more likely to show signs of Alzheimer's later on.\n\nThis included having less gray matter in certain parts of the brain, which are crucial for memory and smell, showing poorer cognitive function, and having a higher risk of developing dementia.\n\nThe researchers noted that the risk linked to losing one's sense of smell was comparable to the risk associated with carrying a specific gene known to increase Alzheimer's risk, the APOE-e4 gene.\n\nFurther research is planned to confirm these findings and to explore how examining brain tissues and using smell tests might help detect Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia earlier.\n\nThe researchers also want to include a wider variety of participants to see if these findings hold true across different groups.\n\nThe study has highlighted the importance of the sense of smell not only in our daily lives but as a potential key indicator of our brain health as we age.\n\nPrevious studies by the same team had already shown that older adults who lose their sense of smell completely are at a much higher risk of dying within five years compared to those with heart failure, lung disease, or cancer.\n\nSuch research underscores the potential of smell tests not only in diagnosing diseases like Alzheimer's early but also in understanding the overall health risks associated with sensory loss as we age.\n\nThis could lead to new ways to manage, treat, or even prevent serious health issues before they fully develop.\n\nThis study is a reminder of how interconnected our bodily senses are with our overall health, especially brain health, and could lead to breakthroughs in how we approach the diagnosis and management of diseases that affect millions of people around the world.\n\nIf you care about Alzheimer's, please read

CST includes activities and exercises specifically designed to stimulate thinking skills and engage the mind.\n\nResearch indicates that regular cognitive stimulation can help improve memory, problem-solving skills, and language ability in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's.\n\nThese improvements can make a significant difference in a patient's ability to perform everyday tasks independently.\n\nPhysical activity is another crucial intervention. Regular exercise, particularly aerobic exercise, has been shown to have numerous benefits for Alzheimer's patients. It can help improve motor skills, decrease the risk of falls, and even slow down cognitive decline.\n\nActivities like walking, light aerobics, and tai chi not only boost physical health but also contribute to better mood and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety, all of which can help patients maintain a higher level of independence.\n\nSocial interaction is vitally important for Alzheimer's patients. Maintaining social connections through group activities, family visits, or social outings can provide emotional support, reduce feelings of isolation, and stimulate cognitive functions.\n\nEngaging in social activities can help preserve the patient's communication skills and improve their quality of life.\n\nOccupational therapy (OT) plays a key role in helping Alzheimer's patients remain independent. Occupational therapists assess patients' needs and adapt their living environments to enhance safety and functionality.\n\nThis may include recommending special equipment to assist with daily tasks, or modifying the home layout to make it more navigable for someone with cognitive impairments.\n\nOT aims to empower patients by enabling them to perform daily activities such as dressing, cooking, and personal hygiene with greater ease and less assistance.\n\nAnother intervention is the use of technology. Assistive technology devices, such as automatic medication dispensers, GPS trackers, and simplified smartphone apps, can help patients manage daily tasks, remain safe, and stay connected with others.\n\nThese technologies can compensate for memory loss and other cognitive challenges, thereby supporting a patient's ability to stay independent.\n\nDiet and nutrition also play a significant role in managing Alzheimer's disease. A nutritious diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help manage the disease's progression and impact on cognitive function.\n\nNutritional interventions, sometimes including omega-3 fatty acids or antioxidants like vitamin E, have been researched for their potential to improve cognitive functions and overall health.\n\nFinally, structured daily routines can help reduce confusion and anxiety for Alzheimer's patients. A predictable routine minimizes the need for decision-making and memory use, which can be challenging for patients.\n\nHaving a regular schedule for meals, medication, exercise, and sleep can help patients feel more secure and manage their daily lives with less dependence on others.\n\nIn summary, maintaining independence for Alzheimer's patients requires a comprehensive approach that includes cognitive stimulation, physical activity, social engagement, occupational therapy, the use of assistive technologies, dietary management, and a structured daily routine.\n\nThese interventions, supported by ongoing research and practice, are crucial in helping patients manage the symptoms of Alzheimer's while preserving their independence and dignity for as long as possible.\n\nIf you care about Alzheimer's disease, please read studies that bad lifestyle habits can cause Alzheimer's disease, and strawberries can be good defence against Alzheimer's.\n\nFor more information about brain health, please see recent studies that oral cannabis extract may help reduce Alzheimer's symptoms, and Vitamin E may help prevent Parkinson's disease.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Knowridge Science Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Occupational therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobic_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aerobic exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance dependence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cognitive impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physical activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_relation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social relation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_skill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motor skill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assistive technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Chronic_Illness", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Chronic Illness", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The prevalence of biomarkers for the disease also increased with age.\n\nThe team added that the age of symptom onset was about seven to 10 years earlier in people with two copies of ApoE4, at about 65 years, compared with those without the variant.\n\nThe researchers said that with approximately 2% of the general population thought to have two copies of ApoE4, this form of Alzheimer's constituted one of the most frequently occurring diseases that was down to alterations in just one gene.\n\nHowever, with much of the data gathered from people with European ancestry, further work is needed to explore whether the findings hold in people of different ethnicities.\n\nProf Reisa Sperling, a co-author of the study from Brigham and Women's hospital in Boston, US, said while concerns had been raised about using Alzheimer's drugs such as lecanemab in people with two copies of ApoE4, the new work flagged the importance of further research in the area, as well as around other approaches for treatment and prevention in such individuals.\n\nWriting in an associated opinion piece, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco and the city's Gladstone Institutes, said that defining having two copies of ApoE4 as a distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's disease had important consequences, from allowing those affected to receive support through educational and counselling programmes, to prompting new avenues of research, including targeted drug-development. They added that it could also lead to changes in the diagnosis and management of the disease and influence the way clinical trials are designed.\n\nNot everyone agreed with the conclusions of the study. \"I do not see anything in this paper to justify the claim that carrying two copies of ApoE4 represents some 'distinct genetic form' of Alzheimer's disease,\" said Prof David Curtis, an honorary professor at the University College London's Genetics Institute.\n\n\"No matter how many [copies] of ApoE4 one carries the underlying disease processes seem similar across cases of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that any effective treatment and prevention strategies, which have yet to be developed, would have broad applicability,\" he added.", "source": {"uri":

Previously, the quirk -- carried by Avengers star Chris Hemsworth -- had been linked to a 10-fold heightened risk\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss\n\nThese people also developed the condition earlier than those with other variants of the gene, researchers said.\n\nThey believe this is the first study to show that having two copies of APOE4 almost guarantees the onset of the disease.\n\nThe team said their discovery is especially important as around 2 per cent of the population carries two copies of this gene.\n\nAnd it could pinpoint the best people to include in clinical trials for treatment.\n\nWhat is the APO dementia gene?\n\nA person receives a version of the APO gene, a protein scientifically named apolipoprotein E, from each parent when they are conceived. There are three types of the protein: e2, e3 and e4.\n\nAPO is one of more than 20,000 genes a person develops when they are in their mother's womb. Every person has two copies of each gene, inheriting one from each of their parents.\n\nAll versions of APO are responsible for regulating the way the body transports lipids and cholesterol throughout the body.\n\nAround 75 per cent of people have the e2 or e3 varieties, while 20 per cent have one copy of e4 and between 3 and 5 per cent of people have two copies.\n\nThe e4 variant is linked to an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's, whereas e3 appears to have no effect and e2 may even offer protection against the disorder.\n\nPeople born with one copy of the e4 variety suffer a doubled risk of developing Alzheimer's between the ages of 65 and 80.\n\nThose with two copies have a 10 to 15-fold increased risk of developing the disease after the age of 65, scientists estimate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Juan Fortea, director of the research area on neurological diseases, neuroscience and mental health at the Sant Pau Research Institute, said: 'These data represent a reconceptualisation of the disease or what it means to be homozygous for the APOE4 gene.\n\n'This gene has been known for over 30 years and it was known to be associated with a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.\n\n'But now we know that virtually all individuals with this duplicated gene develop Alzheimer's biology.'\n\nThe APOE gene comes in three different variations -- APOE2, APOE3 and APOE4.\n\nEveryone carries two copies of APOE, one inherited from each parent. Previous studies have shown that having at least one APOE4 gene variant, which about a quarter of people in the UK are thought to carry, almost triples the risk of getting the disease.\n\nThe new research showed that by the age of 65, almost all people who had two copies of APOE4 had anormal levels of a protein known as amyloid in the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - a key sign of Alzheimer's.\n\nDr Reisa Sperling, professor in neurology at Harvard Medical School, and director of the Centre for Alzheimer Research and Treatment at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, said: 'We have to think about how we can treat APOE4 carriers.\n\n'These individuals are desperate -- they have seen it (the disease) in both of their parents.\n\n'This research really suggests that we should be treating them quite early, at a younger age and at an early stage of pathology because we know they are very likely to progress to impairment quickly.'\n\nCommenting on the findings Professor Tara Spires-Jones, president of the British Neuroscience Association, said: 'This study adds compelling data to suggest that people with two copies of this gene are almost guaranteed to develop Alzheimer's if they live long enough and that they will develop Alzheimer's earlier than people without this gene.\n\n'Moving forward, this study and others highlight the importance of more fundamental research into understanding how genes change the susceptibility of our brains to Alzheimer's disease as we age.'\n\nProfessor Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, also said the charity was currently funding research projects to try to understand why having the APOE4 gene increases the risk of disease.\n\n'At the present time we do not advise that people have genetic testing for APOE except when taking part in research, but this may change in the future,' he added.\n\nThe study was published in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nAround 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around 7million in the US.\n\nAlzheimer's affects around six in 10 people with dementia.\n\nIt is thought to be caused by a build-up of amyloid and tau in the brain, which clump together and from plaques and tangles that make it harder for the brain to work properly.\n\nEventually, the brain struggles to cope with this damage and dementia symptoms develop.\n\nMemory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which then worsen over time.\n\nAlzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.\n\nWhat is Alzheimer's?\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease of the brain, in which build-up of abnormal proteins causes nerve cells to die.\n\nThis disrupts the transmitters that carry messages, and causes the brain to shrink.\n\nMore than 5 million people suffer from the disease in the US, where it is the 6th leading cause of death, and more than 1 million Britons have it.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS?\n\nAs brain cells die, the functions they provide are lost.\n\nThat includes memory, orientation and the ability to think and reason.\n\nThe progress of the disease is slow and gradual.\n\nOn average, patients live five to seven years after diagnosis, but some may live for ten to 15 years.\n\nEARLY SYMPTOMS:\n\nLoss of short-term memoryDisorientationBehavioral changesMood swingsDifficulties dealing with money or making a phone call\n\nLATER SYMPTOMS:\n\nSevere memory loss, forgetting close family members, familiar objects or placesBecoming anxious and frustrated over inability to make sense of the world, leading to aggressive behavior Eventually lose ability to walkMay have problems eating The majority will eventually need 24-hour care\n\nSource: Alzheimer's

However, many of the mechanisms that drive this \"gut-brain axis\" are unknown.\n\nGut metabolites are released by bacteria as they break down the food an individual has eaten, and these metabolites then go on to influence many cellular processes throughout the body. The researchers noted that these interactions can be helpful to human health in many cases, but links between metabolites and a host of conditions -- like cancer and Parkinson's disease, alongside Alzheimer's -- have been documented.\n\nThe significant impact of the gut microbiome in these cases has led researchers to explore how drugs or other therapeutics could prevent harmful metabolite interactions.\n\n\"Gut metabolites are the key to many physiological processes in our bodies, and for every key there is a lock for human health and disease,\" explained Feixiong Cheng, PhD, inaugural director of the Cleveland Clinic Genome Center, in a news release. \"The problem is that we have tens of thousands of receptors and thousands of metabolites in our system, so manually figuring out which key goes into which lock has been slow and costly.\"\n\nTo combat this, the research team used machine learning to study how metabolites and cell receptors interact in the context of Alzheimer's disease. By integrating information on metabolite shapes and receptor protein structures, genetic and proteomic data and metabolites' known impact on patient-derived brain cells, the approach enabled researchers to analyze over 1.09 million potential metabolite-receptor pairs.\n\nThis data was used to rank metabolites and receptors based on the likelihood that they would interact with each other, which informed predictions around the likelihood that the pair would contribute to Alzheimer's.\n\nFrom there, the metabolite-receptor pairs with the highest likelihood of influencing Alzheimer's were examined more closely.\n\nOne of the relevant metabolites, agmatine, is thought to protect brain cells from inflammation-associated damage. The analysis revealed that agmatine was most likely to interact with a receptor known as CA3R.\n\nFurther investigation indicated that agmatine and CA3R do influence one another.\n\nAlzheimer's-affected neurons treated with agmatine reduced CA3R levels, while agmatine-treated neurons also demonstrated significantly lower levels of phosphorylated tau proteins - known markers of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nThe researchers underscored that this work highlights the potential for AI applications in other studies assessing the link between the gut microbiome and disease.\n\n\"We specifically focused on Alzheimer's disease, but metabolite-receptor interactions play a role in almost every disease that involves gut microbes,\" Cheng stated. \"We hope that our methods can provide a framework to progress the entire field of metabolite-associated diseases and human health.\"", "source": {"uri": "healthitanalytics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HealthITAnalytics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shania_kennedy@healthitanalytics.com", "name": "Shania Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Receptor (biochemistry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein\u2013protein_interaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Protein\u2013protein interaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Metabolite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microorganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microorganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Clinic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Clinic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gut_microbiota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gut microbiota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agmatine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agmatine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parkinson's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Physiology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proteomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tau protein"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Neurobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Neurobiology", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://healthitanalytics.com/images/site/article_headers/_normal/2021-03-05-GettyImages-474772731.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

This substance clumps together, forming plaques that disrupt brain function.\n\nHowever, a newer theory is gaining traction, suggesting that the root of the problem may lie in metabolic dysfunction, particularly within the mitochondria. These are the components of cells that generate most of the chemical energy needed to power the cell's biochemical reactions.\n\nThis latest study provides compelling evidence supporting the metabolic dysfunction theory. The research team observed metabolic abnormalities in their models long before any significant increase in amyloid-beta protein was detectable.\n\nThese early findings suggest that addressing metabolic issues could be key to preventing or treating Alzheimer's.\n\nTo investigate these metabolic changes, researchers used a tiny worm known as Caenorhabditis elegans. This worm is a favorite among scientists because, despite its simplicity, it shares many molecular characteristics with humans, making it an excellent model for studying human diseases.\n\nAn exciting development in the study was the discovery that Metformin, a common medication for diabetes, could reverse these metabolic defects in the worms.\n\nTreating the worms with Metformin not only normalized their metabolic functions but also extended their typical healthspan and lifespan.\n\nThe implications of these findings are significant. They suggest that tackling mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunctions directly and early might be a more effective strategy than waiting for symptoms to appear.\n\nThis approach aligns with the broader view that conditions like Alzheimer's are not isolated diseases but rather manifestations of the broader process of aging.\n\nUnderstanding metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunctions as fundamental aspects of aging can shift how we approach age-related diseases.\n\nRather than targeting the specific diseases after they have developed, it might be more beneficial to focus on the underlying mechanisms of aging itself.\n\nThis preventive strategy could potentially change the way we handle not only Alzheimer's but also other age-dependent diseases, making early intervention a key focus.\n\nThe study, led by Jan Gruber and published in the scientific journal eLife, is a step forward in the fight against Alzheimer's.\n\nIt not only challenges some of the longstanding theories about the disease but also opens new avenues for research and treatment, emphasizing the importance of metabolic health in maintaining brain health as we age.\n\nThis breakthrough highlights the interconnected nature of our body's systems and reinforces the idea that a holistic approach may be crucial in tackling the complexities of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.\n\nIf you care about Alzheimer's, please read studies about the likely cause of Alzheimer's disease and new non-drug treatment that could help prevent Alzheimer's.\n\nFor more information about brain health, please see recent studies about diet that may help prevent Alzheimer's, and results showing some dementia cases could be prevented by changing these 12 things.", "source": {"uri": "knowridge.com",

The research published in Nature Medicine suggests that people who have two copies of a particular gene variant -- APOE4 -- are all but certain to develop the disease, reports the New York Times. Under the shift in thinking, such people wouldn't be merely warned that they have a high risk of developing the disease, they would be told that they have the disease -- a distinct form of it.\n\nThe consequences of such a change would be huge because between 2% and 3% of the nation's approximately 330 million people would be affected, per a release from the Saint Pau Research Institute in Spain. As the Times' Pam Belluck puts it, the \"new classification would make this type of Alzheimer's one of the most common genetic disorders in the world.\" Given those numbers, it could lead to an accelerated push to develop treatments, which currently do not exist for people with the double variant. In fact, the side effects of drugs such as Leqembi, which target amyloid plaques in the brain, can be particularly dangerous for such patients, the FDA warns.\n\nPatients in this camp typically develop have telltale biological markers by age 55, roughly 10 years earlier than those with other forms of Alzheimer's. So should people in their 40s and younger rush out to get tested? A Stanford neurologist not involved with the study advises against it -- because of the lack of current treatments. \"My recommendation is if you don't have symptoms, you should definitely not figure out your APOE status,\" Dr. Michael Greicius tells the Times. \"It will only cause grief at this point.\" (More Alzheimer's disease stories.)", "source": {"uri": "newser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newser"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_johnson@newser.com", "name": "John Johnson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nature Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetic disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_plaques", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid plaques"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://img1-azrcdn.newser.com/image/1533376-12-20240506133147.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

And for me, passionately advocating for immunizations is an act of the greatest compassion.\n\nI have worked in day cares as a caregiver, as a nurse in pediatrician offices, the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, and now at the Roanoke City Health Department. I've witnessed, first-hand, patient outcomes that were debilitating and devastating. Outcomes that possibly could have been improved or even entirely avoided with a simple vaccination. It is heartbreaking to watch anyone suffer, but it is especially so when the suffering is easily preventable.\n\nEven as a child, I knew how important it was to get vaccinated. Growing up in rural Appalachia, my great-grandmother would tell me stories about her two little brothers who died from whooping cough, almost losing her own life to it as well. She laid flowers on their graves every year until she passed herself at age 94.\n\nAll of these experiences culminated in me becoming a champion of immunizations in both my professional and personal life. Frequently combating the onslaught of information, as well as parsing misinformation, can be daunting. I stand resolutely on the side of science and reason.\n\nVaccines are safe, effective, and have saved innumerable lives over the past 200-plus years.\n\nNow, as a Public Health Nurse and the Immunization Action Plan Coordinator for Roanoke City, I get to be a direct contributor to the health of our community. I want to safeguard the health of citizens of Roanoke and beyond by helping stop the spread of many diseases through vaccination. Going out and being directly involved in caring for the public brings me immense joy. One of favorite things about being a nurse is that I can combine my passion with compassion.\n\nBy getting immunized, you're not only protecting your health, but our community's health at large. I hope that you will join me in keeping you and your family's vaccinations up-to-date.\n\nBethany Hammond,\n\nRoanoke, Roanoke City and Alleghany Health Districts\n\nAs an Alzheimer's Association advocate, it is my honor to raise my voice on its behalf.\n\nI recently attended the 2024 AIM Advocacy Forum with my fellow Alzheimer's Association advocates from across the country.\n\nWe met with Congressman Morgan Griffith's staff on Capitol Hill to call for support for the NAPA Reauthorization Act which will extend work to ensure the Nation continues to prioritize addressing Alzheimer's and other dementias. Also, the BOLD Reauthorization Act which continues to strengthen the Alzheimer's public health infrastructure, empowering public health departments in communities throughout the nation to implement dementia interventions such as increasing early detection and diagnosis, reducing risk and supporting the needs of caregivers.\n\nWe asked for an additional $318 million for Alzheimer's research activities at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and $35 million for implementation of the BOLD Act at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nWe also asked for support of the Accelerating Access to Dementia & Alzheimer's Provider Training (AADAPT) Act, which will empower primary care providers to better diagnose Alzheimer's and other dementias.\n\nThank you, Congressman Griffith, for listening to those of us impacted by Alzheimer's and for your continued support.\n\nPlease join me and the Alzheimer's Association in encouraging Congressman Griffth to advance policies that will continue making progress in the fight against Alzheimer's and all other dementia.\n\nTo learn more about this disease and how you can join the fight to end Alzheimer's, visit alzimpact.org.\n\nMargie Campbell Shaver, Roanoke\n\nEach year, Operation Christmas Child reaches out to share God's love with children around the world who may be in difficult circumstances, sometimes due to poverty or war.\n\nSimple shoeboxes filled with toys, school supplies and hygiene items are packed by volunteers and transported to various needy areas throughout the year.\n\nIn 2023, more than 13,000 shoebox gifts were provided by churches, student groups and organizations in the counties of Alleghany, Botetourt, Craig, Roanoke and the cities of Roanoke and Salem.

Although it has been known for some time that APOE4 homozygosity confers a very high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease4,5,6 (with an odds ratio greater than 12), there has been a lack of detailed studies in large cohorts of APOE4 homozygotes to faithfully determine the role of this genotype in Alzheimer's disease development. In this issue of Nature Medicine, Fortea et al.7 provide comprehensive evidence to support the reconceptualization of APOE4 homozygosity as a form of genetically determined Alzheimer's disease, like ADAD and DSAD (Fig. 1).\n\nThe authors analysed a large pathological dataset from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center in the USA (N = 3,297, including 273 APOE4 homozygotes) and five other clinical datasets from multicenter cohorts with Alzheimer's disease biomarker data from three countries (N = 10,039, including 519 APOE4 homozygotes). They show that across both sexes, APOE4 homozygotes fulfill the three main characteristics that define a genetic form of Alzheimer's disease -- that is, a near-full penetrance, predictability of the age of symptom onset, and a predictable sequence of biomarker changes (Fig. 1). Notably, the predictability of symptom onset (occurring at 65.1 years, with a 95% prediction interval of 48.5-81.5 years) and the sequence of biomarker changes in APOE4 homozygotes are very similar to those of the ADAD and DSAD groups. The authors conclude that Alzheimer's disease in APOE4 homozygotes should be redefined as a genetic form of the disease, similar to ADAD and DSAD. Additionally, through further examination of APOE3/APOE4 heterozygotes, the authors confirmed an autosomal semi-dominant effect of APOE4 (as reported previously), revealing a distinct APOE4 gene dosage effect on the pathology, symptom onset and sequence of biomarker changes, with APOE4 heterozygotes consistently showing intermediate outcomes compared with APOE4 and APOE3 homozygotes.", "source": {"uri": "nature.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nature"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zygosity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zygosity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomarker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomarker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cohort study"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odds ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_dosage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene dosage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penetrance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autosome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autosome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(genetics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dominance (genetics)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Genitourinary_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Genitourinary Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_DisordersGenetic", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic DisordersGenetic", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41591-024-02923-w/MediaObjects/41591_2024_2923_Fig1_HTML.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

But a letter their mother wrote almost 40 years ago could hold the key to changing the course of the future for their family and thousands of others.\"You know you tend to get older people and they're buying a pair of shoes and they're like, 'Those will see me out'. I've basically always had that attitude,\" says 39-year-old John Jennings. \"I'm like, 'Shall I buy a new laptop?' - because I've had Macs that have lasted 10 years in the past.\"John, who lives in Edinburgh with his husband Matt, is not bothered by material possessions because he doesn't know if he has inherited a faulty gene from his mother that could trigger early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.\"I've just found that the thing that makes me happiest is being around people who love me,\" he says. \"So we just spend a lot of time building relationships and that seems to be the most fulfilling part of life.\"But these social connections are the things John is most scared of losing if he does have the gene mutation and goes on to develop the condition in his 50s, like his mother Carol did.\"I'm trying to learn loads of languages and I'm obsessively exercising, I know for most people that would dramatically reduce my risk of getting Alzheimer's,\" says John, \"but the fact of the matter is, for me, it doesn't make any difference.\" For the majority of people, advancing age is the biggest risk factor in Alzheimer's. In every 100 people with the condition, less than 1% will have the inherited form.Jennings familyIn the 1980s, it was widely thought Alzheimer's Disease had no familial link, but when John's grandfather - Carol's dad - and his four siblings were all diagnosed with the condition in their 50s, Carol knew this couldn't be a coincidence.A new documentary for BBC Two tells the story of how Carol, a teacher from Coventry, helped change the face of Alzheimer's Disease research with one handwritten letter. She had always tried to find solutions to problems, says John, it was \"her way of getting some control of the situation\". In 1986, Carol wrote to a team at University College London (UCL) who were studying the disease. By analysing the genetics of her family, the team identified a gene in 1991 that all her affected family members shared. A mutation to the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene meant too much amyloid protein built up in the brain, which clumps together to form plaques and causes brain cells to die.Carol passed down a 50% chance to John and his older sister Emily, 42, of inheriting the gene mutation that triggers early-onset Alzheimer's Disease.\"If someone has the gene, they will develop disease at around the same time that their family members did,\" says consultant neurologist, Dr Cath Mummery, head of clinical trials at the Dementia Research Centre, at UCL. \"So they are aware of the ticking time bomb, especially as they near that age.\"Jennings family\"It's tempting to think if I discovered that I had it, that Emily didn't, and vice versa,\" says John. \"But it could be that both of us do. It could be that neither of us do.\"For those at risk of genetic Alzheimer's Disease, a blood test can be taken - after specialist consultation and counselling - to show if the genetic abnormality that causes the disease is present. John's mother Carol chose not to take the test, as she believed there was no point in worrying, says John, but while he respects his mother's choice, it's not the route he wants to go down. \"We could have planned better if we knew that she had,\" says John. Jennings familyHe was 21 when his mother first started showing symptoms in the mid-2000s. Her condition slowly deteriorated until she became bedbound and couldn't speak. Every stage of his mother's decline was \"like a new tonne of bricks that you have to deal with\", he says.Carol passed away in March this year. She asked for her brain to be donated for scientific research.John says he will definitely take the blood test at some point - it's just when - and he will decide on the timing with his sister. Now, is not the time. \"I think if one of us had the test then the other one would probably follow pretty quickly afterwards,\" says John. \"So it almost feels like it's a decision we need to make together.\"Jennings familyThe one thing that might bring forward John's decision to take the test would be if he needs to know his gene status to start any medical treatment.He is optimistic about new Alzheimer's drugs that c ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early-onset_Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Early-onset Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edinburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid-beta_precursor_protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid-beta precursor protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCL_Queen_Square_Institute_of_Neurology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blood test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neurology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychotherapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychotherapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Teen_Pregnancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Teen Pregnancy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Intersexed", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Intersexed", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 79}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Three decades ago their family became the world 's first to be diagnosed with hereditary Alzheimer's. The discovery came after their mother Carol persuaded doctors to investigate after seeing the disease destroy her father and four of his siblings.\n\nNow she herself has passed from Alzheimer's at 70 and her children have a 50/50 chance of going the same way. They are the subjects of a BBC Two documentary which tells how Carol made global headlines by working with doctors to improve understanding of the disease and enabling them to develop a genetic test. The former teacher wrote to Sir John Hardy, a professor at University College London, convincing him the disease could have a hereditary form.\n\nThe couple with John as a baby The family relax at home\n\nThis was identified in 1990 after four years of research. Carol had acted after her father, uncle and aunt all developed the disease in their 50s. Her instincts were further confirmed when research found the familial form of the disease can strike far earlier and harder.\n\nShe started having symptoms aged 58 in 2012 and passed away this Easter shortly after turning 70 - donating her brain to medical science. While Alzheimer's remains incurable, early diagnosis means drugs can help stem the onset and decline. Using archive home movies, diaries and photographs, the 60-minute film - called The Jennings v Alzheimer's - captures the heartache of watching loved ones with the disease decline.\n\nCarol, who was born in Nottingham and later moved to Coventry, is shown as a child, as a younger woman, and with her husband of 44 years, Stuart, 67, a retired clergyman, daughter Emily, 42, and son John, 39, at home and on holiday. Before the disease hit, she toured the world giving speeches about Alzheimer's at medical conferences. In stark contrast, there are scenes showing her in bed, unable to speak or recognise her family.\n\n\"Mum was so endlessly optimistic,\" says John. \"She always found solutions. She was so supportive and I am so lucky to have had her. She was always there for me. But shortly after she got the official diagnosis, her personality started to change and she wouldn't always remember everything. It was really tough and both Emily and I felt we lost her a long time ago when she didn't know who we were, when she wasn't able to speak.\"\n\nBoth he and Emily, who has an eight-year-old daughter, may get tested to see if they have the disease. And John would consider voluntary euthanasia at Dignitas in Switzerland. \"I want to have a genetic test pretty soon to find out whether I have it or not,\" he says. \"It's not that I would want to change anything. I am very happy. I have got a lovely life but I would like to be able to plan my options. If we are going to have a test then we will both have it. If one finds they have it, and the other doesn't, then you will need to deal with a lot of emotion.\"\n\nJohn and dad Stuart Carol and Stuart made a vow to each other\n\nDoctors recently revealed the development of two drugs - lecanemab and donanemab - that could slow symptoms down, although they are not yet licensed in the UK. John is watching their progress with interest but says he would\n\nrather take matters into his own hands if all other options fail.\n\nHe says: \"I can't bear the thought of years and years of being totally reliant on carers. I want to have control. I am not suggesting this for everyone else or saying Mum was ever a burden but, for me, it feels like I would be a burden to put that much expectation on other people. Now there are drugs on the horizon. I am very keen to be on the drugs. They may not stop it but they may give me more time and control. If I had complete control, I would already be on the drugs, as we know it (Alzheimer's) starts to build up 10 to 15 years before you get symptoms.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I can't envisage myself getting old because I'm convinced I have Alzheimer's. I'm totally convinced that in 10 years' time I will lose those connections (with my loved ones) like a television going static.\" The family agreed to make the BBC documentary to keep Carol's legacy alive and let the world know about her campaigning. She watched the penultimate edit with her family before she passed away.\n\n\"How much she actually knew what was going on, I am not sure,\" says husband Stuart. \"But she was there with us when it got shown so she would have got to hear it.I am so proud of Carol. She was remarkable. She was always a vivacious person and when she watched her family develop it (the disease), it really gave her a whole new focus in life. That was powerful to see.\" Recalling his wife's later years, Stuart says she dealt with her own Alzheimer's with \"courage and grace\".\n\nHe adds: \"She went from being an independent, very vivacious person to being dependent on me, John, and Emily. But she was so brave about it. For me, it was a privilege to nurse her and, whilst her death has left a big hole in my life, I promised Carol I would continue the work. It's something we shared together. She said, 'If I can't speak, can you speak for me?' And that's what I now want to continue to do.\"\n\nThe Jennings v Alzheimer's is on BBC Two on Monday, May 13, at 9pm", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christine_smith@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Christine Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hardy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Hardy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University College London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genetic testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diagnosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_euthanasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voluntary euthanasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coventry", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Coventry"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nottingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nottingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caregiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32722055.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_new-exclusive-social-copy.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-13", "textStart": 5436, "textEnd": 5442}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Nowadays, amalgam fillings are rarely used in dental offices in the UK; instead, mercury-free substitutes like ceramic or composite fillings are frequently used.\n\nFurthermore, within the past 20 years, a number of European nations, including Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and France, have either outlawed or severely limited the use of mercury fillings.\n\nHow can people effectively safeguard themselves from the possible health effects of this connection?\n\nWhen it comes to decreasing the likelihood of Porphyromonas gingivalis bacteria forming within mouth cavities, prevention is crucial. \"Patients should regularly see their dentists for check-ups and hygiene visits, to stay on top of treatments and avoid any worsening of the condition by reducing the bacterial count,\" advised Doctor Smita.\n\nIn order to learn how to assist with maintaining oral hygiene at home and to report any dental problems or symptoms they may have observed the patient experiencing, a chaperone or family member should accompany Alzheimer's patients in more advanced stages of the disease, according to the expert.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The vast majority of Alzheimer's cases occur after age 65. But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk.

The vast majority of Alzheimer's cases occur after age 65. But research published Monday suggests that for people who carry not one but two copies of the gene, it's more than a risk factor, it's an underlying cause of the mind-robbing disease.\n\nThe findings mark a distinction with \"profound implications,\" said Dr. Juan Fortea, who led the study the Sant Pau Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAmong them: Symptoms can begin seven to 10 years sooner than in other older adults who develop Alzheimer's.\n\nWatch here: New drugs show small but positive results in fight against Alzheimer's\n\nAn estimated 15 percent of Alzheimer's patients carry two copies of APOE4, meaning those cases \"can be tracked back to a cause and the cause is in the genes,\" Fortea said. Until now, genetic forms of Alzheimer's were thought to be only types that strike at much younger ages and account for less than 1 percent of all cases.\n\nScientists say the research makes it critical to develop treatments that target the APOE4 gene. Some doctors won't offer the only drug that has been shown to modestly slow the disease, Leqembi, to people with the gene pair because they're especially prone to a dangerous side effect, said Dr. Reisa Sperling, a study coauthor at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\n\nSperling hunts ways to prevent or at least delay Alzheimer's and \"this data for me says wow, what an important group to be able to go after before they become symptomatic.\"\n\nBut the news doesn't mean people should race for a gene test. \"It's important not to scare everyone who has a family history\" of Alzheimer's because this gene duo isn't behind most cases, she told The Associated Press.\n\n<h2> How do genetics affect Alzheimer's? </h2>\n\nMore than 6 million Americans, and millions more worldwide, have Alzheimer's. A handful of genes are known to cause rare \"early-onset\" forms, mutations passed through families that trigger symptoms unusually young, by age 50. Some cases also are linked to Down syndrome.\n\nBut Alzheimer's most commonly strikes after 65, especially in the late 70s to 80s, and the APOE gene - which also affects how the body handles fats -- was long known to play some role. There are three main varieties. Most people carry the APOE3 variant that appears to neither increase nor decrease Alzheimer's risk. Some carry APOE2, which provides some protection against Alzheimer's.\n\nAPOE4 has long been labeled the biggest genetic risk factor for late-in-life Alzheimer's, with two copies risker than one. About 2 percent of the global population is estimated to have inherited a copy from each parent.\n\n<h2> Research points to a cause for a subset of Alzheimer's </h2>\n\nTo better understand the gene's role, Fortea's team used data from 3,297 brains donated for research and from over 10,000 people in U.S. and European Alzheimer's studies.

Sperling said the people most likely to carry two APOE4 genes had parents who both got Alzheimer's relatively early, in their 60s rather than 80s.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "lauran_neergaard@pbs.org", "name": "Lauran Neergaard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolipoprotein_E", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apolipoprotein E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer's_disease", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alzheimer's disease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Risk factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_on_Aging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Institute on Aging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amyloid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigham_and_Women's_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brigham and Women's Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genealogy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genealogy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Down syndrome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cerebral edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Neuroimaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(journal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nature (journal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White people"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Blood_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Blood Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Neurological_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Neurological Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Genetics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Nutritional_and_Metabolic_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Nutritional and Metabolic Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2024/05/alzhmeirs-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9536916", "eventUri": "eng-9536916", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 452726226, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 74, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 74}}}

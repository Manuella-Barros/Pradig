Wouldn\u2019t it also be nice if you didn\u2019t hesitate to ask? Many people, no matter what their rank in an organization, hesitate to ask for help, even from long-time colleagues and friends. They don\u2019t want to be bothersome or give the impression that they can\u2019t take care of things on their own. Who wants that? If I\u2019m describing you, you\u2019re probably doing yourself and your colleagues a disservice. Led by social psychology professor Yu Niiya, associate editor of the Japanese Journal of Social Psychology, researchers at Tokyo\u2019s Hosei University have found that co-workers like to be asked to help. It increases their sense of self-worth and creates a bond between the person who offers the help and the individual asking for it. There are risks involved, of course\u2014asking a favor obviously places a burden on someone else and if you\u2019re turned down it can create resentment as well. But the benefits, \u201cproviding opportunities \u2026 to build and promote relationships,\u201d appear to outweigh the risks, the study found. So, lesson number one: \u00b7 If you need a second-opinion or a helping hand, ask someone. Perhaps more important than whether or not you should ask for a favor (You should!) is the best way to ask. How best to ask a favor is something we\u2019ve studied closely. The Japanese researchers answered the question broadly: when asked by a colleague for help, study participants indicated that receiving a \u201cdirect request\u201d for assistance not only led them to respond, but increased their affinity for the colleague who asked. The lesson: \u00b7 If you want to be liked at work, consider asking colleagues for favors on occasion. Don\u2019t beat around the bush; ask directly. [Hint: But don\u2019t make a habit of it. Then you become a burden, a pest. Also, be realistic.] With the exception of the company curmudgeon, most of us would rather be liked by our work colleagues than unliked. But that\u2019s not why we typically ask colleagues to help us out. We ask for help because we need it. We need them to say \u201cSure, glad to ...\u201d MORE FOR YOU Trump Trial Prosecutor Ends Closing Argument After Nearly 5 Hours Jury Instructions Set For Wednesday Gas Explosion In Downtown Youngstown Ohio Injures At Least 7 Take Advantage Of The Best Memorial Day Laptop Sales Still Live What\u2019s the best way to encourage that? The generic answer is to make a \u201cdirect request,\u201d using the terminology the Japanese researchers employed. But what kind of direct request? A Harvard Business Review article asked (and answered) that exact question a couple of years ago: \u201cWhen you need help with something, do you send an email, make [a] call, schedule a Zoom [meeting], or ask in person?\u201d As the authors pointed out later in their article, how you make a request \u2014\u201cthe mode of communication\u201d\u2014can have a significant bearing on the response you get. BCG\u2019s Behavioral Science Lab has taken a deep dive into this topic. And though we don\u2019t have a magic wand that can put people under your spell, the data we collected might help you achieve the \u201cSure\u201d you\u2019re looking for the next time you need to ask a favor. There are several big considerations when you make an ask: 1) the nature of the request (Is this something big and/or urgent?); 2) your relationship with the person you\u2019re asking (How well do you know this colleague and are you higher, lower, or equal in the pecking order?), and 3) the medium, or mode of communication, most likely to trigger the desired outcome (Should I ask in person, or is a phone call or an email request okay?). Before we conducted our in-house study, my colleagues and I almost unanimously would have guessed that an in-person, face-to-face request always would produce the best outcome. We would have guessed wrong. According to our data, personal phone calls are more effective, even among younger colleagues (producing a 47% positive response rate, 3% higher than in-person requests). My theory is: It\u2019s probably because phone conversations are less intimidating. When someone standing face-to-face with you asks you to do a favor, you may feel pressured\u2014and your defense mechanism might trigger you to invent an excuse for why you can\u2019t help, when you might have said \u201cyes\u201d if you were having a friendly phone conversation. The other modes we looked at\u2014sending an email note, sending a handwritten note, and sending a typed-out written request\u2014produced lower results. More-senior people are more willing to tackle the \u201cbig\u201d asks, those of lower rank are more likely to do mildly challenging favors, and small favors are what we call \u201ctenure indifferent.\u201d It should go without saying that asking a favor is different than giving an order. So always be conscious of your tone, regardless of whom you\u2019re addressing. It, too, can make a big difference.

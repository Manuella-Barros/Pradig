Both the Ravens' 2021 and 2022 seasons spiraled into futility after late-season injuries for Jackson. However, he managed to stay healthy last season and they reached the conference finals for the first time since 2012.\n\nOne might think that putting on more muscle would increase Jackson's durability, and it sounds plausible in theory. The past three seasons haven't indicated as much, however. He played at his heaviest in 2021 and 2022 before dropping weight last season. Now he's at the lightest of his career.\n\nJackson recently participated in a Complex Sports segment in which he responded to Tweets. Responding to one user who said that Jackson was \"2019 MVP thin\" now and that it \"may get spooky\", he confirmed the weight loss.\n\n\"Most definitely\", he said, as transcribed by Charean Williams for Pro Football Talk. \"I was 230 two years ago. I was 215 last season, but now I'm like 205\". Jackson entered the league weighing 216 pounds at the 2018 NFL Scouting Combine, and largely maintained that weight. He decided to add weight to \"see how it feels\" in 2022, but has trended in the opposite direction since.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Complex Sports (@complexsports)\n\nJackson says he's 25 pounds lighter than the weight at which he played just two seasons ago. To be clear, he hasn't said that 205 is his intended playing weight for this season. He may add another 10 pounds or so by the start of the season, so we'll have to see how that develops.\n\nThe Ravens had their most successful season under Jackson last year by advancing to the conference finals. He won his second MVP Award, even without gaudy numbers, as well. Boosted by a 13-3 record, he went 307-for-457 passing for 3,678 yards with 24 touchdowns to 7 interceptions. He also rushed for 821 yards with five more touchdowns, though he fumbled 11 times.\n\nJackson owns a career 58-19 record as a starting quarterback since the Ravens drafted him in 2018. He's twice won 13 games in a single season as a starter, the two years he won the MVP Award. The Ravens rested him in the regular-season finale on both occasions, but back in 2019, they went one-and-done in the playoffs. This time they managed to win a game, now 2-4 with Jackson (and 2-5 since drafting Jackson).\n\nIf Lamar Jackson really intends to play at 205 this season, how will that affect his game, and the Ravens'? They spent money in free agency to add DB Derrick Henry, so perhaps they want to take some carries off his plate. They've tried it before, but they never had such a reliable running back before.\n\nThe Ravens parted with offensive coordinator Greg Roman last year in part to focus more on the passing game. They need to take that next step this year under Todd Monken, and playing at a lighter weight will only increase Jackson's off-script capabilities.\n\nRelated Items:Baltimore Ravens, Lamar Jackson Recommended for you Steelers-Ravens Left Off List Of NFL's Top Rivalries Harbaugh: Ravens G Andrew Vorhees 'Looked Like You'd Expect Him To Look' First Time Practicing Jaylen Warren Happy Patrick Queen Is A Steeler After Battles Last Two Years", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_marczi@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Matthew Marczi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Vorhees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Vorhees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Queen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Monken", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Monken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Roman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Roman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lamar-Jackson-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555149", "eventUri": "eng-9555149", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

According to Jackson's teammate, tight end Isaiah Likely, the 27-year-old has trimmed so much weight that he wasn't recognizable at first glance.\n\nSpeaking with Kay Adams on FanDuel's \"Up & Adams\" show, Likely stated that he didn't even recognize Jackson when he first met with the two-time league MVP following the latter's weight loss:\n\n\"He said he was like 230-235 (pounds)...Now, he's slimmed. The first time I seen L...I'm walking and looking up and I'm like 'Who is that...ain't no way'. And he's like, 'Man, I'm good now..I'm back'...I'm just gonna say...y'all thought L was fast before...\"\n\nLikely's story caused Adams to express (humorous) concern. She's a well-known Cincinnati Bengals fan, and her team has struggled mightily against Jackson since he turned professional in 2018.\n\nJackson revealed earlier this offseason that he is down to 205 pounds. That's indeed a scary thought for the rest of the NFL, seeing how he just won his second MVP award while also guiding Baltimore to its first AFC Championship Game appearance in 11 years.\n\nAlso Read: New Schedule Predictions Suggest The AFC North Could Be in For A Rough 2024 Season\n\nA string of injuries limited Jackson to 12 games in both the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Fortunately, he stayed healthy last season and set career-highs in completion percentage (67.2) and passing yards (3,678). Jackson had 24 passing touchdowns against only seven interceptions to go along with 821 rushing yards and five touchdowns.\n\nLamar Jackson & Ravens Are Set Up For A Super Bowl Run\n\nThe Ravens' AFC Championship Game defeat at the hands of the Kansas City Chiefs was tough to stomach, no doubt. But it was also a step in the right direction for a team that entered 2023 with just one postseason victory in the Lamar Jackson era.\n\nBaltimore still has the makings of a top-five offense and defense, so they'll once again be in the mix for the Lombardi Trophy in 2023.

Patrick Mahomes has Andy Reid's fantastic playbook and play-calling. Lots of other quarterbacks have better offensive weapons. Jackson has always been the focal point of his offense; more than any quarterback in the NFL, Jackson is asked to do more with less every week he plays. And he does.\n\nBecause of Jackson's athleticism, special and underrated arm talent, and unique running ability, Jackson has been the entire Ravens offense since his first year starting in 2019. The run game is built around him and his top target has consistently been a tight end with no dominant outside wide receivers.\n\nMany hoped change would start when the Ravens brought in new offensive coordinator Todd Monken from Georgia, who led with a dominant offense to win back-to-back NCAA championships, and drafted wide receiver Zay Flowers and signed Odell Beckham Jr. A lot did seem to change. Flowers had the best rookie receiver year in franchise history, Beckham was a steady vet presence despite his lack of stats and the Ravens offense simply looked different than the previous years with offensive coordinator Greg Roman.\n\nBut even then, it wasn't all smooth sailing. Monken did an interview with the podcast \"Coaches and the Mouth\" before the NFL Combine released on May 3. He was asked about what goes into game planning once you get to the red zone. Monken talked about how the Ravens struggled early and relied on Jackson too much in that area.\n\n... when you've got the athletic in the red zone, it gives you an extra tool. You don't have to go wild cat, you've got the wild cat quarterback, that adds an extra element. That's [only] a part, we were using that way too much early in the year. We went to London and played the Titans there and we kicked a [ton] of field goals, like we got down [in the red zone], we use Lamar too much.\n\nThis is had been a common theme during Jackson's time in the NFL. Each year since Jackson took over as the starter in 2019, Jackson has been the leading rusher for the Ravens, even in 2021 and 2022 when he missed games due to injury. Monken goes on to describe head coach John Harbaugh's feelings on the matter.\n\n... and coach [Harbaugh] is like 'guys like that isn't good enough, that can't be us, we just rely on Lamar, we gotta be better than that' and we were doing some of these other things well.\n\nHarbaugh has never been shy on saying the Ravens aren't worried about Jackson's running. Last year he did say while certain run plays may not be called as often, Jackson's run ability would still be a big part of what the Ravens do offensively and would remain in the playbook. So, to hear that he possibly got a fired up about not relying so much on Jackson behind closed doors after a big win in London is a new perspective and good to hear.\n\nMonken continues, talking about what the next steps were after that conversation.\n\nWhat's our job? Our job is to fix it. That's what every assistant coach is to do if the head coach says something, you fight like hell to fix it. If you're a position coach, you fight like hell to fix it. So what we became...how are we more creative? Do we need to go fast, do we need to go speed break, do we need to go unbalanced? How do we get seam throws, what is Lamar good at, right? What are we doing when it comes to run-pass ratio, what are the best teams doing? What is that that we needed to do to get a hell of a lot better not rely on Lamar solely? And from then on, we ended up being in the top five in scoring touchdowns in the Red Zone after that week.\n\nIt's great to hear the questions that were asked and the effort put in after the coaching staff wasn't happy with the process despite the results of a win.\n\nGoing into the 2024 season, Ravens fans can expect more. Monken and Jackson are going into year two together as offensive coordinator and Jackson should have a massive role in building the offense this year. Flowers is going into year two of his young career. Everybody in the Ravens brass expects a massive leap out of wide receiver Rashod Bateman, who just finished his first healthy season in 2023 and should build going into another. Not to mention, for the first time in his career, there might be a bigger running threat than Jackson on the team with the addition of running back Derrick Henry.", "source": {"uri": "baltimorebeatdown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Baltimore Beatdown"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_canter@baltimorebeatdown.com", "name": "Zach Canter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Monken", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Monken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jackson, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red zone (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zay_Flowers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zay Flowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odell_Beckham_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odell Beckham Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Roman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greg Roman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Scouting_Combine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Scouting Combine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashod_Bateman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rashod Bateman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_Henry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick Henry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yyf5dDTQoAevbdf8jeeLB8Mubxw=/0x97:4719x2457/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25437324/1728207857.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9555149", "eventUri": "eng-9555149", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1399, "textEnd": 1404}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

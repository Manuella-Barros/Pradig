Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the celebrity chef and philanthropist behind the Washington-based World Central Kitchen disaster relief group, is expected to speak at the celebration of life service, and famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma will perform, organisers said.\n\nThe Biden administration said Thursday that Douglas Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, and US Assistant Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell would be among senior administration figures attending.\n\nThe aid workers were killed April 1 when a succession of Israeli armed drones ripped through vehicles in their convoy as they left one of World Central Kitchen's warehouses on a food delivery mission. Those who died were Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha; Britons John Chapman, James Kirby and James Henderson; dual US-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger; Australian Lalzawmi Frankcom; and Polish citizen Damiam Sobol.\n\nAfter an unusually swift investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the strike had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended -- incorrectly -- showed one of the seven workers was armed. The Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.\n\nThe aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the six-month-old Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations. That includes at least 30 killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe international prominence and popularity of Andres and his nonprofit work galvanised widespread outrage over the killings of the World Central Kitchen workers. The slayings intensified demands from the Biden administration and others that Israel's military change how it operates in Gaza to spare aid workers and Palestinian civilians at large, who are facing a humanitarian crisis and desperately need aid from relief organisations as the UN warns of looming famine.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, along with several other humanitarian aid agencies, suspended work in Gaza after the attack. \"We haven't given up,\" World Central Kitchen spokesperson Linda Roth said last week. \"We are in funeral mode right now.\"\n\nReligious leaders of a range of faiths are set to participate in Thursday's services.

Those who died were Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha; Britons John Chapman, James Kirby and James Henderson; dual U.S.-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger; Australian Lalzawmi Frankcom; and Polish citizen Damiam Sobol.\n\nAfter an unusually swift investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the strike had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended -- incorrectly -- showed one of the seven workers was armed. The Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.\n\nThe aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the six-month-old Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations.

World Central Kitchen, the food charity founded by celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, called a halt to its work in the Gaza Strip after an Israeli strike killed seven of its workers, mostly foreigners.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The seven World Central Kitchen aid workers killed by Israeli airstrikes represented the \"best of humanity\" and risked everything \"to feed people they did not know and will never meet,\" Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the celebrity chef who founded the organization, told mourners who gathered Thursday to honor the dead.\n\nSpeaking at Washington National Cathedral, Andr\u00e9s said there was no excuse for the killings and he called for an investigation into the deaths. He appeared to struggle at times to maintain his composure, his words focused on the lives and contributions of the aid workers as he pleaded for greater compassion.\n\n\"The seven souls we mourn today were there so that hungry people could eat,\" said Andr\u00e9s, reading aloud their names. \"Their examples should inspire us to do better, to be better.\"\n\nThe workers were killed April 1 when strikes from Israeli armed drones ripped through vehicles in their convoy as they left one of World Central Kitchen's warehouses on a food delivery mission: Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha; Britons John Chapman, James Kirby and James Henderson; dual U.S.-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger; Australian Lalzawmi Frankcom; and Polish citizen Damiam Sobol.\n\nAndr\u00e9s spoke in depth about each one and their contributions to the work of feeding people suffering through disaster and deprivation -- human-made and natural -- around the world.\n\nHe said Abutaha was an integral member of the team who was very close to his family. He said Chapman was \"brave, selfless and strong\" and had the ability to make people around him feel \"loved and protected.\"\n\nAndr\u00e9s said Flickinger was a problem-solver, \"exactly what you need\" in the chaos of a disaster zone and Frankcom gave \"joy to others even more than she gave food.\"\n\nHe talked of how Henderson had taught first aid in Ukraine and was an avid rugby player. He said Kirby, known to friends as \"Kirbs,\" was driven to help people in need. And he said a town in Turkey had named a street after Sobol, in honor of his work there after an earthquake.\n\nAt times, Andr\u00e9s spoke emotionally about the organization's mission and why aid workers do what they do.\n\n\"We stand next to communities as they feed themselves, nourish themselves, heal themselves. People don't want our pity. They want our respect. Our only way to show respect is facing the mayhem alongside them,\" he said. \"We remind them by showing up that they are not alone in the darkness.\"\n\nAfter an unusually swift investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the attack had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended -- incorrectly -- showed one of the seven workers was armed. The Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.\n\n\"I know we all have many unanswered questions about what happened and why. There is no excuse for these killings,\" Andr\u00e9s told mourners, demanding an investigation. \"The official explanation is not good enough.\"\n\nThe aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the Israel-Hamas war that began Oct. 7, according to the United Nations.

He appeared to struggle at times to maintain his composure, his words focused on the lives and contributions of the aid workers as he pleaded for greater compassion.\n\n\"The seven souls we mourn today were there so that hungry people could eat,\" said Andr\u00e9s, reading aloud their names. \"Their examples should inspire us to do better, to be better.\"\n\nThe workers were killed April 1 when strikes from Israeli armed drones ripped through vehicles in their convoy as they left one of World Central Kitchen's warehouses on a food delivery mission: Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha; Britons John Chapman, James Kirby and James Henderson; dual U.S.-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger; Australian Lalzawmi Frankcom; and Polish citizen Damiam Sobol.\n\nAndr\u00e9s spoke in depth about each one and their contributions to the work of feeding people suffering through disaster and deprivation -- human-made and natural -- around the world.\n\nHe said Abutaha was an integral member of the team who was very close to his family. He said Chapman was \"brave, selfless and strong\" and had the ability to make people around him feel \"loved and protected.\"\n\nAndr\u00e9s said Flickinger was a problem-solver, \"exactly what you need\" in the chaos of a disaster zone and Frankcom gave \"joy to others even more than she gave food.\"\n\nHe talked of how Henderson had taught first aid in Ukraine and was an avid rugby player. He said Kirby, known to friends as \"Kirbs,\" was driven to help people in need. And he said a town in Turkey had named a street after Sobol, in honor of his work there after an earthquake.\n\nAt times, Andr\u00e9s spoke emotionally about the organization's mission and why aid workers do what they do.\n\n\"We stand next to communities as they feed themselves, nourish themselves, heal themselves. People don't want our pity. They want our respect. Our only way to show respect is facing the mayhem alongside them,\" he said. \"We remind them by showing up that they are not alone in the darkness.\"\n\nAfter an unusually swift investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the attack had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended -- incorrectly -- showed one of the seven workers was armed. The Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.\n\n\"I know we all have many unanswered questions about what happened and why. There is no excuse for these killings,\" Andr\u00e9s told mourners, demanding an investigation. \"The official explanation is not good enough.\"\n\nThe aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the Israel-Hamas war that began Oct. 7, according to the United Nations. That includes at least 30 killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe international prominence and popularity of Andr\u00e9s and his nonprofit work galvanized widespread outrage over the killings of the group's workers.

Israel, has however, not taken responsibility for the deaths of the people whose bodies are in the graves.\n\nThe calls come as a memorial to honour aid workers from charity World Central Kitchen who were killed in an Israeli airstrike on 1 April is to be held at the National Cathedral in Washington today.\n\nIsrael appears to be preparing for a long-expected ground assault on Rafah, close to the Egyptian border, where more than one million refugees from other part of the territory have taken shelter.\n\nNational security advisor Jake Sullivan called for an investigation into the graves.\n\n\"We want answers,\" Mr Sullivan said. \"We want to see this thoroughly and transparently investigated.\"\n\nThe United Nations has launched its own investigation into the graves.\n\nHospitals have protection under international law, however, Israel's assault on Gaza has included a number of medical buildings, as it has claimed Hamas has been hiding members and weapons within hospital facilities.\n\nA staunch ally of Israel, the US has recently questioned Benjamin Netanyahu's government over its attacks on Gaza.\n\nEarlier this month, president Joe Biden called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" in Gaza, telling Mr Netanyahu that future US support for Israel will depend on it taking action to protect civilians.\n\nThe call between Mr Biden and Mr Netanyahu came shortly after the Israeli air strike killed aid workers from World Central Kitchen, including three British citizens.\n\nJose Andres, the celebrity chef and philanthropist behind the Washington-based World Central Kitchen disaster relief group, is expected to speak at the celebration of life service today, and famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma will perform.\n\nThose who died were Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha; Britons John Chapman, James Kirby and James Henderson; dual US-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger; Australian Lalzawmi Frankcom; and Polish citizen Damiam Sobol.\n\nFollowing an investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the strike had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended -- incorrectly -- showed one of the seven workers was armed.\n\nThe aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the six-month-old Israel-Hamas war, according to the United Nations.\n\nThat includes at least 30 killed in the line of duty.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, along with several other humanitarian aid agencies, suspended work in Gaza after the attack.\n\n\"We haven't given up,\" World Central Kitchen spokesperson Linda Roth said last week. \"We are in funeral mode right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In the worst moments, the best of humanity shows up.\"\n\nAndr\u00e9s honored the workers during an hourlong service at Washington, D.C.'s National Cathedral, a site where funerals and memorial services have been held for past presidents and Supreme Court justices. Second gentleman Doug Emhoff attended the memorial, representing the Biden administration.\n\nThe aid workers memorialized were: Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha of Palestine; John Chapman, James Henderson and James Kirby of Britain; Jacob Flickinger of the U.S. and Canada; Lalzawmi Frankcom of Australia and Damian Sob\u00f3l of Poland.\n\nAndr\u00e9s praised each worker during his remarks while taking a moment to pause and try to hold back tears while speaking about Frankcom, who he described as the \"heart of World Central Kitchen.\"\n\n\"Even one innocent life taken is one too many,\" the Spanish-born chef said. \"I know there are also many questions about why World Central Kitchen was in Gaza. We ask ourselves the same question day and night. We are all consumed with anger, regret and sorrow.\"\n\nOn April 1, the seven workers were killed in Gaza after an Israeli strike against a convoy from World Central Kitchen, an aid organization led by Andr\u00e9s that provides meals to civilians suffering from hunger due to conflicts.\n\nIsrael's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu admitted that an \"unintentional\" Israeli airstrike killed \"innocent people\" in Gaza, adding that \"we will do everything so that this thing does not happen again.\" Days later, the Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.\n\nThe attacks sparked worldwide condemnation from foreign leaders, with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying Israel is putting Poland's solidarity to a \"really hard test\" and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak telling Netanyahu that \"the situation is increasingly intolerable\" as aid workers continue to die in Gaza.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said he was \"outraged and heartbroken\" by the deadly airstrikes and demanded a \"swift\" investigation into the incident that \"would bring accountability.\"\n\nWorld Central Kitchen has paused its humanitarian efforts after the attack and called for an independent investigation. Nearly 200 humanitarian aid workers have been killed since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, according to the United Nations.\n\nAndr\u00e9s said Thursday that he expects world leaders to \"live by the same standards set by these seven heroes.\"\n\n\"Food can never be a weapon of war,\" he said. \"Humanitarians can never be targets because they are the best of us.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Central Kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_National_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington National Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Andr\u00e9s", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Tusk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Tusk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9511147", "eventUri": "eng-9511147", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 1473, "textEnd": 1480}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Organizers said 560 people attended -- a mix of World Central Kitchen staff and workers from other humanitarian organizations, U.S. government officials and diplomats from more than 30 nations.\n\nEach of the World Central Kitchen workers had been spurred to action in response to calamity -- a volcanic eruption, a war, an earthquake, Andr\u00e9s said.\n\nHis words faltered with emotion as he spoke of Frankcom.\n\n\"It always felt, from the start, that she embodied our spirit and purpose,\" he said. \"She gave joy to others, even more than she gave food. Dancing, singing, playing with children. .... Her compassion and curiosity were infectious.\"\n\nThe service's officiants included the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the cathedral's dean, and the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. Also speaking: Rabbi Susan N. Shankman, senior rabbi of the Washington Hebrew Congregation, and Imam Talib M. Shareef, imam and president of Masjid Muhammad, the Nation's Mosque in Washington.\n\nBehind the group stood the choir -- and behind them, flags representing the seven aid workers' homelands.\n\nThe workers were heroes, Andr\u00e9s said. He cited inspiration from John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath.\n\n\"Wherever there's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there,\" he said, referring to the famous speech by the character Tom Joad. \"The seven souls we mourn today were there, so that hungry people could eat.\"\n\nAttendees filled the main section of the cathedral's nave and its side transepts for the service, which included remembrances of the slain humanitarians, readings from Jewish, Muslim and Christian traditions and prayers for peace. Musicians performing include cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nThe gathering included second gentleman Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Harris, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell.\n\nAs of early April, at least 224 humanitarian workers had been killed in the Israel-Hamas war that began last October. According to the U.N. Security Council, the figure is \"more than three times as many humanitarian aid workers killed in any single conflict recorded in a single year.\"\n\n\"Our losses may seem small,\" Andr\u00e9s said, compared to other workers killed, the more than 34,000 Palestinians that the Gaza Ministry of Health says have died, and and some 1,200 Israelis killed by Hamas.\n\n\"But each of these people leave behind loved ones, who will always have them in their hearts,\" he added.\n\nIsrael has apologized for the attack that killed the seven workers, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying his country \"deeply regrets the tragic incident.\"\n\nThe Israeli military says the incident violated its protocols, punishing those responsible. But World Central Kitchen says that's not enough, calling for an independent investigation and noting Israel's acknowledgement that its aid team had followed established communications procedures.\n\n\"The root cause of the unjustified rocket fire on our convoy is the severe lack of food in Gaza,\" the charity said. \"Israel needs to dramatically increase the volume of food and medicine traveling by land if it is serious about supporting humanitarian aid.\"\n\nIn his remarks at the remembrance service, Andr\u00e9s said the world's leaders should be expected to live by the same standards set by the slain aid workers.\n\n\"When disaster strikes, it's easy to see the dark and never the light,\" he said. \"But the reality is this: The light will always shine through.\"\n\nIn a powerful moment in his speech, Andr\u00e9s asked all of the current and former World Central Kitchen workers at the service to stand up -- and as they did so, other attendees broke into loud and sustained applause.\n\nHe praised the workers for refusing to be indifferent to suffering, and insisting on helping others, even if it places them in great peril.\n\n\"The dishes we cook and deliver are not just ingredients, or calories,\" he said. \"A plate of food is a plate of hope. A message that someone, somewhere, cares for you.\"", "source": {"uri": "opb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "opb"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We still demand an investigation. We are all consumed with regret, anger and sorrow.\"\n\nA Catholic priest, a rabbi and an imam prayed and read scriptures, and the cathedral choir sang hymns.

After the attack, the World Central Kitchen suspended its operations in Gaza.\n\n\"Food is a universal human right,\" Mr Andres said. \"Eating and cooking food together is what makes us human.\"\n\n\"Food can never be a weapon of war. Humanitarians must never be targets.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has for months been urging Israel to enable the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza. It has also been trying to broker a ceasefire of at least six weeks during which hostages can be released and Palestinians can return to their homes.\n\nBut Mr Biden, who is running for re-election, has also been steadfast in his support for Israel.\n\nHis administration has provided military, political and diplomatic support for Israel during the war, now in its seventh month, even as the death toll continues to rise.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jihan_abdalla@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Jihan Abdalla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Central Kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Andr\u00e9s", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gothic Revival architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_National_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington National Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_dialogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interfaith dialogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philanthropy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philanthropy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Funeral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_M._Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt M.

He appeared to struggle at times to maintain his composure, his words focused on the lives and contributions of the aid workers as he pleaded for greater compassion.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

He said Chapman was \"brave, selfless and strong\" and had the ability to make people around him feel \"loved and protected.\"\n\nAndr\u00e9s said Flickinger was a problem-solver, \"exactly what you need\" in the chaos of a disaster zone and Frankcom gave \"joy to others even more than she gave food.\"\n\nHe talked of how Henderson had taught first aid in Ukraine and was an avid rugby player. He said Kirby, known to friends as \"Kirbs,\" was driven to help people in need. And he said a town in Turkey had named a street after Sobol, in honor of his work there after an earthquake.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAt times, Andr\u00e9s spoke emotionally about the organization's mission and why aid workers do what they do.\n\n\"We stand next to communities as they feed themselves, nourish themselves, heal themselves. People don't want our pity. They want our respect. Our only way to show respect is facing the mayhem alongside them,\" he said. \"We remind them by showing up that they are not alone in the darkness.\"\n\nAfter an unusually swift investigation, Israel said the military officials involved in the attack had violated policy by acting based on a single grainy photo that one officer had contended -- incorrectly -- showed one of the seven workers was armed. The Israeli military dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others.\n\n\"I know we all have many unanswered questions about what happened and why. There is no excuse for these killings,\" Andr\u00e9s told mourners, demanding an investigation. \"The official explanation is not good enough.\"\n\nThe aid workers, whose trip had been coordinated with Israeli officials, are among more than 220 humanitarian workers killed in the Israel-Hamas war that began Oct. 7, according to the United Nations. That includes at least 30 killed in the line of duty.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe international prominence and popularity of Andr\u00e9s and his nonprofit work galvanized widespread outrage over the killings of the group's workers. The deaths intensified demands from the administration and others that Israel's military change how it operates in Hamas-controlled Gaza to spare aid workers and Palestinian civilians in the territory who are facing a humanitarian crisis and desperately need aid from relief organizations as the U.N. warns of looming famine.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen, along with several other humanitarian aid agencies, suspended work in the territory after the attack. \"We haven't given up,\" World Central Kitchen spokesperson Linda Roth said last week. \"We are in funeral mode right now.\"\n\nDouglas Emhoff, husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, and Kurt Campbell, the deputy secretary of state, were among those at the event, joined by diplomats from more than 30 countries, along with representatives from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nDemocratic Sen.

On Thursday, the World Central Kitchen community convened to celebrate the seven aid workers, three weeks after they were killed by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nThe humanitarian workers are Palestinian Saifeddin \"Safi\" Issam Ayad Abutaha; John Chapman of Britain; Jacob Flickinger of the U.S. and Canada; Lalzawmi \"Zomi\" Frankcom of Australia; Britons James Henderson and James Kirby; and Damian Sobol of Poland.\n\nThe interfaith service is being held at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., starting at 11 a.m. ET. The service isn't open to the public, but live video is being streamed online. Organizers said they were expecting from 500 to 600 people to attend.\n\nThe service's officiants included the Very Rev. Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the cathedral's dean, and the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington. Also speaking: Rabbi Susan N. Shankman, senior rabbi of the Washington Hebrew Congregation, and Imam Talib M. Shareef, imam and president of Masjid Muhammad, the Nation's Mosque in Washington.\n\nBehind the group stood the choir -- and behind them, flags representing the seven aid workers' homelands.\n\nChef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the founder of World Central Kitchen, was also to deliver remarks. The workers were heroes, Andr\u00e9s said. He cited a favorite quote from John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath.\n\n\"Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there,\" he said. \"The seven souls we mourn today were there.\"\n\n\"People of all faiths, all gods, together under one roof will be able to hold our heroes in their hearts at the National Cathedral,\" Andr\u00e9s said. \"Saif, Zomi, Damian, Jacob, John, Jim, James, your families are far away from D.C., but we are sending our love and respect to all corners of the world.\"\n\nAttendees filled the main section of the cathedral's nave and its side transepts for the service, which included remembrances of the slain humanitarians, readings from Jewish, Muslim and Christian traditions and prayers for peace. Musicians performing include cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nThe gathering included second gentleman Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Harris, Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell.\n\nAs of early April, at least 224 humanitarian workers had been killed in the Israel-Hamas war that began last October. According to the U.N. Security Council, the figure is \"more than three times as many humanitarian aid workers killed in any single conflict recorded in a single year.\"\n\nIsrael has apologized for the attack that killed the seven workers, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying his country \"deeply regrets the tragic incident.\"\n\nThe Israeli military says the incident violated its protocols, punishing those responsible. But World Central Kitchen says that's not enough, calling for an independent investigation and noting Israel's acknowledgement that its aid team had followed established communications procedures.\n\n\"The root cause of the unjustified rocket fire on our convoy is the severe lack of food in Gaza,\" the charity said. \"Israel needs to dramatically increase the volume of food and medicine traveling by land if it is serious about supporting humanitarian aid.\"\n\nAndr\u00e9s also said the focus should be on ending the war.\n\n\"All civilians need to be protected, and all innocent people in Gaza need to be fed and safe. And all hostages must be released,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "gpb.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Georgia Public Broadcasting"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Central Kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Steinbeck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rabbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imam", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Imam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_Hollerith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Randolph Hollerith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_National_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington National Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interfaith_dialogue", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interfaith dialogue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariann_Budde", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mariann Budde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Hebrew_Congregation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Hebrew Congregation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Diocese_of_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Episcopal Diocese of Washington"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Andr\u00e9s", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Choir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dean (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transept", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transept"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_M._Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt M.

One staffer, Jacob Flickinger, a 33-year-old dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada, was called \"T\u00edo Jacob\" by children in Acapulco, where he volunteered aid in the wake of a hurricane, Andr\u00e9s said. Another, Damian Sob\u00f3l, had a street named after him in Turkey in honor of his efforts to help after an earthquake.\n\nSaifeddin \"Saif\" Abutaha, a 25-year-old Palestinian whose family flour business became the aid group's headquarters in Gaza, was texting his mother to ask whether she was asleep when he was killed, Andr\u00e9s said.\n\nAndr\u00e9s reiterated his demand for an investigation into the workers' deaths. \"I know we all have many unanswered questions about what happened and why. There is no excuse for these killings. None,\" he said. \"The official explanation is not good enough and we still demand an investigation into the actions of the IDF. Even one innocent life taken is one too many.\"\n\nHe urged \"leaders to lead by the same standards\" as the humanitarian workers. \"The fate of the many cannot be decided by the hateful and divisive actions of the few,\" he said.\n\nThe celebration of life was held under the sweeping ceilings and stained glass windows of the cathedral and was punctuated with musical performances, including from famed cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell and Sen. Chris Van Hollen attended the ceremony.\n\nThree faith leaders of the Washington area - Imam Talib Shareef, Rabbi Susan Shankman, and Archbishop Wilton Cardinal Gregory - offered prayers in memory of the workers.\n\nRafah invasion: Israel poised to invade Rafah, where more than 1 million Gazans take shelter\n\nThe group of staffers - which included British citizens John Chapman, 57, James Henderson, 33, and James Kirby, 47, and Lalzawmi Frankcom, 43, of Australia - were killed after an Israeli drone struck their convoy carrying aid through a deconflicted zone in Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip.\n\nThe drone hit the group as it left a warehouse after it unloaded more than 100 tons of aid in two armored trucks branded with World Central Kitchen's logo. The convoy had informed the IDF of its movements, according to the aid group. The organization halted its humanitarian aid efforts in Gaza - previously one of the largest in operation in the war-torn enclave - in response to the workers' deaths.\n\nThe deaths fueled outrage at the IDF's conduct in its ongoing siege in Gaza, where more than 34,000 Palestinians have died since Israel launched a sweeping military operation in response to Hamas' surprise attack on Israeli border communities on Oct. 7. The U.N. said the World Central Kitchen's staffer deaths brought the number of aid workers killed in the conflict to \"at least\" 224.\n\nPresident Joe Biden expressed outrage over the incident, saying Israel had not \"done enough to protect aid workers\" in Gaza. Biden spoke with Andr\u00e9s and called the workers' deaths a \"tragedy\" that demanded a speedy investigation.\n\nThe incident also led to a rare apology from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the attack unintentional. An internal investigation by the Israeli military called the strike a \"grave mistake\" and said those who struck the convoy believed it carried Hamas operatives, according to an IDF statement.\n\nTwo IDF officers were fired for their involvement, a move WCK said was an \"important step forward\" but insufficient. The report, the organization said, showed that the IDF did not follow its own \"protocols, chain of command and rules of engagement\" when it \"deployed deadly force.\"\n\nCybele Mayes-Osterman is a breaking news reporter for USA Today.

There is no excuse for these killings none. The official explanation is not good enough,' Andres said. 'And we still obviously demand an investigation into the actions of the IDF against our team.'\n\nThe chef, restaurateur and World Central Kitchen founder broke down at times during his 19-minute eulogy, with Emhoff seated front row.\n\nCelebrity chef Jose Andres continued to demand answers Thursday at the memorial service at Washington's National Cathedral for the seven World Central Kitchen workers killed by an Israeli strike in Gaza\n\nChef Jose Andres is seated among the masses ahead of Thursday's service for the seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza on April 1. Most of the 560 in the audience worked for the hunger non-profit that Andres founded\n\nChef and World Central Kitchen Founder Jose Andres walks to his seat showing emotion ahead of Thursday's memorial for the seven WCK workers killed in Gaza on April 1\n\nThe Biden administration was represented by second gentleman Doug Emjoff, who was seated in the front row next to Kurt Campbell, the deputy secretary of State\n\n'They risked everything to feed people that they did not know and will never meet,' Andres said. 'In the worst moments the best of humanity shows up. They were the best of humanity. Their examples should inspire us to do better - to be better.'\n\nOverall, 560 invited guests filled the National Cathedral - a majority of whom do work for the non-profit, which travels to disaster zones and feeds people all over the world.\n\n'I know there are also many questions about why World Central Kitchen was in Gaza. We ask ourselves the same question day and night,' the chef admitted. 'We are all consumed with anger, regret and sorrow.'\n\nHe said the same questions were asked when the hunger charity moved into Ukraine shortly after Russia's invasion.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen lost workers in Ukraine too, Andres noted.\n\n'When I will tell Ukrainians they are cooking too close to the front lines, they say they will be there anyway, with or without World Central Kitchen, there were children and elderly to feed. These were their communites after all,' Andres said.\n\n'Ukrainians were feeding the people of Ukraine, just like in Gaza, Palestinians feeding Palestinians, people feeding people, that's what we do at World Central Kitchen. We stand next to communities as they feed themselves, nourish themselves, heal themselves,' he continued.\n\nSecond gentleman Doug Emhoff watches the procession into the National Cathedral at the top of Thursday's memorial for the seven World Central Kitchen workers who died feeding people in Gaza\n\nCelebrity chef Jose Andres walks to his seat at Thursday's solemn service at Washington's National Cathedral\n\nAmerican cellist Yo-Yo Ma performed after Chef Jose Andres' eulogy Thursday at the National Cathedral\n\n'People don't want our pity, they want our respect,' Andres added. 'Our only way to show respect is facing the mayhem alongside them.'\n\n'We show them that they are not alone in the darkness,' he said.\n\nAndres talked about how his own daughter wanted to go into Ukraine and he pressed that she didn't.\n\nShe answered, Andres said, by saying, 'How are young people supposed to change the world if we're not willing to take risks?'\n\n'Food is a universal human right. Feeding each other, cooking and eating together, is what makes us human,' Andres said.\n\nHe said of the seven workers that their words and actions should 'build longer tables not higher walls.'\n\n'Because the fate of the many cannot be decided by the hateful and divisive actions of the few,' Andres said.\n\n'Food can never be a weapon of war. Humanitarians can never be targets. Because they are the best of us,' the chef said.\n\nAndres told Reuters two days after the killings that he believed that Israel deliberately attacked the convoy 'systematically, car by car.'\n\n'This was not just a bad luck situation where \"oops\" we dropped the bomb in the wrong place,' he said.\n\n'The U.S. must do more to tell Prime Minister Netanyahu this war needs to end now,' the D.C.-based celebrity chef also encouraged.\n\nBiden phoned Andres in the direct aftermath of the attack - but decided to go ahead with a planned trip to Syracuse to visit a chip factory instead of joining mourners Thursday at the National Cathedral.\n\nNational Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Wednesday 'the administration will be well-represented at that event.'\n\n'Well the president will have a letter from him read at the service and you will see the second gentleman there,' Sullivan said.\n\nBiden's letter was never read aloud as part of the official program.\n\n'The president, of couse, has had a longstanding plan to go up to Micron, the facility up in Syracuse. He will continue with that. But he has spoken directly with Chef Jose Andres about this tragic event and of course in the immediate aftermath of it picked up the phone and called Bibi Netanyahu,' Sullivan also offered.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Central_Kitchen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Central Kitchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Andr\u00e9s", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_National_Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington National Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Emhoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Doug Emhoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-Yo_Ma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yo-Yo Ma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Funeral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukrainians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_M._Campbell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kurt M.

Their examples should inspire us to do better, to be better,\" he said.\n\nAndres said WCK continues to demand an investigation into the actions of the Israeli forces against its workers, and that the official explanation was not good enough.\n\n\"There is no excuse for these killings. None,\" he said.\n\nThe service included readings and prayers from the Muslim, Jewish and Christian traditions and a musical tribute by renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma.\n\nMore than 500 people attended, including families of the victims, WCK staff, U.S. officials and diplomats from more than 30 countries, according to a WCK representative.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' husband Doug Emhoff represented the White House, while Biden was traveling in New York.\n\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Heather Timmons and Bill Berkrot)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

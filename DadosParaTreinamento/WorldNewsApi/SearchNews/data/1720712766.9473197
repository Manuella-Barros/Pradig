{"id": 232095758, "title": "There are reports of civilian casualties in the Israel hostage rescue. But what is a 'civilian'?", "text": "Almog Meir Jan, 21, learned shortly after his rescue that his 57-year-old father, Yossi, had passed away a few hours earlier. Family members report that he literally wasted away from grief and anxiety. His funeral was on Sunday. And 41-year-old Shlomi Ziv, an interior designer, returned to his wife of 17 years, who spent so many nights in the last eight months sitting outside their front door, waiting and hoping for his return. We know little about \u201cOperation Arnon\u201d other than that it was insanely brilliant and daring. Like \u2014 Entebbe level brilliant. Carried out by the super-elite \u201cYamam\u201d police unit, the team was led by Arnon Zamora, a 36-year-old father of two who was, by all accounts, remarkably brave and heroic. Zamora had led the fight against Hamas terrorists at Kibbutz Yad Mordechai \u2014 just north of the Gaza Strip \u2014 on October 7, repelling them. Had he not done so they may well have carried on to the nearby city of Ashkelon to continue their killing spree. Saturday\u2019s daring daytime raid was preceded by an operation nearby in an area of the Gaza Strip where the IDF had not previously been active. That distraction allowed the special forces to enter both apartments simultaneously. Due to their proximity, there was a huge concern that noise from one attack might forewarn the Hamas \u201ccivilian\u201d guards at the other. Entry into the \u201ccivilian apartments\u201d was timed with excruciating precision. Distraction and surprise were critical elements for operational success.", "summary": "Civilians, in my universe, also do not typically lock up hostages in their homes.

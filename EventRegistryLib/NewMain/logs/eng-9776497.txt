Cuban boxers, for example, have won the second-highest amount of medals in Olympic history at 78, with 41 of them gold.\n\nSince the 1972 Munich Games, Cuba has consistently ranked in the top 20 medal-earning countries. Far wealthier countries like Canada, New Zealand and Belgium -- a country with a similar population size to Cuba -- routinely rank below.\n\nThe Paris 2024 games may change this. Only 62 athletes will compete under the Cuban flag at this year's Games. However, 21 Cubans will compete under other flags, including the refugee Olympic team.\n\nThis delegation is the smallest Cuba has sent to the Olympics since 1964 in Tokyo. It is also the first time a Cuban gold medal winner will represent the refugee team. It is a telling revelation about the current state of sport in Cuba. It also reveals how seriousness Cuba's current socioeconomic crisis really is.\n\nGlobal solidarity\n\nSince 2021, nearly 500,000 Cubans, or five per cent of the population, have left the country. Many of these migrants are young, highly skilled professionals. Cubans, athletes included, are voting with their feet by leaving the country in droves and finding new homes in the United States, Europe and throughout the Americas.\n\nCuba routinely sends professionals abroad, notably in health care and sport, to work through state-sponsored delegations. Since the 1960s, Cuba's internationalism has bolstered solidarity and economic co-operation with dozens of countries.\n\nRead more: Economic crisis in Cuba: government missteps and tightening US sanctions are to blame\n\nCuba made bold co-operation efforts in the early days of COVID-19 to assist other countries in coping with the virus. Passengers in quarantined cruise ships were treated in Havana. As the world locked in, most of Cuba's solidarity partners failed to reciprocate with adequate financial support.\n\nAs a result, the country's economy broke down. While rationing was able to keep food on the table for some Cubans during the \"special period in peacetime\" of the 1990s, today's meagre salaries are unable to keep up with gross inflation. When inflation soars, shortages emerge and political unrest grows.\n\nIn 2024, fewer and fewer Cuban doctors are going abroad for their country's medical delegations. The Biden administration has called Cuba's medical delegations \"forced labour,\" despite international praise for Cuba's transformative development program.\n\nBut now, these highly trained Cuban health-care workers are heading to the United States. Many took the arduous journey beginning with a flight into Nicaragua and then going overland through Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico to the United States border.\n\nA brief history of Cuban sport\n\nEmerging from the pandemic, Cuba's partners are currently heavily sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Goods and supplies remain lean, as Cuba depends almost entirely on shipments from Moscow. Russia's heavily sanctioned merchant fleet does not help matters by adding costs and delays to shipments.\n\nIn exchange, Russia expects greater political loyalty from Cuba. Russian warships continue to arrive in Havana harbour. Some 200 Cuban mercenaries are fighting with Russian forces, while Russia leans on Cuba's intelligence services to collect information about the United States.\n\nThe Olympic podium will reflect these changes. Since the 1960s, Cuba has made sport a \"public good\" through the National Institute of Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER).\n\nIn 1961, Cuba's government nationalized all sporting clubs. Broad community-level participation in sports became a national right, if not an obligation. Cuban leader Fidel Castro committed to innovative elite sport recruitment. Boxers, baseball players, gymnasts and others would be identified early by government coaches. INDER built dedicated training centres and schools for prospective elite athletes.\n\nDespite brutal resource shortfalls, Cuba has invested in human resources for sports since the 1960s. By the 1990s, Cuba became a top Olympic delegation.\n\nEven amid economic chaos from the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which it later recovered from -- Cuba placed fifth in medals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. That year, 176 athletes took home 31 medals, including 14 gold. Under the auspices of South-South solidarity, by the early 2000s, Cuba offered free elite sports education to 1,900 students from 80 countries.\n\nCuban athletes abandoning national team\n\nCuba's solidarity is meant to bring mutual benefit, but the pandemic demonstrated how quickly partner nations can cut ties and lock in. Without remuneration and support for its international co-operation, Cuba's economy cracked. And some of their top athletes are letting go of national brand loyalty.\n\nTriple jumpers Pedro Pichardo, Jordan Diaz Fort\u00fan and Andy D\u00edaz will represent Portugal, Spain and Italy after they abandoned their delegations in 2021. Javelin thrower Yulenmis Aguilar and boxer Enmanuel \"The Prophet\" Reyes are now citizens of Spain and will carry that country's flag.\n\nThe Olympic refugee team includes Fernando Day\u00e1n Jorge Enr\u00edquez, who took gold in canoeing in Tokyo in 2021, and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora. The refugee team comprises 37 athletes from 11 countries participating in 12 sports. These athletes are assumed to face conflict or persecution if they were competing of their home country.\n\nFor this reason, Cuba is demanding both be removed from the refugee team. They argue that \"none of these Cuban athletes are uprooted by war or persecuted.\" Having gold medal athletes from Cuba at the Paris Olympics under the banner of refugees may be one insult too far for the Cuban government.\n\nSports are a critical pillar of national pride for Cubans and are deeply embedded in the country's culture and society. Sandlot baseball and the veneration of Olympians build a strong culture of national pride. Sport is a reminder of Cuba's impressive accomplishments, despite all its economic hardships and political strife.\n\nNow, Cuba's top athletes are raising and competing under the flags of other nations, and seemingly abandoning national pride in sport. Many politicians in Washington claim their case to be equivalent to that of displaced and persecuted persons. Others, like Marco Rubio, question how Cubans could be considered refugees when many regularly travel back to Cuba for short visits.\n\nIn fact Cuba has been the host country to the biggest number of refugees in the Caribbean. Today, with 500,000 Cubans currently living abroad, olympians included, it seems it's now Cuba's brand of international solidarity that will be taking the punches.", "source": {"uri":

Many took the arduous journey beginning with a flight into Nicaragua and then going overland through Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico to the United States border.\n\nEmerging from the pandemic, Cuba's partners are currently heavily sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Goods and supplies remain lean, as Cuba depends almost entirely on shipments from Moscow. Russia's heavily sanctioned merchant fleet does not help matters by adding costs and delays to shipments.\n\nIn exchange, Russia expects greater political loyalty from Cuba. Russian warships continue to arrive in Havana harbour. Some 200 Cuban mercenaries are fighting with Russian forces, while Russia leans on Cuba's intelligence services to collect information about the United States.\n\nThe Olympic podium will reflect these changes. Since the 1960s, Cuba has made sport a \"public good\" through the National Institute of Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER).\n\nIn 1961, Cuba's government nationalized all sporting clubs. Broad community-level participation in sports became a national right, if not an obligation. Cuban leader Fidel Castro committed to innovative elite sport recruitment. Boxers, baseball players, gymnasts and others would be identified early by government coaches. INDER built dedicated training centres and schools for prospective elite athletes.\n\nDespite brutal resource shortfalls, Cuba has invested in human resources for sports since the 1960s. By the 1990s, Cuba became a top Olympic delegation.\n\nEven amid economic chaos from the collapse of the Soviet Union -- which it later recovered from -- Cuba placed fifth in medals at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. That year, 176 athletes took home 31 medals, including 14 gold. Under the auspices of South-South solidarity, by the early 2000s, Cuba offered free elite sports education to 1,900 students from 80 countries.\n\nCuba's solidarity is meant to bring mutual benefit, but the pandemic demonstrated how quickly partner nations can cut ties and lock in. Without remuneration and support for its international co-operation, Cuba's economy cracked. And some of their top athletes are letting go of national brand loyalty.\n\nTriple jumpers Pedro Pichardo, Jordan Diaz Fort\u00fan and Andy D\u00edaz will represent Portugal, Spain and Italy after they abandoned their delegations in 2021. Javelin thrower Yulenmis Aguilar and boxer Enmanuel \"The Prophet\" Reyes are now citizens of Spain and will carry that country's flag.\n\nThe Olympic refugee team includes Fernando Day\u00e1n Jorge Enr\u00edquez, who took gold in canoeing in Tokyo in 2021, and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora. The refugee team comprises 37 athletes from 11 countries participating in 12 sports. These athletes are assumed to face conflict or persecution if they were competing of their home country.\n\nFor this reason, Cuba is demanding both be removed from the refugee team. They argue that \"none of these Cuban athletes are uprooted by war or persecuted.\" Having gold medal athletes from Cuba at the Paris Olympics under the banner of refugees may be one insult too far for the Cuban government.\n\nSports are a critical pillar of national pride for Cubans and are deeply embedded in the country's culture and society. Sandlot baseball and the veneration of Olympians build a strong culture of national pride. Sport is a reminder of Cuba's impressive accomplishments, despite all its economic hardships and political strife.\n\nNow, Cuba's top athletes are raising and competing under the flags of other nations, and seemingly abandoning national pride in sport. Many politicians in Washington claim their case to be equivalent to that of displaced and persecuted persons. Others, like Marco Rubio, question how Cubans could be considered refugees when many regularly travel back to Cuba for short visits.\n\nIn fact Cuba has been the host country to the biggest number of refugees in the Caribbean. Today, with 500,000 Cubans currently living abroad, Olympians included, it seems it's now Cuba's brand of international solidarity that will be taking the punches.\n\nRobert Huish received funding

Disclosure information is available on the original site.\n\n___\n\nAuthor: Robert Huish, Associate Professor in International Development Studies, Dalhousie University\n\nCuba is often expected to punch above its weight at the Olympics. Cuban boxers, for example, have won the second-highest amount of medals in Olympic history at 78, with 41 of them gold.\n\nSince the 1972 Munich Games, Cuba has consistently ranked in the top 20 medal-earning countries. Far wealthier countries like Canada, New Zealand and Belgium -- a country with a similar population size to Cuba -- routinely rank below.\n\nThe Paris 2024 games may change this. Only 62 athletes will compete under the Cuban flag at this year's Games. However, 21 Cubans will compete under other flags, including the refugee Olympic team.\n\nThis delegation is the smallest Cuba has sent to the Olympics since 1964 in Tokyo. It is also the first time a Cuban gold medal winner will represent the refugee team. It is a telling revelation about the current state of sport in Cuba. It also reveals how seriousness Cuba's current socioeconomic crisis really is.\n\nGlobal solidarity\n\nSince 2021, nearly 500,000 Cubans, or five per cent of the population, have left the country. Many of these migrants are young, highly skilled professionals. Cubans, athletes included, are voting with their feet by leaving the country in droves and finding new homes in the United States, Europe and throughout the Americas.\n\nCuba routinely sends professionals abroad, notably in health care and sport, to work through state-sponsored delegations. Since the 1960s, Cuba's internationalism has bolstered solidarity and economic co-operation with dozens of countries.\n\nCuba made bold co-operation efforts in the early days of COVID-19 to assist other countries in coping with the virus. Passengers in quarantined cruise ships were treated in Havana. As the world locked in, most of Cuba's solidarity partners failed to reciprocate with adequate financial support.\n\nAs a result, the country's economy broke down. While rationing was able to keep food on the table for some Cubans during the \"special period in peacetime\" of the 1990s, today's meagre salaries are unable to keep up with gross inflation. When inflation soars, shortages emerge and political unrest grows.\n\nIn 2024, fewer and fewer Cuban doctors are going abroad for their country's medical delegations. The Biden administration has called Cuba's medical delegations \"forced labour,\" despite international praise for Cuba's transformative development program.\n\nBut now, these highly trained Cuban health-care workers are heading to the United States. Many took the arduous journey beginning with a flight into Nicaragua and then going overland through Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico to the United States border.\n\nA brief history of Cuban sport\n\nEmerging from the pandemic, Cuba's partners are currently heavily sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela. Goods and supplies remain lean, as Cuba depends almost entirely on shipments from Moscow. Russia's heavily sanctioned merchant fleet does not help matters by adding costs and delays to shipments.\n\nIn exchange, Russia expects greater political loyalty from Cuba. Russian warships continue to arrive in Havana harbour. Some 200 Cuban mercenaries are fighting with Russian forces, while Russia leans on Cuba's intelligence services to collect information about the United States.\n\nThe Olympic podium will reflect these changes. Since the 1960s, Cuba has made sport a \"public good\" through the National Institute of Sports, Physical Education, and Recreation (INDER).\n\nIn 1961, Cuba's government nationalized all sporting clubs.

Without remuneration and support for its international co-operation, Cuba's economy cracked. And some of their top athletes are letting go of national brand loyalty.\n\nTriple jumpers Pedro Pichardo, Jordan Diaz Fort\u00fan and Andy D\u00edaz will represent Portugal, Spain and Italy after they abandoned their delegations in 2021. Javelin thrower Yulenmis Aguilar and boxer Enmanuel \"The Prophet\" Reyes are now citizens of Spain and will carry that country's flag.\n\nThe Olympic refugee team includes Fernando Day\u00e1n Jorge Enr\u00edquez, who took gold in canoeing in Tokyo in 2021, and Cuban weightlifter Ramiro Mora.

And that's not counting unknown numbers of \"gotaways.\"\n\n\"We have no idea who some of these people are. We have no idea if they have criminal records,\" Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said on the Senate floor this month.\n\nAnd the illegal entrants are receiving generous benefits -- infuriating immigrants who did it the right way, Rubio noted.\n\n\"One of the things I see a lot in South Florida are people that have been in this country, maybe they came from Cuba 45 years ago, they've worked here their entire lives,\" the senator, the son of Cuban immigrants, said.\n\n\"And then they run into somebody who just got here from Cuba three months ago, who's 29 years old, doesn't work, and is given $1,500 a month in benefits by our government because they're a refugee. That refugee, a year later, is traveling back to Cuba 15 times.\"\n\nNobody understands better than an American of Cuban ancestry the dire conditions of communism.\n\nBut the mess that Biden and

This has progressively led to severe shortages affecting all prioritised health sectors, including treatment of cardiovascular diseases, paediatric oncology, oncology and even obstetrics and gynaecology.\n\n\"The U.S. Government must end the restrictions enforced on Cuba as a result of the long-standing embargo and the recent SSOT redesignation,\" the experts said.\n\n\"Unilateral designation of Cuba as a SSOT is contrary to fundamental principles of international law, including the principle of sovereign equality of states, non-intervention in the domestic affairs of states, and peaceful settlement of international disputes.\n\n\"Recalling all UN resolutions stressing the adverse humanitarian impact of unilateral coercive measures, and wide international support for the lifting of the Cuba embargo, we urge the U.S. Government to fully comply with all its international human rights obligations, even extraterritorially, and to undertake prompt action to terminate such measures\".\n\nThe experts have already shared their concerns with the U.S. Government.\n\n/Public Release.

in the health, economic and social spheres.\n\nMayra Arevich Marin, Minister of MICOM, added that as officials they should explain to the population the effects of the blockade so that they are aware

that not only affects them as an organization but also influences the services they provide.\n\nShe stated that access to technologies is hindered by the obstacles to which they are exposed and that the relationship with the different suppliers is affected by the pressure they suffer if they do business with Cuba.\n\nAriadne Plasencia Castro, president of the Informatics and Communications Business Group, pointed out that there is interference in technological sovereignty and there are limitations in the development of software.\n\nPablo Julio Pla Feria, president of Correos de Cuba, reflected that the problems in parcel shipments to Cuba from abroad mainly harm the population because Cubans living in the United States have to pay a higher percentage for the shipments, since the operation is carried out by private agencies or third countries.\n\nHe informed that Correos de Cuba is hindered in its financial operations with other countries because the banks refuse transfers due

The expansion of related restrictions has reportedly deepened the country's international isolation for over 62 years as a result of the U.S. embargo,\" the experts said in a joint statement.\n\nThe three UN experts are Alena Douhan, Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights; Cecilia M. Bailliet, Independent Expert on human rights and international solidarity; George Katrougalos, Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order.\n\nAccording to them, the SSOT redesignation has brought a range of additional economic and financial restrictions, which have exacerbated the country's economic difficulties. This has hindered Cuba's ability to address the needs of its population at a critical time when it faces significant economic challenges.\n\n\"Cuba's SSOT redesignation has added to the challenges already faced by the people of Cuba during the last three to four years, alongside serious disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, and the economic and financial developments which have affected global supply chains, and commodity and energy prices,\" the experts said.\n\nThe experts urged the U.S. government to lift the restrictions on Cuba resulting from the longstanding embargo and the SSOT redesignation. They noted that the unilateral designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism contradicts fundamental principles of international law, including the sovereign equality of states, non-intervention in domestic affairs, and the peaceful settlement of disputes. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cuba"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSOT_(satellite)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "SSOT (satellite)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_embargo_against_Cuba", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States embargo against Cuba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_special_rapporteur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations special rapporteur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-sponsored_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State-sponsored terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coercion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interventionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-interventionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776497", "eventUri": "eng-9776497", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Geneva"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 15}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

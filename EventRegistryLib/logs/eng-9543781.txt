Another round swept the Gulf Coast and Southeast around the 10th before a couple of small events mid-month.\n\nRepeated rounds of violent thunderstorms erupted in the central states during the month's final six days. Outbreaks on the 26th, 27th, 28th and 30th produced more than 100 tornadoes.\n\nHere are some of the most significant statistics from the month:\n\n-- Tornadoes were reported on 18 days according to the Weather Service.\n\n-- At least six people died in tornadoes, all in April's final week. Three tornadoes in Oklahoma took four lives, while Kansas and Iowa each recorded one death.\n\n-- Long-track, intense tornadoes crossed eastern Nebraska and western Iowa during an outbreak on April 26. Nineteen tornadoes have been confirmed in the Omaha area. Five were rated EF3 on the 0-to-5 Enhanced Fujita scale for intensity and were the strongest in the region since June 2014, according to the Weather Service.\n\n-- 2024's first violent tornado, rated EF4, struck April 27 after dark, southeast of Ardmore, near Marietta, Okla. It was the first confirmed EF4 or stronger twister in over a year. It was also the first EF4 in the state since May 9, 2016, according to the Weather Service.\n\n-- A tornado occurred in Alaska on a mountaintop near Anchorage on April 19. While it was a landspout - which forms through different processes than typical twisters in the Plains - it was rare. It joins only three or four others documented in Alaska since 1950 and was the earliest to form.\n\n-- The Weather Service issued 625 tornado warnings during the month. While a huge number, it's only about half the count during April 2011, when there were just shy of 1,200 warnings.\n\n-- Despite the exceptional April for tornadoes, the Weather Service received an average number of severe thunderstorm reports overall - including instances of large hail and damaging straight-line winds. It received 2,421 such reports compared to the average of 2,184.\n\nApril's tornado count in perspective\n\nApril is the third-most active severe weather and tornado month of the year as streams of cold and dry and warm and moist air clash. Its average of 182 tornadoes trails May's 268 and June's 213.\n\nWhile May and June tend to have higher twister totals, April is known for its violent outbreaks, including infamous events in 2011 and 1974.\n\nStill, it can be fickle. When chilly air dominates, storminess is suppressed. But during periods in which warm, humid air surges north from the Gulf of Mexico and collides with the leftover chill from winter, explosive storms can develop.\n\nLast month brought frequent surges of humid air northward from the gulf, especially in the month's final week.\n\nMore tornadoes are probable in the days ahead\n\nEvery day from April 25 to May 2 has featured tornadoes, and there's a legitimate chance this streak will continue for another week or so.\n\nLower-end tornado threats are predicted in the southern and central Plains through the weekend. Then another large system, with the potential to be a major tornado producer, is poised to spill into the central United States early next week.\n\nBeyond that, the forecast is less clear, partly because predictions are less reliable so far into the future and partly because the pattern projected by computer models appears less favorable.\n\nBut given the season thus far and the tendency for the central states to be a frequent battleground between cold and warm air, more storminess seems probable well past early next week.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news",

Then another large system, with the potential to be a major tornado producer, is poised to spill into the central United States early next week.\n\nBeyond that, the forecast is less clear, partly because predictions are less reliable so far into the future and partly because the pattern projected by computer models appears less favorable.\n\nBut given the season thus far and the tendency for the central states to be a frequent battleground between cold and warm air, more storminess seems probable well past early next week.", "source": {"uri": "thegazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "becky_lutgen_gardner@thegazette.com", "name": "Becky Lutgen Gardner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mid-Atlantic (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeastern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf Coast of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Mexico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Mexico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=2967c3fb-8599-5525-a092-f91047a6deff&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543781", "eventUri": "eng-9543781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "dateEnd": "2024-05-02", "textStart": 2056, "textEnd": 2073}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 947, "textEnd": 955}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1284}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-04-", "textStart": 335, "textEnd": 345}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

That's due to the best setup of warm air, jet-stream disturbances swinging out of the West and plentiful moisture east of the Rockies.\n\nAnd that May risk is usually greatest in the Plains, from Texas to Iowa, an area some refer to as \"tornado alley.\"\n\n(Further beef up your forecast with our detailed, hour-by-hour breakdown for the next 8 days - only available on our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nHere are five memorable May outbreaks from the last 50-plus years.\n\nMay 22, 2011: 48 tornadoes | 159 total deaths | 1,221 injuries | $3.8 billion damage\n\nWhile spawning fewer tornadoes than other outbreaks, this one will be forever remembered for the Joplin tornado.\n\nThis mile-wide tornado tore a six-mile long gash through the most densely populated sections of Joplin, a town of more than 50,000 people. More than two percent of the population was injured by this tornado. Pockets of high-end EF5 damage contributed to a death toll many thought had been relegated to the pre-Doppler-radar past: 158 lives lost.\n\nThe Joplin tornado was responsible for more than $3 billion dollars in damage (2023 USD) and remains the single costliest tornado in U.S. history. Seventy-five percent of the city was damaged or destroyed, leaving neighborhoods unrecognizable. St. John's Hospital and Joplin High School were severely damaged by the 200+ mph winds.\n\nThe first tornado of the day, though, was not in Joplin, but rather in Minneapolis. An EF1 tornado tore through the west and north sides of the Minneapolis metro earlier that afternoon. One person was killed along the tornado's six-mile path through north Minneapolis, St. Louis Park, Golden Valley, Fridley, Mounds View and Blaine.\n\n(For even more granular weather data tracking in your area, view your 15-minute details forecast in our Premium Pro experience.)\n\nMay 24-26, 2011: 186 tornadoes | 18 deaths | 402 injuries\n\nJust two days after Joplin, the atmosphere recharged for a multi-day high-impact tornado outbreak.\n\nMay 24 focused on Oklahoma, where an EF5 tornado tracked nearly 65 miles through the Oklahoma City suburbs of El Reno, Piedmont, and Guthrie.\n\nThis EF5 tornado claimed seven lives in central Oklahoma, while injuring 112. Additional Oklahoma killer tornadoes touched down in Logan, Grady and Major County. Other killer tornadoes in this outbreak spun through Stafford County, Kansas, as well as Franklin and Johnson County, Arkansas.\n\nMay 25 brought this tornado outbreak east into the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, with dozens of additional twisters.\n\nMay 3-4, 1999: 72 Oklahoma tornadoes | 36 deaths, $1 billion damage from OKC metro F5\n\nSeventy-two tornadoes touched down in the Sooner State, mostly on May 3, a record for any Oklahoma outbreak since 1950.\n\nThat included the first F5 to strike the Oklahoma City metro. This infamous tornado tracked from Bridge Creek into Moore, Del City, Midwest City and southern parts of Oklahoma City, taking 36 lives, injuring hundreds more, and damaging or destroying some 9,000 homes and apartments. It was the United States' first tornado to cause a billion dollars in losses.\n\nThree other F4 tornadoes touched down in Oklahoma and Kansas. One F4 swept through the Wichita, Kansas, suburb of Haysville, killing six people and damaging 177 homes and businesses.\n\nMay 4-5, 2003: 106 tornadoes | 38 deaths | 348 injuries | $550.8 million damage\n\nThis outbreak began an extremely active week of tornadoes. From May 3-11, 366 tornadoes touched down, making it one of the most hectic periods of extended tornado activity in U.S. history.\n\nThe heart of this outbreak struck the central Plains to the Tennessee Valley. Among the more notorious, a deadly F4 tornado hit Kansas City, Kansas, on May 4, with killer tornadoes hitting Stockton and Pierce City, Missouri, the same day.\n\nAnother F4 tore through downtown Jackson, Tennessee (population then 60,000), claiming 11 lives. Additional tornadoes touched down in the Mid-South on May 5.\n\nMay 26-29, 1973: 105 tornadoes | 22 deaths | 801 injuries\n\nA prolonged outbreak of tornadoes began in the Central and Southern Plains on May 26 and pressed east into the Deep South on May 27-28.\n\nAmong the more notable tornadoes, a long-track F4 tore a swath across nearly the full width of central Alabama on May 27 from Demopolis to Greensboro, Brent, Centreville, and Montevallo, before lifting and setting down intermittently on its way to Mount Cheaha. Ninety percent of Brent was destroyed. Five of the seven Alabamians killed by this tornado died in that town.\n\nThe tornado was on the ground for nearly 140 miles.\n\nIn the late stages of this outbreak, an F3 ripped through the north side of the Athens, Georgia, area, causing $10 million in losses (1973 USD).\n\nLate May 1973 is more famous for the Union City, Oklahoma, tornado that happened two days before this outbreak.\n\nFor the first time, researchers from the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, were able to position storm chasers for an intercept of this destructive tornado, documenting the entire life cycle of this storm. It's something we take for granted today in an era of streaming video, social media and weather apps.\n\nThe NSSL research meteorologists later found rotation aloft before the tornado touched down, establishing a bedrock nowcasting technique still used today.\n\nMORE ON WEATHER.COM\n\n- How To Prepare For Severe Weather Like A Meteorologist\n\n- 15 Severe Safety Tips That Could Save Your

Not only do supercells often bring strong winds and large hailstones, but they can also spawn tornadoes, and this one birthed multiple.\n\nThat's not exactly an odd occurrence given that tornadoes produced by supercells are the most common kind, but around 10:26 pm CDT, near the town of Loveland, the storm gave rise to a super-rare anticyclonic tornado.\n\nTornadoes that occur in the Northern Hemisphere normally rotate anticlockwise, but in an estimated 1 percent of cases, they instead spin clockwise. Such anticyclonic tornadoes are normally fairly weak, tornado analyst Paul Robinson told the Washington Post in 2013.\n\nOn this occasion, however, the unusual tornado continued to go against convention as it remained powerful, with the National Weather Service (NWS) putting out a statement deeming the twister as \"large and extremely dangerous\". Luckily, it occurred mostly over farmland, with no reported casualties - just a lot of uprooted trees.\n\nThe statement also revealed that at one point, the tornado achieved something else out of the ordinary: it was \"nearly stationary\", or at the very least moving extremely slowly.\n\n\"It's not common to see (tornadoes) be nearly stationary,\" NWS meteorologist Rick Smith explained to CNN. \"Tornadoes are almost always going to just go wherever the supercell thunderstorm goes.\"\n\nThis atypical tornado was far from the only one getting things a bit backward that day. Normally, tornadoes in the US travel from west to east, but the mother supercell popped out another irregular offspring that ended up looping back over the path it just took.\n\nAccording to Smith, it's possible that the two unusual tornadoes were even active at the same time. \"You certainly don't see this every day,\" said the meteorologist.\n\nThough tornadoes can happen at any time, the spring months usually see an uptick in storms in the US, with the peak \"tornado season\" for states such as Oklahoma occurring from May to early June and through to July further north. The lead up to this year's season has been pretty busy, with the NWS Storm Prediction Center reporting a preliminary figure of 300 tornadoes in the US during April, the second highest figure for the month on record.", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supercell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticyclonic_tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anticyclonic tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_climatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado climatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loveland,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loveland, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Loveland, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Hemisphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Hemisphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Prediction_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storm Prediction Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74082/aImg/76025/tornado-meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543781", "eventUri": "eng-9543781", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-30", "textStart": 227, "textEnd": 235}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

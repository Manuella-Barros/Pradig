{"id": 231440488, "title": "On my radar: Billy Corgan\u2019s cultural highlights", "text": "Born in Chicago in 1967, Billy Corgan is the frontman of the Smashing Pumpkins. The band have released 12 studio albums, including Atum: A Rock Opera in Three Acts (2022\u20132023); he has also released music solo and with the supergroup Zwan. He owns the National Wrestling Alliance, and is the subject of US reality TV series Billy Corgan\u2019s Adventures in Carnyland. Along with his wife, Chloe Mendel, he runs Madame Zuzu\u2019s Tea House in Highland Park, Illinois. The Smashing Pumpkins are on the UK leg of their The World Is a Vampire tour until 14 June; tonight they play the O2 in London. 1. Film The Boy and the Heron (dir Hayao Miyazaki, 2023) I went with my son, who\u2019s eight, to the local arthouse. It\u2019s about a boy who loses his mother quite young, which certainly touched me because, in a way, I lost my mother when I was four, when she was institutionalised. It\u2019s a beautifully animated movie, but a bit cryptic. As we were leaving I asked my son to explain it to me. He went: \u201cWell, it was about a boy and a blue heron.\u201d Sometimes it takes a child to tell you that the truth is right in front of you. It was a beautiful moment between my son and I. 2. Concert Mozart\u2019s Requiem, Lyric Opera of Chicago I recently saw a performance of this with Enrique Mazzola as the conductor. It was probably 60 people in the choir, 60 musicians on stage and another four soloists upfront singing. Of course, I\u2019d heard Requiem on recording before, but seeing it live with a world-class orchestra was almost like a religious experience. When you\u2019re standing in front of one of the all-time greats, listening to seven different melodies and polyphony \u2013 it\u2019s a level of genius I can\u2019t even contemplate, much less emulate. It\u2019s a humbling experience. 3. Restaurant Del Rio, Highwood, Illinois There\u2019s an Italian restaurant here where I live. It was originally a tango bar, where servicemen would go dancing in the 30s. It\u2019s been in the same family for almost 100 years. It has all the original decor: a vintage tin ceiling, a deco bar. There\u2019s stuff pasted on the wall that\u2019s probably been there for 80 years. It\u2019s a true relic that has somehow survived: the perfect meeting of past and present. Unfortunately, even though I\u2019m a consistent customer, there\u2019s only one thing I can eat there, which is the gluten-free pasta. 4. Collection The Bozeum Fans of The Simpsons, of course, know Krusty the Clown, who was based on Bozo the Clown, the most famous of which was in Chicago. Recently I was invited by the actor David Arquette, who now owns the Bozo franchise, to go see a guy who\u2019s the biggest Bozo collector in the world [Tom Holbrook]. I got a private tour of his Bozeum, which was pretty cool. Because it was such a merchandising cash cow, you can imagine what they could sell to kids: toys, dolls, soap, toothbrushes \u2013 anything a child would want, they put Bozo\u2019s name on it. 5. Song Kid Tigrrr \u2013 Skin Kid Tigrrr is an independent artist I\u2019m fond of, and she recently put out a song called Skin. Her music is kind of shoegazy: if you\u2019re a fan of, say, My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive, it would be in that genre. She performs a lot on her own, which is very brave, just her and a guitar. I\u2019ve never seen her live, but she posts clips all the time on Instagram, so I feel like I have. I\u2019ve written to her to encourage her to follow her own muse. 6. Book Every Man for Himself and God Against All by Werner Herzog I enjoyed Werner Herzog\u2019s memoir. His style is very laconic: he talks about these harrowing details where he almost loses his life multiple times, and speaks about it in such a calm German way that it\u2019s almost shocking. I guess that\u2019s in his film-making as well. There\u2019s a story where he\u2019s in a helicopter, shooting a movie on one of the most dangerous mountains in the world, and within minutes they\u2019re in a full-blown whiteout snowstorm where you can\u2019t even see your hand in front of your face. They were trapped up there for days and almost died.", "summary": "<p>The Smashing Pumpkins frontman on bonding with his son over Miyazaki, the genius of Mozart\u2019s Requiem, and the world\u2019s biggest Bozo the Clown collection</p><p>Born in Chicago in 1967, Billy Corgan is the frontman of the Smashing Pumpkins.

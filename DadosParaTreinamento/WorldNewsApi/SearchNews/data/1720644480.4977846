In opinion polls, 89 to 91 per cent of Canadians resoundingly supported a CDB that would bring Canadians with disabilities to the poverty level or higher. Thank you to all the advocates who wrote letters, attended demonstrations, hosted discussions, sat in panels, attended events and lobbied for the CDB.

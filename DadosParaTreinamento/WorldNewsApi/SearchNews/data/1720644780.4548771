{"id": 231266796, "title": "Rob Burrow honoured as rugby league fans pay tribute at Wembley after icon's death", "text": "Thousands of rugby league fans paid tribute to the late Rob Burrow during the men's Challenge Cup final between Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors at an emotional Wembley stadium. Burrow tragically died at the age of 41 last Sunday, four-and-a-half years after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease. The former Leeds Rhinos star made nearly 500 appearances in a golden era for the Yorkshire club, winning Super League eight times and lifting the Challenge Cup trophy twice. His battle with MND transcended rugby league and brought vital awareness to the illness, as well as raising millions of pounds for charity in the process. His former team-mate, Kevin Sinfield, also became a national treasure by completing a series of marathons and challenges in the fight to eliminate MND. The men's Challenge Cup final between Warrington and Wigan kicked off at 3:07pm to commemorate Burrow, who wore the number seven shirt throughout his distinguished career. Ahead of the match, Mirror Sport columnist Jamie Peacock told BBC Sport: \"It is [a poignant occasion] but it's about celebrating the good that Rob brought, not only to the world of rugby league but to the world as a whole. \"I think we're going to have an incredibly fitting game for that as well. It's about celebrating the great emotions of rugby league, and the great emotions and inspiration that Rob as an iconic player but also an iconic person brought to the world.\" During Katherine Jenkins' performance of Abide with Me, a larger banner with pictures of Burrow was held up by fans before a minute's silence took place, with both teams wearing orange t-shirts with 'Burrow 7' printed on the back. Prior to the main event at Wembley, the women's Challenge Cup was played, as St Helens beat Leeds 22-0. Another minute's silence was observed before kick-off and as planned for each of Saturday's four finals, a minute's applause took place in the seventh minute. Leeds head coach Lois Forsell, whose side wore special shirts in honour of Burrow, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Rugby League podcast: \"We've a job to do, it's that fine line where we don't want to make it too emotional but we'll be thinking about everything that Rob was in terms of resilience and character. \"In the women's game where we get the opportunity to play at Wembley, Rob got told that he was too small to play rugby; women got told that there probably wouldn't be that chance to play at Wembley. You can see a lot of similar characteristics so we'll be reflecting on the opportunity we've got and making sure we go away and get the win for Leeds.\" Both the women's and men's Challenge Cup finals followed the Champion Schools final between schools from Wigan and Cardiff. To close event, the 1895 Cup Final between Sheffield Eagles and Wakefield Trinity will take place at 5:45pm. RL commercial managing director Rhodri Jones said of the occassion: \"Once the shock and sadness of Sunday night's news had sunk in, we recognised the responsibility to provide a fitting celebration of a rugby league superhero. \"We are grateful to BBC Sport and Wembley Stadium for their support - and to all involved with the six clubs and two schools who will be playing at Wembley on Saturday. \"Challenge Cup final day has a great tradition of the rugby league family coming together \u2013 this year, for reasons none would have chosen, we will be united in grief, but also in paying suitable tribute to a player who has transcended the sport.\" Australian actor and rugby fan Russell Crowe urged fans to show their love for \"little champion\" Burrow at Wembley in a video message posted on Friday. \"I'd like to talk to you about the Challenge Cup final this weekend,\" Crowe told his followers. \"It is Wigan versus Warrington, but more specifically I want to talk about the passing of the little champion Rob Burrow. At the weekend, at Wembley, when the finals are taking place, in the seventh minute there will be a minute of celebration of Rob's life and contribution to this sport. \"Beautifully, it won't be a minutes silence it will be a minutes applause, which I think is fitting for the little champion. Personally I have some guilt to bear because I was supposed to do his podcast and it is one of those things I kept saying I'd get round to it and now I'll have to deal with the fact I messed that up. \"Anyway, if you love rugby league and you love what that little champion did in every jersey he played in - go to Wembley and celebrate his life, his career and celebrate the rugby league community.\"", "summary": "Leeds Rhinos legend and rugby league icon Rob Burrow, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2019, passed away last weekend aged 41 and was honoured during Saturday's Challenge Cup final", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/rob-burrow-wembley-challenge-cup-32987975", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989005.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rob-Burrow-tribute.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:07:37", "author": "Nathan Ridley,Nathan-Ridley", "authors": ["Nathan Ridley", "Nathan-Ridley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.062}

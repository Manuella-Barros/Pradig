What had been billed for months as the grand farewell, for the grandest of relationships between an athlete and his favourite hunting ground, may not be a farewell after all. Rafael Nadal could return to Roland Garros after this year \u2013 \u201cmaybe, maybe not.\u201d Ahead of the start of this year\u2019s French Open, Nadal bounced into his pre-tournament press conference, smirking and chirping at questions about his future \u2013 a far cry from his bleak outlook from a month ago \u2013 and left things tantalisingly ambiguous. \u201cIf I have to tell you it's 100% my last Roland Garros, sorry but I will not, because I cannot predict what's going on. I hope you understand,\u201d he was quoted as saying by Reuters. \u201cI don't want to close 100% the door\u2026 Maybe in one month and a half I'll say 'OK, it's enough, I can't keep going'. But today I cannot guarantee that it's going to be the last one.\u201d Order of play for day 2, what a day \u26a1\ufe0f Check out the full order of play ? pic.twitter.com/fYXsGy9K4L \u2014 Roland-Garros (@rolandgarros) May 26, 2024 Nadal, the 14-time champion who has always played this tournament as a top-five seed, was left to the mercy of the draw as an unseeded player this time around and was dealt a brutal first-round assignment against fourth seed and recent Italian Open champion Alexander Zverev, which takes place on Monday. Upbeat and playing \u201cwithout limitation\u201d for the first time in a year and a half, Nadal was not quick to complain about his upcoming opponent either. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying what I\u2019m doing again. Sorry, but I am feeling competitive in practices. Maybe not yet in matches, but in the practices, I am able to play almost against anyone. It\u2019s giving me some hope,\u201d he said. Scraps of hope is what Nadal must live on to be competitive after just 15 professional matches since the start of 2023 and a ranking of World No.275 as he has nursed adnominal and hip injuries. A month ago, Nadal arrived in Madrid struggling for fitness and rhythm, claiming he will not be able to play the French Open in the form and shape he was in at the time. That week, though, he was able to stitch together a few wins and leave with a positive mindset. Even though he ran into reality in Rome a week later, suffering a dire loss to Hubert Hurkacz in the second round, the rhythm seems to have returned, and an unusually confident persona has emerged. Even then it will be a tall order for him to take on the in-form Zverev, who may be mounting a title challenge himself \u2014 even while his domestic abuse trial kicks off in Berlin during this tournament. In terms of matchups, this is not a favourable one for Nadal either. Zverev\u2019s tall frame, power, and solid backhand nullify, to an extent, the Spaniard\u2019s greatest strength \u2013 his high-bouncing, topspin-laden lefty forehand which he uses to target a right-handed opponent\u2019s backhand. Given his recent injuries, Nadal has not been able to find much purchase on his serve either, which will not allow him to squeeze his way out of trouble under pressure. Effective returner Yet, Nadal\u2019s body of work on this ground makes it impossible to see this encounter as a foregone conclusion. If the Spaniard can construct points using his heavy forehand, and unleash it down the line with depth and accuracy, Zverev may find it difficult to cope. Nadal is also an effective returner, and while Zverev has a huge first serve, he has a notoriously poor record on his second serve. The German has also, over the years, shown a capacity to collapse \u2013 having lost a Major final from two sets and a break up, and as recently as this year\u2019s Australian Open, lost a semifinal from the same position. Miniscule chances may open up for Nadal to take control if the pressure of a hugely partisan crowd gets to Zverev and he begins to blink. This match \u2013 a realistic title contender taking on a 14-time champion in the first round \u2013 remains a rarity and is likely to be a blockbuster showdown for its larger significance. Despite all the narrative-rich subtext, Nadal will have to search for the kind of form and fight that he has not found in the last two years. The last time he did, after a fortnight of applying pain-numbing injections to address a chronic foot issue, he limped out of this very arena with the trophy.

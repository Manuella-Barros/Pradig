Earlier in the day, the Indian Prime Minister was accorded a ceremonial Guard of Honour at the Federal Chancellory in Vienna.

Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer welcomed the PM and hosted him for a private engagement. Nehammer was seen hugging the Indian Prime Minister and clicking a selfie with him as he arrived in Vienna. The Indian PM also received a rousing welcome from the Indian diaspora, complete with a special rendition of 'Vande Mataram' by Austrian artists.\n\nDuring PM Modi's visit to Austria, the two countries will explore ways to further deepen their relationship and closer cooperation on various geopolitical challenges. Former Indian PM Indira Gandhi was the last leader to visit Austria in 1983, making this visit even more special.\n\nPM Modi was welcomed by Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg at the airport. He will call on Austria President Alexander Van der Bellen and hold formal talks with Nehammer on Wednesday. The prime minister and the chancellor will also address business leaders from India and Austria. Earlier, PM Modi said the shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law form the bedrock upon which the two countries will build an ever-closer partnership. His remark came a day after Nehammer said, \"I very much look forward to welcoming Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, the world's largest democracy, next week in Vienna.\"\n\n\"Welcome to Vienna, PM @narendramodi ! It is a pleasure and honour to welcome you to Austria. Austria and India are friends and partners. I look forward to our political and economic discussions during your visit!\n\nIn response, Prime Minister Modi thanked the Chancellor for a 'warm welcome'. \"I look forward to our discussions tomorrow as well. Our nations will continue working together to further global good,\" he said on X.\n\nThe Prime Minister on Monday began his state visit to Russia to hold the 22nd India-Russia annual summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. It was the first visit by PM Modi since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war and his first bilateral visit in his new term. During his visit, PM Modi and the Russian President discussed ways to further strengthen the bilateral cooperation in sectors such as energy, trade, manufacturing and fertilisers.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Nehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Austria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Schallenberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Schallenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Van_der_Bellen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Van der Bellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_visit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State visit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme_Sports/Videos_and_Films", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Extreme Sports/Videos and Films", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/pmmodi-2-1720602975.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717811", "eventUri": "eng-9717811", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Gandhi's visit in 1983 was followed by the visit of then chancellor Fred Sinowatz in 1984, it said. Gandhi was in Vienna from June 16-18 during her 1983 visit, people familiar with the matter said. While there have been no prime ministerial visits from India since Indira Gandhi's visit, there have been President-level visits to the country.\n\nThe then president K R Narayanan visited Austria in 1999; then president Heinz Fischer visited in 2005; then Austrian Vice Chancellor Josef Proll in 2010; and then president Pratibha Devisingh Patil in 2011, according to the profile on the MEA website.

In addition, the conflict in the Middle East was a major topic and, apart from this difficult geopolitical situation, we also discussed the positive aspects of our cooperation,\" the Austrian Chancellor said.\n\nIn his speech, Prime Minister Modi said the two nations would work to \"connect the power of youth\" and strengthen each other in areas such as renewable energy, hydrogen, water and waste management and artificial intelligence.\n\nOn the second day of his visit, Narendra Modi received a guard of honour at a solemn reception at the Federal Chancellery. Modi, who became the first Indian prime minister to visit the country in 40 years, said that the \"Friendship\" between India and Austria would become even stronger in the times to come.\n\nOn Tuesday, Modi was greeted by Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg as he arrived at Vienna airport after a two-day visit to Russia.\n\nLater, the prime minister received a warm welcome when he met Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer for a private dinner ahead of their official talks on Wednesday.\n\nThe two leaders hugged each other and the Austrian Chancellor was even seen taking a selfie with PM Modi in a candid moment. The bonhomie between the two leaders was visible when Nehammer also posted these candid moments on X, calling India a \"friend\" and \"partner\".\n\n\"Welcome to Vienna, Prime Minister Narendra Modi! It is a pleasure and an honour to welcome you to Austria. Austria and India are friends and partners. I look forward to our political and economic discussions during your visit!\" tweeted the Austrian Chancellor.\n\nPrime Minister Modi responded by saying, \"The friendship between India and Austria is strong and it will become even stronger in the times to come.\"\n\n\"Thank you, Chancellor @karlnehammer, for your warm welcome. Our nations will continue to work together to promote the global good,\" he tweeted later.\n\nDuring his visit, Prime Minister Modi will call on President of the Republic of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen and will also hold talks with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on Wednesday.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the Chancellor will also address Indian and Austrian business leaders.\n\nOn Sunday, Prime Minister Modi said the shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law form the foundation on which the two countries will build an ever closer partnership.", "source": {"uri":

This marks his first bilateral visit to the country. He was welcomed at the airport by Austria's Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg.\n\nIn a message on X, Foreign Minister Schallenberg said, \"A warm welcome to Indian PM @narendramodi on his historic visit to Austria marking 75 years of diplomatic relations. The partnership between our nations is based on a joint commitment to global security, stability, and prosperity.\"\n\nThe MEA spokesperson also tweeted about the visit: \"PM Narendra Modi arrives in the historic city of Vienna on his first bilateral visit to Austria.

I look forward to our discussions tomorrow as well. Our nations will continue working together to further global good.\"\n\nChancellor Nehammer also tweeted, \"Welcome to Vienna, PM @narendramodi!

PM @narendramodi hosted by Austrian Chancellor @karlnehammer for a private engagement. This is the first meeting between the two leaders. Discussions and realizing full potential partnership lie ahead.\"\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Austria were established on November 10, 1949. Austria has been a steadfast and reliable partner for India, with bilateral relations that are wide-ranging, multi-dimensional, and mutually beneficial. The shared commitment to democracy and pluralism has reinforced their close ties. This year marks the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between India and Austria.\n\nDuring the visit, Prime Minister Modi will receive a ceremonial welcome, meet President Alexander Van der Bellen, and hold talks with Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

Additionally, Prime Minister Modi will interact with the Indian diaspora in Austria, which includes approximately 31,000 Indians, primarily from Kerala and Punjab.\n\nThe diaspora mainly consists of professionals in the healthcare sector and multilateral UN bodies, as well as businesspeople and self-employed individuals. The community is roughly evenly divided between NRIs and PIOs. Over 450 Indian students are pursuing higher education in Austria, with numbers expected to rise.\n\nPresident K.R. Narayanan's visit to Austria in November 1999 was the first state visit from India, reciprocated by Austrian President Dr Heinz Fischer in February 2005.\n\nThe last Indian Prime Ministerial visit was by Indira Gandhi in June 1983, followed by Austrian Chancellor Fred Sinowatz's visit in 1984. President Pratibha Devisingh Patil visited Austria in October 2011. In June 2017, Prime Minister Modi met Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern at the SPIEF in St. Petersburg. He also had telephonic conversations with President Alexander Van der Bellen in May 2020 and met Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg in October 2021 at COP-26 in Glasgow.\n\nBilateral trade has shown consistent growth, with trade volume reaching USD 2.93 billion in FY 2023-24. Indian exports to Austria amounted to USD 1.52 billion, while imports were USD 1.41 billion.\n\nThe 16th session of the Joint Economic Cooperation was held in June 2023.

There are over, I think, 30 to 40 large Austrian companies already present in India in a range of areas from infrastructure, tunnelling, and track laying.

EXPLAINED", "body": "PM Modi in Austria: Prime Minister Narendra Modi kick-started his two-day visit to Austria, and his arrival is touted as historic as he is the first Indian leader to visit the European country in more than four decades. His visit comes in the wake of India and Austria celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations and he was accorded a warm welcome by Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.\n\nPM Modi's visit to Austria is significant as both sides will hold formal talks to explore ways to further deepen their bilateral relationship and closer cooperation on the many geopolitical challenges. Ahead of his visit, PM Modi said the shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law form the bedrock upon which the two countries will build an ever-closer partnership.\n\nThe Indian leader was welcomed by Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg at the airport and shared a bear hug and a selfie with Nehammer. He was also accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Federal Chancellory and the Indian diaspora in Austria came out in great numbers to greet the Indian leader.\n\nIndia and Austria established diplomatic relations in 1949 and New Delhi intervened in favour of Austria during its negotiations with the Soviet Union in 1953 on the State Treaty of Austria that saw the country's independence from Germany in 1955. Late former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi last visited Austria in 1983, marking 41 years since any Indian leader visited the country.\n\nHowever, India and Austria have had regular exchanges of visits, including at the level of leaders, ministers and parliamentarians highlighting the importance of both sides in further strengthening their relations. First PM Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Indian leader to visit Austria in 1955, followed by Indira Gandhi in 1971. Former Austrian Chancellors Bruno Kreisky and Fred Sinowatz visited India in 1980 and 1984 respectively.\n\nThen-Austrian President Heinz Fischer visited India in 2005, followed by Indian ex-President Pratibha Patil's visit to the country in 2011. PM Modi, while on his first trip to Vienna, held a telephonic conversation with current Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen on May 2020, where the leaders discussed measures to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPM Modi also held a bilateral meeting with former Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg in 2021 on the sidelines of the COP26 in Glasgow. Prior to that, he also held a bilateral meeting with then-Austrian chancellor Christian Kern in St Petersburg on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum.\n\nPM Modi will call on Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and will hold delegation-level talks with Nehammer to focus on \"upgrading bilateral partnership to address challenges of the future\". The talks will focus on exploring ways to further deepen the India-Austria bilateral relationship and foster closer cooperation on the many geopolitical challenges.\n\nPM Modi and Nehammer will also hold talks with business leaders from both countries. The Indian leader also received a ceremonial Guard of Honour ahead of talks at the Federal Chancellory in Vienna. Earlier, Australian artists welcomed Modi with a rendition of Vande Mataram. The choir and orchestra were led by Lucknow-led Vijay Upadhyaya.", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In 1983, Indira Gandhi was the last Prime Minister to visit the country.\n\nModi was welcomed at the airport by Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg. He then met members of the Indian diaspora and was received by Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer for a private meeting.\n\nDuring his visit, Modi will meet Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen and also hold talks with Chancellor Karl Nehammer. The prime minister and the chancellor will also address Indian and Austrian business leaders, according to PTI.\n\nOn Sunday, ahead of his visit to Austria, Modi said the shared values of democracy, freedom and the rule of law form the foundation on which the two countries will build an ever closer partnership.\n\nHis remarks came a day after Austrian Chancellor Nehammer posted on \"X\": \"I am really looking forward to welcoming Narendra Modi, the Prime Minister of India, the largest democracy in the world, next week in Vienna.\"\n\n\"This visit is a special honour as it marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in over 40 years and an important milestone as we celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations with India,\" he said.\n\n\"We will have the opportunity to discuss the deepening of our bilateral relations and closer cooperation on the many geopolitical challenges,\" said the Austrian Chancellor.\n\nIn response, Modi said: \"Thank you, Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

It was his first trip to the country since the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDuring Modi's two-day visit to Russia, New Delhi and Moscow signed nine MoUs and agreements in several sectors including trade, climate and research.\n\nAccording to the list of agreements and memoranda of understanding issued by the Ministry of External Affairs, India and Russia have agreed on a programme of bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade, economy and investment in the Russian Far East for the period 2024-2029. The two countries have also agreed on the principles of cooperation in the Arctic zone of the Russian Federation. These initiatives have been undertaken to strengthen trade and joint investment projects between the Far East region of Russia and India.\n\nDuring his visit, Prime Minister Modi also hailed India's ties with Russia, calling the country an \"all-weather friend\" of India and lauding President Putin for strengthening bilateral relations over the last two decades.\n\nModi also met with Russian President Putin in the Kremlin, where he reiterated India's commitment to peace and its willingness to help end the conflict in Ukraine.\n\nModi said the killing of innocent children is heartbreaking and very painful, a day after a suspected Russian missile hit a children's hospital in kyiv, triggering global outrage.\n\n\"Let's take war, any conflict or terrorist act: anyone who believes in humanity feels pain when people die, and especially when innocent children die. When we feel such pain, our hearts explode, and I had the opportunity to talk about these issues with you yesterday,\" Modi told Putin.\n\nModi was also awarded the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle the First-Called, Russia's highest civilian honour, by President Putin.

I look forward to our discussions on strengthening the bonds between our nations and exploring new avenues of cooperation.\"\n\nThe relations between Austria and India go back in time and have been of strategic, diplomatic and economic importance. For India, the nation is a key component in Central Europe, which has always provided opportunities in sectors as diverse as infrastructure, renewable energy, technology, start-ups, and culture.\n\nSignifying this strong bond, just a few months ago, both the countries started a India-Austria Startup Bridge, aimed to increase collaboration and knowledge sharing between startups in both the countries.\n\nAustria recognised India's independence in 1947 and the two established diplomatic relations in 1949. The start can be traced to May 1949 when India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru met Austria's first post-World War II Chancellor Leopold Figl.\n\nSince then both the countries have had strong relations. India, for example, intervened in June 1953 in Austria's favour during negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Austrian State Treaty. India also supported Austria at the UN-South Tyrol conventions.\n\nThe main institutional mechanism at the governmental level between India and Austria are the Foreign Office Consultations (FOC) and the Joint Economic Commission (JEC).\n\nIn recent times as well, bilateral trade between India and Austria has consistently grown.\n\nAccording to the Austrian National Bank, India has received cumulative direct investment of 733 million Euros in 2023. Cumulative FDI from India to Austria has reached about Euro 1.159 billion Euros in 2023.\n\nIndia exports electronics, textiles, apparel, footwear and chemicals to Austria. Vienna in its turn sends machinery, automotive parts, and chemicals to India.\n\nThe bond extends in various spheres. Austria's first two satellites, TUGSAT-1 and UniBRITE-1, for example, were launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 2013. Cultural ties between the two countries also exist as does a healthy diaspora. The visit by Prime Minister Modi is only expected to strengthen this tie and result in a growth in trade and increased diplomatic relations.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news",

Several Austrian companies are present in India. In February 2024, a start-up bridge between India and Austria was also launched, which has already had a very promising start. India and Austria have also signed a comprehensive agreement on migration and mobility,\" said Kwatra.\n\nPavan Kapoor, Secretary of State (West) in the Ministry of External Affairs, said: \"We have a 'good and strong' relationship with Austria. We will focus on innovation and technology.\"\n\nIndia and Austria subsequently established diplomatic relations in 1949.\n\nIn 1955, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru visited Austria.\n\nThe Congress on Tuesday highlighted the major role played by India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru in the 1950s in the emergence of a sovereign and neutral Austria.\n\nCongress General Secretary, Communications, Jairam Ramesh wrote: \"Dr Hans Kochler, a noted Austrian scholar, has written about the key role played by Jawaharlal Nehru in the early fifties in the emergence of a sovereign and neutral Austria after a decade of occupation by the victorious powers of World War II,\" Ramesh said.\n\n\"One of Nehru's most ardent admirers worldwide was the legendary Bruno Kreisky, who was Chancellor of Austria from 1970 to 1983,\" he said.\n\n\"In 1989, Dr. Kreisky spoke of Nehru in these words: 'When the history of this century is written, and of the men who have left their mark on it, one of the greatest and most beautiful chapters will be the story of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. It will be part of the most modern history of India... Nehru became one of my teachers at an early age.'\n\nIn 1980, the then Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky visited India.\n\nThis trip was followed by a visit to Austria by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1983.\n\nIndira's trip in 1983 was followed by a visit by then-Chancellor Fred Sinowatz in 1984.\n\nAlthough there has been no visit by an Indian Prime Minister since Indira Gandhi's visit, there have been a series of presidential-level visits to Austria.\n\nThen President KR Narayanan visited Austria in 1999, then President Heinz Fischer in 2005, then Vice Chancellor Josef Proll in 2010 and then President Pratibha Devisingh Patil in 2011, according to the profile on the MEA website.\n\nIndia and Austria have had regular exchange of visits, including at the level of leaders, ministers and parliamentarians, underlining the importance the two countries attach to strengthening their relations, according to a profile of India-Austria bilateral relations published on the website of the Ministry of External Affairs.\n\nIndia exports electronics, textiles, garments, footwear and chemicals to Austria.\n\nMeanwhile, Vienna is sending machinery, car parts and chemicals to India.\n\nForeign Minister Vinay Kwatra said Austria offers \"excellent opportunities\" for bilateral cooperation in infrastructure, renewable energy, high-tech fields, start-up sectors, media and entertainment.\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar visited Austria from December 31, 2022 to January 3, 2023.\n\nDuring his visit, he met with Austrian Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen, Chancellor Karl Nehammer and National Council President Wolfgang Sobotka.\n\nHe held talks at delegation level with Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg.\n\nFive agreements were also signed during the visit, according to the profile of bilateral relations dated June 2023.\n\nDuring Austrian Foreign Minister Schallenberg's visit to India in 2022, the two ministers had discussed \"the entire range of bilateral relations, including political, economic, commercial and consular ties\".\n\nAccording to Financial Express, India and Austria have had cultural exchanges dating back to the 16th century.\n\n\"The visit of Indian philosopher-poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore twice to Vienna in 1921 and 1926 was one of the crucial bridges of cultural and intellectual exchange between India and Austria,\" the MEA website says.\n\nAustria is known for its rich cultural and architectural heritage, with Vienna renowned for its legacy of orchestral music and legendary composers.\n\nAccording to the MEA, around 31,000 Indians live in Austria, the majority of them from Kerala and Punjab.\n\nThe Indian diaspora mainly comprises professionals working mainly in the health sector and in the United Nations multilateral agencies, businessmen and self-employed people.\n\nThey are roughly evenly split between NRIs and PIOs.\n\nMore than 500 Indian students are pursuing their higher studies in Austria, the MEA added.\n\nThe Indian diaspora expressed happiness over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Austria and said it was a matter of pride that an Indian Prime Minister was visiting the country after 40 years.\n\nTalk with YEARSSamir, who hails from Maharashtra, said: \"It is great that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is coming here. As far as I know, it has been 40 years since an Indian Prime Minister visited this country. And I think it would be a good initiative for cultural and economic ties between the two nations. I am looking forward to seeing him here.\"\n\nGaurav, who hails from Punjab and has been residing in Vienna for the past 12 years, said: \"PM Modi is coming here and I am really happy. My eyes are eager to see him. After 40 years, an Indian Prime Minister is coming to Austria. It feels good and tomorrow we will be even more eager to see him.\"\n\nAmarjeet from Chandigarh said it was a significant event that an Indian Prime Minister was arriving here after 40 years. \"I have been here for 23 years. It is a good feeling. The Indian population, which is around 30,000 to 35,000, is feeling good. Those who will be able to see Prime Minister Modi will be lucky,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

To connect the youth and ideas of both countries, the start-up bridge will be accelerated.\n\nAn agreement on mobility and migration partnership has already been reached. Exchanges between cultural and educational institutions will be promoted,\" he added.\n\nThe two leaders also shared their thoughts on climate change and terrorism. PM Modi said he has invited Austria to join the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and the Biofuel Alliance.\n\nBoth strongly condemned terrorism. \"We agree that it is unacceptable in any form and cannot be justified in any way. We agree on the need for reforms in the United Nations and other international institutions to make them more contemporary and effective,\" the PM said.\n\nPM Modi also said that he is happy to visit Austria at the very beginning of his third term in office.\n\n\"This visit of mine is both historic and special. After forty-one years, an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria. It is also a pleasant coincidence that this visit is taking place as our bilateral relations complete 75 years.\"\n\nHe extended best wishes to Chancellor Nehammer and the people of Austria for the upcoming elections in the country.\n\nThe Austrian Chancellor, in his remarks, said that Austria shares very good relations with India, based on trust.\n\nHe said he had \"very intensive discussions on the Russian aggression on Ukraine\" and that \"it is important for us to know India's viewpoint and to understand it and familiarise India with the European concerns and worries\".\n\n\"What unites India and Austria is concern over the development of the geopolitical situation,\" he added.\n\nNehammer said that Austria has delivered $250 bn in aid to Ukraine.\n\nHe said the two leaders had discussed the unique position of the Global South and India's role in highlighting the issues of the Global South.\n\n\"India's role for Austria is more than important when it comes to the peace process and the future peace summit and Austria will be available for dialogue,\" he said, adding that it will be as a member, and not part of NATO.\n\nUNI RN", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com",

The two sides also discussed ways to bolster cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, science and technology, green energy, and climate change.\n\nModi repeated the message he conveyed to Russian President Vladimir Putin in televised remarks at the Kremlin on Tuesday - peace talks under the shadow of guns can't succeed and parties to the conflict need to return to dialogue.

We are both ready to provide every possible cooperation to achieve this,\" he said.\n\nIndia and Austria, Nehammer said, are united by concerns over the geopolitical situation and the two leaders had \"very intensive talks about the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine\". Pointing to Modi's just concluded visit to Russia, Nehammer said: \"It was particularly important for me to hear about the Prime Minister's personal assessment regarding the intentions of Russia in respect of the peace process.\"\n\nNehammer said it was an \"important signal\" that India participated in the recent peace summit on Ukraine hosted by Switzerland and the two sides had discussed \"possibilities of reviving the peace process\".

A blueprint for cooperation over the coming decades won't be limited to economic cooperation, and the two sides will combine strengths in areas such as infrastructure development, innovation, renewable energy, water and waste management and quantum technology, he said.\n\nA mobility and migration agreement signed by the two sides in 2023 will facilitate legal migration and movement of skilled workforce, he added.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi's Russia visit: Ukraine war on agenda for talks with President Putin\n\nWith two-way trade currently worth 2.7 billion euro, Nehammer emphasised the scope for expanding economic cooperation,. He said more than 150 Austrian businesses currently operate in India and the number is expected to increase, he said.\n\nNehammer also highlighted the role of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in negotiations that led to a treaty between the Soviet Union, the UK, the US and France in May 1955 to grant Austria independence and to facilitate withdrawal of occupation forces. The Austrian State Treaty was signed by the four parties with the understanding that the independent state of Austria would remain neutral, acting as a buffer zone between the East and the West.\n\n\"There was a standstill in 1953...It was difficult to make progress with the Soviet Union, and it was [Austrian] foreign minister [Karl] Gruber who contacted Prime Minister Nehru, asking for support in the negotiations to bring them to a positive conclusion. This is what happened - India helped Austria and in 1955, the negotiations came to a positive conclusion with the Austrian State Treaty,\" he said.\n\nModi invited Austria to join India's initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and Biofuel Alliance. \"We both strongly condemn terrorism. We agree that it is unacceptable in any form and cannot be justified in any way,\" he said.\n\nFollowing their talks, Nehammer and Modi jointly addressed CEOs of the two sides at a business roundtable in Hofburg Palace. Modi highlighted the potential for collaboration between Indian and Austrian companies in sectors such as infrastructure, renewable energy, new and emerging technologies, fintech, start-ups and innovation. He also invited Austrian companies to invest in India.\n\nOn his arrival in Vienna on Tuesday, Modi was received by foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg at the airport. He was also hosted by Nehammer for a private meeting.

PM Modi and myself discussed the unique position of India in the so-called Global South,\" the Austrian Chancellor said.\n\n\"India is an important, influential and credit-worthy country. India is the biggest democracy in the world. Therefore, India's role, especially for Austria, is more than important when it comes to the peace process and future peace summits. As a reliable partner, Austria will be available as a site for dialogue, making use of its unique position as a neutral country - a member of the EU but not a member of NATO\" Nehammer said.\n\nFurther, Nehammer said that it was important for him to hear about PM Modi's personal assessment of Russia's intentions in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Before his visit to Austria, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to the Russian President. Therefore, it was particularly important for me to hear about the Prime Minister's personal assessment regarding the intentions of Russia in respect of the peace progress. Our shared objective is to achieve a comprehensive, just and permanent peace in line with the UN Charter,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian Chancellor further said that his cabinet has been in constant contact with the European Union.\n\n\"Yesterday, I talked to Charles Michel (President of the European Council) on the telephone about potential perspectives and issues in this context. What is particularly important, is the support of EU for a free and prospering Ukraine. Austria is making a substantial contribution. We are supporting the policy of the EU on the one hand, but on the other hand we have also delivered 250 Million Euro in bilateral aid,\" Nehammer said.\n\nNotably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983. PM Modi's visit to Austria comes after his two-day official visit to Russia, where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPM Modi's visit to Austria also comes at a time when the two countries are marking 75 years of diplomatic relations.

Wherever it is, the killings of innocent people are not acceptable,\" he said at a joint press interaction with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer after wide-ranging talks between the two leaders in Vienna.\n\nMr Modi, who arrived in Vienna last night on a two-day visit to Austria, said he had discussed with Chancellor Nehammer in detail the conflict in Ukraine as well as the situation in West Asia, apart from other global developments and bilateral issues.\n\nHe said there were discussions also on the challenges like climate change and terrorism. On climate, he said India has invited Austria to join initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Global Biofuels Alliance. \"We are both opposed to terrorism and we agree that the menace in any form is not acceptable. It can't be justified in any manner,\" he said.\n\nThe PM said the two countries also emphasised the need for reforms in the United Nations and other international institutions to make them more contemporary and effective.\n\nMr Modi said he was happy that during the beginning of his third term in office, he got an opportunity to visit Austria. \"This trip of mine is historic and special. After 41 years, an Indian PM has visited Austria. We discussed new possibilities to strengthen our ties further. We have decided to give these ties a strategic direction in sectors like infrastructure development, renewable energy, hydrogen, water and waste management, and artificial intelligence. We will work towards linking each other's capabilities,\" he said. An agreement has already been reached on mobility and migration partnership. It will help in legal migration and movement of skilled workforce. The exchange between cultural and educational institutions will also be promoted, he said.\n\nThe Austrian Chancellor noted that before arriving in his country, PM Modi paid a visit to Moscow. \"Therefore, it was particularly important for me to hear about the Prime Minister's personal assessment regarding the intentions of Russia in respect of the peace process. Our shared objective is to achieve a comprehensive, just and permanent peace in line with the UN Charter. My Cabinet has been in constant contact with the EU,\" he said.\n\nHe said that for him it was an important signal that India, as a founding member of the BRICS, participated in the Swiss Peace Summit on Ukraine. \"Today, we have been talking about an even stronger commitment and about the possibilities of reviving the peace process. PM Modi and myself discussed the unique position of India in the so-called Global South. India is an important, influential and credit-worthy country. India is the biggest democracy in the world. Therefore, India's role, especially for Austria, is more than important when it comes to the peace process and future peace summits. As a reliable partner, Austria will be available as a site for dialogue, making use of its unique position as a neutral country - a member of the EU but not a member of NATO.\" he added.\n\nEarlier, the PM was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the Federal Chancery as he began his landmark visit to Austria.\n\nScripting a new chapter in bilateral relations, he was warmly received by Chancellor Nehammer who had last week called the Indian PM's visit to Vienna as a \"special honour\".\n\nThe Austrian Chancellor hosted PM Modi for a private engagement as the Indian PM arrived from Moscow on Tuesday evening.

PM Modi and I examined India's unique position in the Global South,' Nehammer stated. 'India, the world's largest democracy, holds significant influence, especially for Austria, concerning peace processes and future summits. Austria, as a neutral EU member, offers a venue for dialogue.'\n\nNehammer expressed interest in PM Modi's assessment of Russia's intentions. 'Prior to Austria, PM Modi visited Russian President Vladimir Putin. His insights on Russia's intention are crucial for our mutual objective of achieving comprehensive, just, and lasting peace, in line with the UN Charter,' he said.\n\nNehammer added that Austria maintains constant communication with the European Union. 'I spoke with Charles Michel, President of the European Council, about our perspectives. It's vital for the EU to support a free and prosperous Ukraine. Austria is contributing substantially, including 250 million euros in bilateral aid,' he noted.\n\nPM Modi's visit to Austria is the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 41 years since Indira Gandhi in 1983. The visit follows Modi's two-day official trip to Russia, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of India-Austria diplomatic relations.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Nehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Austria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli\u2013Palestinian_peace_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Michel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Michel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indira_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indira Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Conferences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/10_07_2024_20_08_49_1272763.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717811", "eventUri": "eng-9717811", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

PM Modi and myself discussed the unique position of India in the so-called Global South,\" the Austrian Chancellor said.\n\n\"India is an important, influential and credit-worthy country. India is the biggest democracy in the world. Therefore, India's role, especially for Austria, is more than important when it comes to the peace process and future peace summits. As a reliable partner, Austria will be available as a site for dialogue, making use of its unique position as a neutral country - a member of the EU but not a member of NATO\" Nehammer said.\n\nFurther, Nehammer said that it was important for him to hear about PM Modi's personal assessment of Russia's intentions in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\n\"Before his visit to Austria, Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to the Russian President. Therefore, it was particularly important for me to hear about the Prime Minister's personal assessment regarding the intentions of Russia in respect of the peace progress. Our shared objective is to achieve a comprehensive, just and permanent peace in line with the UN Charter,\" he said.\n\nThe Austrian Chancellor further said that his cabinet has been in constant contact with the European Union.\n\n\"Yesterday, I talked to Charles Michel (President of the European Council) on the telephone about potential perspectives and issues in this context. What is particularly important, is the support of EU for a free and prospering Ukraine. Austria is making a substantial contribution. We are supporting the policy of the EU on the one hand, but on the other hand we have also delivered 250 Million Euro in bilateral aid,\" Nehammer said.\n\nNotably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983. PM Modi's visit to Austria comes after his two-day official visit to Russia, where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPM Modi's visit to Austria also comes at a time when the two countries are marking 75 years of diplomatic relations.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by Newsx staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "newsx.com",

I have said before that this is not a time for war. Problems cannot be solved on the battlefield. The loss of innocent lives, anywhere, is unacceptable,\" Modi said in a joint press statement along with Chancellor Nehammer after their talks.\n\nHe said India and Austria emphasise on dialogue and diplomacy for the earliest possible restoration of peace and stability.\n\n\"We are both ready to provide every possible cooperation to achieve this,\" he said, recalling that the historic Vienna Congress was hosted in the hall where they are standing and that the conference provided direction for peace and stability in Europe.\n\nOn his part, Nehammer said India is an influential and credit-worthy country whose role is more than important when it comes to the Russia-Ukraine peace process.\n\n\"We had very intensive talks about the Russian aggression against Ukraine. For me as the Federal Chancellor of Austria, it is particularly important to get to know India's assessment and to understand it and to familiarise India with European concerns and worries,\" said Nehammer, whose country is an ally of Ukraine.\n\n\"Moreover, the conflict in the Middle East was a major topic,\" he added.\n\nDuring his talks with Putin on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi told him that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace efforts do not succeed amid bombs and bullets.\n\nNehammer said as a reliable partner, Austria will be available as a site for dialogue, making use of its unique position as a neutral country, a member of the European Union but not a member of NATO. \"As such Austria is willing to act as a bridge builder and to contribute towards the achievement of a peaceful solution,\" he said.\n\nModi said he was happy that he got the opportunity to visit Austria at the very beginning of his third term. \"This visit of mine is both historic and special. After 41 years, an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria. It is also a pleasant coincidence that this visit is taking place as our bilateral relations complete 75 years,\" Modi said.\n\nHe said shared belief in values such as democracy and the rule of law forms the strong foundation of our relationship. \"Mutual trust and shared interests strengthen our ties,\" he added.\n\n\"Today, Chancellor Nehammer and I had very fruitful discussions. We have identified new opportunities to further strengthen our cooperation. We have decided to provide strategic direction to our relationship. A blueprint for cooperation over the coming decades has been prepared. This is not limited to economic cooperation and investment alone,\" Modi said.\n\n\"We will work to combine our strengths in areas such as infrastructure development, innovation, renewable energy, hydrogen, water and waste management, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology. To connect the youth and ideas of both countries, the start-up bridge will be accelerated,\" he said.\n\nStating that an agreement on mobility and migration partnership has already been reached, the prime minister said this will facilitate legal migration and the movement of skilled workforce.\n\n\"Today, we also shared our thoughts on challenges faced by humanity, such as climate change and terrorism. Regarding climate, we invite Austria to join our initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, and the Biofuel Alliance,\" he said.\n\n\"We both strongly condemn terrorism. We agree that it is unacceptable in any form and cannot be justified in any way,\" he said.\n\nModi said the two sides agreed on the need for reforms in the United Nations and other international institutions to make them more contemporary and effective.", "source": {"uri": "dtnext.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "dtNext.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Pointing to Modi's just concluded visit to Russia, Nehammer said: \"It was particularly important for me to hear about the prime minister's personal assessment regarding the intentions of Russia in respect of the peace process.\"\n\nNehammer said it was an \"important signal\" that India participated in the recent peace summit on Ukraine hosted by Switzerland and the two sides had discussed \"possibilities of reviving the peace process\".

A blueprint for cooperation over the coming decades won't be limited to economic cooperation, and the two sides will combine strengths in areas such as infrastructure development, innovation, renewable energy, water and waste management and quantum technology, he said.\n\nA mobility and migration agreement signed by the two sides in 2023 will facilitate legal migration and movement of skilled workforce, he added.\n\nWith two-way trade currently worth 2.7 billion euro, Nehammer emphasised the scope for expanding economic cooperation,. He said more than 150 Austrian businesses currently operate in India and the number is expected to increase, he said.\n\nNehammer also highlighted the role of India's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in negotiations that led to a treaty between the Soviet Union, the UK, the US and France in May 1955 to grant Austria independence and to facilitate withdrawal of occupation forces. The Austrian State Treaty was signed by the four parties with the understanding that the independent state of Austria would remain neutral, acting as a buffer zone between the East and the West.\n\n\"There was a standstill in 1953...It was difficult to make progress with the Soviet Union, and it was [Austrian] foreign minister [Karl] Gruber who contacted Prime Minister Nehru, asking for support in the negotiations to bring them to a positive conclusion. This is what happened - India helped Austria and in 1955, the negotiations came to a positive conclusion with the Austrian State Treaty,\" he said.\n\nModi invited Austria to join India's initiatives such as the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and Biofuel Alliance. \"We both strongly condemn terrorism. We agree that it is unacceptable in any form and cannot be justified in any way,\" he said.\n\nFollowing their talks, Nehammer and Modi jointly addressed CEOs of the two sides at a business roundtable in Hofburg Palace. Modi highlighted the potential for collaboration between Indian and Austrian companies in sectors such as infrastructure, renewable energy, new and emerging technologies, fintech, start-ups and innovation. He also invited Austrian companies to invest in India.\n\nOn his arrival in Vienna on Tuesday, Modi was received by foreign minister Alexander Schallenberg at the airport. He was also hosted by Nehammer for a private meeting.

In the video, PM Modi can be seen applauding the artists after they performed in front of him.\n\nWhile sharing the video on X, PM Modi stated, \"Austria is known for its vibrant musical culture. I got a glimpse of it thanks to this amazing rendition of Vande Mataram!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Grammy Award winner Ricky Kej praised the Indian composer Vijay Upadhyaya, who performed the rendition of 'Vande Mataram.'\n\n\"The conductor is an Indian who makes all of us proud - Vijay Upadhyaya, originally from Lucknow. He is the director of the prestigious Vienna University Philharmonic (among other international orchestras) and founded the India National Youth Orchestra. He is a proud Indian and often conducts Indian-styled music internationally,\" he posted on X.\n\nAfter landing in Austria, PM Modi arrived at the hotel Ritz-Carlton in Vienna and greeted members of the Indian diaspora.

I really enjoyed it. It's a big honour for me. It's a huge honour. I did prepare quite a lot. With the orchestra, we prepared for a few days. But, also at home, I had to really give my best because this is a huge opportunity for Austria, for us, for our orchestra. It was an amazing experience.\"\n\nAsked about his interaction with PM Modi, he said, \"It was amazing. You can really see that he cares for the people. And I really noticed that feeling.

I came to this college in Austria and I am now directing the music department at Vienna University.\"\n\n\"The first thing I did was to find out what to do two weeks ago. In Western music, the orchestra or the singers have to write everything down. So first I had to write it down in two days, then I had to rehearse it. We decided to perform 'Vande Mataram' in Austria-European Symphony style. A choir and an orchestra with a total of 50 members performed in front of PM Modi,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking about his interaction with PM Modi, Upadhyay said, \"We should think that PM Modi is also a human being. He came from Russia. He must have been tired but he has so much energy. I wonder where he got it from. I told him I was from Lucknow and he said he is from Uttar Pradesh. I have been here for so many years, but I should keep my civilization. So, my contact with PM Modi.\"\n\nAntonia, an Austrian artist from the choir and orchestra, called it an \"enormous experience\" to have played the song in front of him.\n\n[{f8bf84a3-304a-4038-b30a-ac234897b1d4:intradmin/ANI-20240710034321.jpg}]\n\n\"It was an enormous experience. I never played in front of such a big honoured person. So it was a little bit crazy actually because there are so many famous people here. So, that we can play in front of them is just fantastic. I think we prepared like two weeks or something. So, Vijay wrote the song for us and then we chatted about some rehearsals and then we did this in like, yeah, two weeks or something,\" Antonia told ANI.\n\nAsked about PM Modi's reaction while the orchestra was performing, she responded, \"He looked at us with such big eyes and I also saw a little smile on his face and that was a really beautiful moment for us.\"\n\nShe said that PM Modi also interacted with the orchestra members and called him a friendly person.\n\nSpeaking about her interaction with PM Modi, Antonia said, \"He was really friendly.

Prime Minister Modi and myself discussed the unique position of India in the so-called Global South. India is an important, influential and credit-worthy country.\"\n\nThe first visit by an Indian prime minister to Austria in 41 years came a day after Modi met with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow, where he reiterated his call for peace, declaring that a solution between Russia and Ukraine cannot be \"found on the battlefield\".\n\nIn his statement to the press Wednesday in Vienna, the Indian prime minister emphasised his stance, pointing out that the building, where the press statements were being given, was the very hall where the \"Congress of Vienna gave a direction of peace to Europe\".\n\n\"This hall where we are standing is very historic. In the 19th century, the historic Vienna Congress was hosted here. That conference provided direction for peace and stability in Europe... I have said before that this is not a time for war. Problems cannot be solved on the battlefield. The loss of innocent lives, anywhere, is unacceptable,\" said Modi during his statement to the press.\n\nModi's flight to Vienna from Moscow was also one of the few to make the direct trip from Russia to Western Europe, since the \"special military operation\" against Ukraine began. Moscow has since been heavily sanctioned by European countries, and has found itself outside of the international financial framework with barred access to its markets.\n\nAustria, while a member of the European Union (EU), is not a member of the Western-led military alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), which was created 75 years ago to balance against the USSR.\n\nNehammer recalled how this neutrality had come to be and India's role in it. He explained that in 1953, after the end of World War II, the Allied powers (US, UK, France and the USSR), which occupied Austria, had come to a standstill on the future of the country.\n\n\"The situation was difficult, it was difficult to make progress. It was [Austrian] Foreign Minister [Karl] Gruber, who contacted Prime Minister [Jawaharlal] Nehru, asking for support in the negotiations to bring them to a positive conclusion. This is what happened. India helped Austria and the negotiations came to a positive conclusion with the Austrian State Treaty,\" explained Nehammer.\n\nAfter the last Allied troops left the country in 1955, the Austrian Parliament declared itself a neutral country -- a stance, Nehammer highlighted, it could play to help bring peace to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nAlso Read: Modi wraps up visit to Russia with emphasis on peace, inks 9 bilateral agreements\n\nModi said that after this visit, a \"strategic direction\" has been given to India-Austria ties. The two leaders also highlighted the different areas of discussions, including the sectors of trade and investment, green energy, science and technology, artificial intelligence, the environment and climate change.\n\n\"It is particularly important for Austria, a strongly export-oriented country, to find new forms of economic cooperation. There are excellent economic and trade relations with India. EUR 2.7 billion is the current trade volume. More than 150 Austrian businesses are operating in India and we expect the number to increase,\" said Nehammer.\n\nThe Austrian chancellor added, \"There is high demand for economic cooperation, particularly when it comes to renewable energy and environment, urban development and infrastructure development.\"\n\nAustria is the second country Modi has visited for bilateral talks so far after Russia in his third term as prime minister.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keshav_padmanabhan@theprint.in", "name": "Keshav

The visit holds special significance as it marks several decades since an Indian Prime Minister last visited Austria, coinciding with the 75th anniversary of diplomatic relations between the two nations.\n\nNotably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983.\n\nRecognising the significance of tourism in generating economic, sustainable and inclusive growth, both nations encouraged efforts by relevant agencies to work together to expand tourist flows in both directions, including by expanding direct flight connectivity, the lengths of stay and other initiatives, an official release by the PMO said.\n\nAppreciating the tradition of cultural exchanges, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer and PM Modi also noted the growing interest among Austrians in yoga as well as Ayurveda. The press release informed that the nations welcomed efforts to promote bilateral cultural ties in music, dance, opera, theatre, films, literature, sports and other fields, including in the framework of the recently signed MoU on Cultural Cooperation.\n\nBoth the leaders also recognised the importance of skill development along with the mobility of skilled personnel to support an expanded engagement in high-tech sectors.\n\nIn this regard, both the leaders welcomed the operationalisation of the bilateral Migration and Mobility Agreement, which provides an institutional framework to facilitate such exchanges, while at the same time combating irregular migration, the PMO said.\n\nDuring the meeting, the leaders also encouraged the academic institutions of both countries.to build future-oriented partnerships focused on sectors like science, technology, and engineering.\n\nNotably, PM Modi held significant meetings with Austrian leaders, including Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Nehammer, to bolster bilateral cooperation and explore new avenues for collaboration between India and Austria.\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Prime Minister Modi shared insights into his discussions and engagements. \"Had a very good meeting with Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen and discussed ways to expand India-Austria cooperation,\" he stated, noting the positive outcome of their conversation.\n\nPrime Minister Modi also highlighted his interaction with business leaders from both countries. \"Met business leaders from India and Austria. Our nations are confident of leveraging the many opportunities ahead to boost commercial and trade linkages,\" he said, underlining the mutual confidence in enhancing economic ties.

I got a glimpse of it thanks to this amazing rendition of Vande Mataram,\" PM Modi tweeted.\n\nThe choir and orchestra, consisting of 50 members, were conducted by Vijay Upadhyay, the Indian director of the Department of Music at the University of Vienna.\n\nUpadhyay, who also founded the India National Youth Orchestra, described the preparations for the performance as hectic, with less than three weeks' notice.\n\n\"We decided to perform Vande Mataram\u00e2\u0080\u00e6 First I wrote [the score] in 2 days and then rehearsals began,\" he said.\n\nUpadhyay said that they tried to maintain the essence of 'Vande Mataram' while incorporating an Austrian-European symphonic style.\n\nAfter the performance, Upadhyay had a chance to interact with PM Modi, whom he found to be energetic coming right off a two-day visit to Russia packed with back-to-back engagements.\n\nRecounting his conversation with the Indian leader, Upadhyay said, \"I told him I'm from Lucknow, he said I'm also from Uttar Pradesh.\"\n\nPM Modi's historic visit to Austria aims to strengthen the relationship between the two countries and explore ways to address various geopolitical challenges. He will meet with the President of the Republic of Austria, Alexander Van der Bellen, and hold talks with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.\n\nThe Prime Minister and the Chancellor will also address business leaders from India and Austria.\n\nIn a statement ahead of his visit, PM Modi said that the shared values of democracy, freedom, and the rule of law form the foundation for building a closer partnership between India and Austria.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vande_Mataram", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vande Mataram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Vienna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Vienna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl Nehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Van_der_Bellen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Van der Bellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Austria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lucknow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/vande-mataram-modi-100205794-16x9_0.png?VersionId=xZgUmN3KKTufoEq5s01Lhhs9.sX90Day", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717811", "eventUri": "eng-9717811", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Nehammer's remarks came during his joint press statement with visiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi after their formal talks. Nehammer said he discussed with Modi the conflict in Ukraine. Prime Minister Modi arrived here after holding several rounds of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n\n\"We had very intensive talks about the Russian aggression against Ukraine. For me as the Federal Chancellor of Austria, it is particularly important to get to know India's assessment and to understand it and to familiarise India with European concerns and worries,\" he said. \"Moreover, the conflict in the Middle East was a major topic,\" he added.

During his talks with Putin on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi told him that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace efforts do not succeed amid bombs and bullets. \"Our shared objective is to achieve a comprehensive, just and permanent peace in line with the UN Charter,\" he said.\n\nHe said India's participation as a founding member of a BRICS organisation in the Swiss peace summit in June over Russia-UKraine was an important signal. \"And today, we've been talking about an even stronger commitment and the possibilities of reviving the peace process.\" \"Prime Minister Modi and myself discussed the unique position of India in the so-called Global South. India is an important, influential and credit-worthy country. India is the biggest democracy in the world. And therefore, India's role, especially for Austria, is more than important when it comes to the peace process and future peace summits,\" he said.\n\nNehammer said as a reliable partner, Austria will be available as a site for dialogue, making use of its unique position as a neutral country, a member of the European Union but not a member of NATO. \"As such Austria is willing to act as a bridge builder and to contribute towards the achievement of a peaceful solution,\" he said.\n\n(With inputs from agency)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ajit_kumar@indiatvnews.com", "name": "Ajit Kumar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Nehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Austria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neutral country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_Cooperation_Organisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Cooperation Organisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charter of the United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Automobile_Buying_and_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Automobile Buying and Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://resize.indiatvnews.com/en/resize/newbucket/1200_-/2024/07/PTI07_10_2024_000168B.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717811", "eventUri": "eng-9717811", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

This is the first visit by any Indian prime minister to Austria after a long gap of four decades. It was former prime minister Indira Gandhi who last visited Austria in 1983.\n\nThis visit is well-timed because the year 2024 also marks the 75th anniversary of India and Austria establishing diplomatic relations.\n\nBut there's more to be said about the timing.\n\nPrime Minister Modi's visit has come just after his two-day visit to Russia to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAustria, although being a member of the European Union, is not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). India and Austria have maintained a history of good relations with minimal points of divergence.\n\nHere's where it gets interesting: Unlike other European states, Austria is not entirely anti-Russia and is sympathetic towards India's attempt for peace due to its permanent neutral status which is enshrined in its constitution.\n\nThe law states that Austria shall not join any military alliance at all and maintain permanent neutrality. It is perhaps this that led to Prime Minister Modi going to Austria just after concluding his visit to Russia.\n\nSince Prime Minister Modi's visit to Russia was perfectly timed with NATO's summit in the United States, it raised many eyebrows, including that of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, who expressed his disappointment when Prime Minister Modi hugged President Putin, saying that it is unfortunate that the Prime Minister of the world's largest democracy is hugging the world's most bloody criminal.\n\nAlthough there are no indications, if Prime Minister Modi and President Putin did discuss a ceasefire, but if they were held, and any progress was made, then Austria could serve as a channel to convey this to the EU and the US.\n\nInteresting Tidbit\n\nAccording to Ambassador T P Sreenivasan, who also served as India's envoy to Austria from 2000 to 2004, India played a crucial role in restoring the sovereignty of the Austrian state.\n\nFormer prime minister Jawahar Lal Nehru intervened during the negotiations of the Austrian State Treaty in June 1953 that paved the way for the removal of allied and Soviet occupation from Austria after the Second World War.\n\nTo this day,

During his visit, the Prime Minister held bilateral discussions with Chancellor Karl Nehammer.\n\nBeing parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and as countries committed to holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the leaders focused on sustainability and recognised that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.\n\nNoting the scope for engagement in the context of the Austrian government's Hydrogen Strategy and the National Green Hydrogen Mission launched by India to address the energy transition challenges, both the leaders supported a wide-ranging partnership between the companies and Research and Development institutions of both countries in renewable/green hydrogen, a press release by the PMO said.\n\nThe two leaders also recognised the importance of research, scientific tie-ups, technology partnerships and innovation in driving forward the bilateral partnership and called for such opportunities to be explored.\n\nThey emphasised the need for stronger collaboration to develop and commercialise technologies in identified areas through new business, industry and Research and Development partnership models, a press release by the PMO office said.\n\nIn the field of economic partnership, both countries welcomed the convening of the first-ever high-level bilateral Business Forum with the participation of the CEOs of several companies in Vienna during the visit. PM Modi and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer addressed the Business Forum and encouraged business representatives to work towards new and more dynamic tie-ups across different sectors.\n\nThe leaders also welcomed initiatives to connect the innovation and start-up ecosystems of the two countries through the Start-Up Bridge, which was set up during the visit of the Austrian Minister of Labour and Economy to India in February 2024 and the successful visit of a group of Indian Start-Ups to Austria in June 2024.\n\nThe leaders also identified a variety of environmental technologies for targeted cooperation in areas such as clean transportation, water and wastewater management, waste management, renewable energy and other clean technologies. \"They encouraged public and private institutions to extend financing for ventures and projects in these sectors to support an expanded engagement in these sectors. They also recognised the growing role of digital technologies in industrial processes (Industry 4.0), including in the area of sustainable economy,\" the release said.\n\nNotably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983. PM Modi's visit to Austria comes after his two-day official visit to Russia, where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPM Modi's visit to Austria also comes at a time when the two countries are marking 75 years of diplomatic relations.

Source: X/@narendramodi\n\nNarendra Modi touched down Vienna late on Tuesday where he is going to strengthen the India-Austria bilateral relations.\n\nModi has the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Austria in 41 years.\n\nPM Modi's Austria trip holds a great significance as it coincides with 75 years of establishing bilateral diplomatic relations between the two countries.\n\nDuring his two-day Vienna visit, PM Modi will meet Austria President Alexander Van der Bellen who is fondly called \"VDB\".\n\nUpon his arrival, Modi was received by Austria Chancellor of Austria Karl Nehammer who will also be accompanying the prime minister when he will address business leaders from India and Austria later on Wednesday.\n\nThe visit of PM Modi is also expected to further strengthen trade and investment as well as defence ties between India and Austria.\n\nIn May last year, both the countries had discussed enhancing bilateral ties in trade and investments, defence, consular and migration among other things.\n\nWith PM Modi heading to Vienna, the Indian Navy is getting to utilise Austria-made Unmanned Air System (UAS) for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). This marks an important milestone in bilateral technological collaboration.\n\nCAMCOPTER S-100 UAS has been developed, designed and produced by Schiebel that was founded in 1951 in Vienna.\n\nTalking to Firstpost, Schiebel India's CEO Jajati Mohanty said: \"Austrian aerospace and security companies have been at the forefront of technological progress particularly in manufacturing, drones, space equipment, small satellites, robotics, cyber security to name a few and have built up dedicated knowledge management for ensuring consistent and quality products.\"\n\n\"India's Atmanirbharta or self-reliance needs the same dedicated approach for quality and consistency in manufacturing of a product,\" he further said.\n\n\"The knowledge and experience Austria has gained over the years to convert ideas to rugged products calls for areas like unmanned systems, cyber security, precision manufacturing (production engineering), robotics and space technology to be the go to sector for the start-up bridge. All these areas are very fundamental to the industry base of any country that wants to consolidate as well as forge ahead in niche products,\" Mohanty further said.\n\nThe Indian Navy is using CAMCOPTER S-100 UAS for ISR to monitor the sea lane of communication in IOR and has been doing the same with unmanned systems since the beginning of 21st century using fixed wing UAVs operated from shore as well as the ships by handing over control to ships at sea.\n\nSoon, Indian Coast Guard and Indian Army will also be using Austria-made CAMCOPTER S-100 UAS, Mohanty said, adding, \"We are in the process of participating in tenders pertaining to Coast Guard and the Army which have similar requirements and specifications.\"\n\nAlso Read: Camcopter S-100 will provide much-needed flexibility in sea-based ops to Indian Navy, says Schiebel India CEO Jajati Mohanty", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Nehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karl Nehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Austria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Van_der_Bellen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Van der Bellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiebel_Camcopter_S-100", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Schiebel Camcopter S-100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firstpost", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firstpost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerospace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aerospace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consul (representative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_space_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outline of space technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_lane", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sea lane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Marketplaces", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Marketplaces", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/07/Modi-in-Austria-2024-07-67dfaa38f1bd24ea1e75b903964364d3-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9717811", "eventUri": "eng-9717811", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 115, "textEnd": 121}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, Modi encouraged Austrian businesses to explore opportunities in India for manufacturing and global supply chain.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said India is ready to give all possible support to restore peace to war-torn Ukraine but stressed that all stakeholders must be present for lasting and comprehensive peace.\n\nDuring his visit to Vienna, the first by an Indian PM in 41 years, Modi and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer supported any collective effort to facilitate a peaceful resolution consistent with international law and the UN Charter.\n\nBoth sides believe that achieving comprehensive and lasting peace in Ukraine requires bringing together all stakeholders and a sincere and earnest engagement between the two parties to the conflict. It may be pointed out that India did not sign the final joint communique at a summit on peace for Ukraine held in Switzerland last month and insisted that conditions need to be created for participation of all parties (read Russia) in such summits to achieve lasting peace in Ukraine.\n\nIndia stands ready to give all possible support to restore peace to Ukraine, Modi said in Vienna after his meeting with Nehammer. \"...I have told earlier also, this is not the time for war, we won't be able to find solution to problems in the warfield.

Prime Minister Modi arrived here after holding several rounds of talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n\n\"We had very intensive talks about the Russian aggression against Ukraine. For me as the Federal Chancellor of Austria, it is particularly important to get to know India's assessment and to understand it and to familiarise India with European concerns and worries,\" he said.\n\n\"Moreover, the conflict in the Middle East was a major topic,\" he added.\n\nBefore he visited Austria, Nehammer said Prime Minister Modi met President Putin. \"So it was particularly important for him to hear about the Prime Minister's personal assessment regarding the intentions of Russia in respect of the peace progress,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi was in Russia for two days for the 22nd India-Russia annual summit before visiting Austria.\n\nDuring his talks with Putin on Tuesday, Prime Minister Modi told him that a solution to the Ukraine conflict is not possible on the battlefield and peace efforts do not succeed amid bombs and bullets.\n\n\"Our shared objective is to achieve a comprehensive, just and permanent peace in line with the UN Charter,\" he said.\n\nHe said India's participation as a founding member of a BRICS organisation in the Swiss peace summit in June over Russia-UKraine was was an important signal.\n\n\"And today, we've been talking about an even stronger commitment and the possibilities of reviving the peace process.\" \"Prime Minister Modi and myself discussed the unique position of India in the so-called Global South. India is an important, influential and credit-worthy country. India is the biggest democracy in the world. And therefore, India's role, especially for Austria, is more than important when it comes to the peace process and future peace summits,\" he said.\n\nNehammer said as a reliable partner, Austria will be available as a site for dialogue, making use of its unique position as a neutral country, a member of the European Union but not a member of NATO.\n\n\"As such Austria is willing to act as a bridge builder and to contribute towards the achievement of a peaceful solution,\" he said.

AFP\n\nVienna is all set to lay the red carpet for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Austria. It coincides with 75 years of establishing bilateral diplomatic relations between both countries. It is also the first visit by an Indian PM to Austria in 41 years. Ahead of his visit, PM Modi said that the India-Austria partnership will be built on 'shared values of democracy'.\n\nPM Modi will meet the Austrian President, Alexander Van der Bellen, who is fondly called \"VDB\". He is a descendant of the former Russian Empire's aristocratic Van der Bellen family of patrilineal Dutch ancestry dating back to the 18th century. VDB describes himself as a centrist liberal and supports green and social liberal policies. He has been the President of Austria since January 26, 2017.\n\nDiplomatic Missions\n\nThe Indian Embassy in Vienna is concurrently accredited to Montenegro and the United Nations Office in Vienna. It is also accredited to the Holy See, which is the universal government of the Catholic Church and operates from Vatican City State, a sovereign, independent territory. Austria is represented in India by its embassy and trade commission in New Delhi, an Honorary Consulate General in Mumbai, and Honorary Consulates in Kolkata, Chennai, and Vasco da Gama, Goa.\n\nBrief History\n\nThe Habsburg monarchy, and later the Austrian Empire, did make three attempts to colonise and settle in India's Nicobar Islands between 1778 and 1886. The initial attempts were partially successful, and the last one had to be abandoned as Britain had already colonised them by then.\n\nDiplomatic relations between newly independent India and Austria, which was still recovering from post-World War II trauma, were established in 1949. India supported Austria during negotiations with the Soviet Union on the Austrian State Treaty in June 1953. India also supported Austria at the UN-South Tyrol conventions. South Tyrol was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until it was annexed by Italy at the end of the First World War. The Fascists subjected the province to a campaign of forced Italianisation through the repression of the German language, mass migration of Italian-speakers to the province, and resettlement of the German-speaking population to the Third Reich. Official assimilation ended after the Second World War, but the dominance of Italian-speakers continued. Austria brought the issue to the United Nations General Assembly in the early 1960s. Finally, the so-called Autonomy Statute entered into force in 1972.\n\nGovernmental Institutions and High-Level Visits\n\nThe Indo-Austrian Joint Economic Commission (JEC) was established in 1983 and involves meetings between governmental ministries and Chambers of Commerce and Industry.\n\nPrime Ministers Nehru and Indira Gandhi visited Austria in 1955 and 1971, respectively. Chancellor Bruno Kreisky visited India in 1980. Indira Gandhi visited Austria for the second time in 1983. Chancellor Fred Sinowatz visited India in 1984. Indian President K R Narayanan visited Austria in 1999 and Austrian President Heinz Fischer visited India in 2005. President Pratibha Patil visited Austria in October 2011. During Patil's visit, Austria expressed support for India's bid for a permanent seat on a reformed United Nations Security Council. President Fischer stated, \"We recognise that the world is changing fast and that the current composition in the Security Council does not reflect the realities of the new world order currently emerging. India deserves to play a bigger role in the Security Council.\"\n\nAustrian Chancellor Christian Kern met PM Modi for a bilateral meeting in St Petersburg in June 2017 on the sidelines of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF). PM Modi also met then Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg in October 2021, on the sidelines of COP-26 in Glasgow. There have been many ministerial exchange visits between the two countries. Also, the parliamentary delegation has had many exchange visits.\n\nEconomic Relations and Bilateral Trade\n\nTotal bilateral trade for 2023 (January to December) was $2.93 billion. Indian exports to Austria were $1.52 billion, and imports were $1.41 billion. Key Indian exports included electronic goods, apparel, textiles, footwear, rubber articles, vehicle and railway parts, electrical machinery, and mechanical appliances. India's imports were machinery, mechanical appliances, railway parts, iron, and steel.\n\nIndia received a cumulative direct investment of 733 million euros in 2023. Cumulative FDI from India to Austria has reached about 1.159 billion euros in 2023. To foster innovation and entrepreneurship between the countries, the India-Austria Start-up Bridge was launched in February 2024.\n\nThere are over 200 collaborations, including 100 technical collaborations and 60 joint ventures between Indian and Austrian firms, particularly in the fields of steel, manufacturing technology, railways, transport, and metallurgy.\n\nBilateral Agreements and MoUs\n\nSeveral bilateral agreements (MoUs) have been signed between the two countries at the government and institution levels, providing the framework for wide-ranging cooperation. These include the avoidance of double taxation, cooperation in infrastructure development, railways, the health sector, science and technology, agriculture, shipping and ports, and Ayurveda, among many others.\n\nAustrian Industrial Strengths\n\nAustria has strength in technology in some core sectors, such as biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, and medical equipment. Austria plays a crucial role in driving innovative mobility concepts, both as a manufacturer and supplier of vehicle technologies and through innovations in the rail and aviation industries. They have a world-class ecosystem for microelectronics. Austria's green tech sector is home to market-leading green tech pioneers, from waste management and recycling to industrial production and the circular economy.\n\nThe Indian Navy is currently testing the rotary unmanned aerial system (UAS) as part of a deal with Austrian company Schiebel for their renowned Camcopter S-100 ahead of PM Modi's visit to the country. The UAS will be for ISR in the Indian Ocean Region.\n\nAustria is at the cutting edge of developments in Deep Tech in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), cyber-security, and quantum technology. Advanced manufacturing is another area of cooperation. Many Austrian industrial companies are leading players in the global market or even world market leaders, such as Andritz AG (industrial plants, equipment, and tooling), Voestalpine AG (steel, automotive, and railway systems), Rosenbauer Group (fire-service vehicles), Miba AG (engine and industrial bearings), Lenzing AG (viscose fibres, filament yarn), and Doppelmayr Group (ropeways and people movers, amusement parks).\n\nScientific and Cultural Relations\n\nAustria's first two satellites, TUGSAT-1 and UniBRITE-1, were launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on-board PSLV-C20 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, on February 25, 2013.\n\nIndo-Austrian cultural relations have a long tradition dating back to the 16th century, when Balthasar Springer travelled from Tyrol in 1505 to India along with the third Portuguese fleet. The Austrian tradition of Indology began in a period renowned for its distinguished philologists and archaeologists between 1825 and 1920. Sanskrit began to be taught at the University of Vienna in 1845. A chair for Sanskrit studies was established and later converted into a chair for Indology. In 1955, it transformed again into a separate Institute for South Asian, Tibetan, and Buddhist Studies, whose main focus is Indology.\n\nThe visit of India's philosopher-poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore twice to Vienna in 1921 and 1926 was one of the crucial bridges of cultural and intellectual exchange between India and Austria. Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore's famous lecture in 1921, 'The religion of the forest', portrayed the value of getting closer to nature and learning union and compassion.\n\nThere is a lot of interest in contemporary Indian literature and theatre. Ayurveda, the Indian traditional system of medicine, has been widely acknowledged and practiced in Austria. The holistic approach of yoga to health care and wellbeing has led many Austrians to embrace yoga, as testified by the presence of many yoga schools in Vienna and other Austrian cities.\n\nSeveral Indian artists have performed in Austria. Amjad Ali Khan, Zakir Hussain, Hariprasad Chaurasia, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt, and Anoushka Shankar have performed in Vienna. Conductor Zubin Mehta is associated with the Vienna Philharmonic and has given great performances. More recently, Bollywood films have begun to be screened at major multiplexes in Vienna. Several Bollywood films have been filmed in Austria, given its scenic locales. Growing numbers of Indian tourists visit Austria annually.\n\nIndians in Austria\n\nThere are around 32,500 Indians, mostly from Kerala and Punjab, living in Austria. They primarily work in the healthcare sector or are self-employed. The Migration and Mobility Agreement has made work migration easier, improved exchanges between students in India and Austria, including rapid visa processing, especially for journalists and researchers, and created an Austrian-Indian Working Holiday Programme. There are over 450 Indian students pursuing their higher education in Austria.\n\nSignificance of the Historic Visit\n\nAustrian Chancellor Nehammer highlighted the significance of the visit, stating, \"This visit is a special honour as it marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in over forty years and a significant milestone as we celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations with India.\" Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his gratitude and excited anticipation for the visit of Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer for his welcoming remarks ahead of Modi's upcoming state visit to Austria.\n\nPM Modi wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \"Thank you, Chancellor @karlnehammer. It is indeed an honour to visit Austria to mark this historic occasion. I look forward to our discussions on strengthening the bonds between our nations and exploring new avenues of cooperation. The shared values of democracy, freedom, and rule of law form the bedrock upon which we will build an ever closer partnership.\"\n\nWay Ahead\n\nIndustry in Austria is a major economic pillar, often overshadowed by the stereotype of the picturesque Alpine country. With 29.2 percent of the GDP, industry plays a leading role in Austria's economy, while tourism, although also important, contributes 13.1 percent to the GDP.\n\nIndia is the world's fastest-growing major economy. It is a huge market. The India-Austria trade is evenly balanced. India has more direct investment in Austria than the other way around. Indian companies must use their financial muscle to acquire more technology companies. Indians must also explore jobs in high-tech industries. The Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement would also support this exercise. German is the official language of Austria and an important prerequisite for participating in the working, economic, and social life of the country. This barrier would have to be surmounted.\n\nVienna, the capital city of Austria, has long been an important centre of musical innovation. Vienna is the European capital of classical music. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Schubert, and Johann Strauss, Jr, among others, were associated with the city. India and Austria must work towards a fusion of classical music.\n\nAustria is home to one of the most prestigious manufacturers of fine-cut crystal. India's large diamond cutting industry can collaborate. Austria is also famous for world-class chocolates, including the Mirabell Mozart. There is scope for cooperation.\n\nPM Modi's visit will increase awareness and increase people-to-people contact. There will also be an impetus for trade and technological cooperation.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Here's Why", "body": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi (right) arrived in Vienna on Tuesday, July 9, 2024. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg received him at the airport. | ANI\n\nFor many, even those usually in the know of things, PM Narendra Modi's visit to Austria perhaps came out of nowhere. When it comes to Europe, aspirational imagination of Indians doesn't go beyond UK, France, Germany and other powerhouse countries. So why Modi chose Austria, especially after visiting Russia is a little riddle not everyone can solve.\n\nFree Press Journal tells you why the Indian PM chose the country.\n\nA non-NATO nation\n\nAustria is part of the European Union (EU) but not of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). Modi's Russia visit, and a meet with Putin complete with the former's signature hug has been a major political statement in the world on the backdrop of the Ukraine war. India and Russia have deep and comprehensive ties since the Cold War times so its not uncommon for an Indian prime minister to visit Russia.\n\nBut right when Russia faces global isolation over its war in Ukraine, Indian PM's Russia visit is a significant development.\n\nIf after Russia, Modi chose to visit a European country which is a NATO member, the visit had potential of creating optics that would make the Russians unhappy. NATO, a military alliance, was formed by the US and its allies specifically to counter Russia and the latter is fiercely opposed to its expansion in Europe and in former Soviet countries.\n\nRussia dogged opposition to NATO expansion is one of the reasons it invaded Ukraine. By choosing to visit Austria, PM Modi, and in turn India, may be symbolically trying to pacify Russia.\n\nAlso, PM Modi has arrived in Austria at a time when NATO summit is going on in Washington. A visit to a non-NATO, but European country gives Indian diplomats ample space to do a balancing act during negotiations with countries around the world.\n\nNehru's role in formation of Austria\n\nIndia's tryst with Austria goes back to the Nehru era. During the Second World War, Austria was occupied by allied powers. After defeat of Nazi Germany, talks began to re-establish Austria as a sovereign, independent country. But Soviet Union, which played a huge part in German defeat, was wary about Austrian statehood as it feared re-emergence of Nazi elements after withdrawal of the allied forces. There was a deadlock in the talks on Austrian statehood over this matter.\n\nAt the time, India has already established close ties with Soviet Union. Karl Gruber, the then foreign minister of Austria requested Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to use India's influence with the Soviets to convince them to take the talks ahead. Nehru then mediated between the two parties and the talks ultimately resulted in re-establishment of independent Austria following the Second World War.\n\nNehru's important role has been acknowledged by Gruber in his memoirs in 1976.\n\nTies without any trouble\n\nIndia's ties with Austria are trouble-free with no major matters impeding the bilateral dialogue. There is room for improvement of course, like Austria considers\n\ngreater Indian role in United Nations Security Council to be of importance. But an unequivocal support for India's bid for permanent seat at the UNSC is something that hasn't comprehensively forthcoming.\n\nHowever, the general mood of the two countries has been very good vis-a-vis bilateral ties.\n\nOpposed to Ukraine war, but not a staunch Russia critic\n\nAustria has voiced its concerns about ongoing war in Ukraine. However, it is not a fierce critic of Russia like other European countries: France, UK and others. This offers India a chance to strike a middle ground when optics are concerned.\n\nPeople connect\n\nAustria is home to more than 30,000 Indians. In addition to that, 25,000 Indian tourists visit Austria each year as tourists.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [],

He also alluded to an attack on Monday when Russian missiles struck across Ukraine, damaging the largest children's hospital in Kyiv and killing at least 42 people nationwide, including some children.\n\n\"Be it war, a struggle or a terrorist attack, every person who believes in humanity, when there is loss of life, he is pained,\" Modi said Tuesday. \"When innocent children are killed, when we see innocent children dying, then the heart pains. And that pain is very horrible.\"\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Modi said in general terms that he and Nehammer had \"extensive discussions\" on all the world's conflicts, including Ukraine. He said that \"problems cannot be solved in the battlefield\" and that \"the loss of innocent lives is not acceptable, wherever it may take place.\"\n\n\"India and Austria both lay emphasis on dialogue and diplomacy for the rapid restoration of peace and stability,\" he said. \"Both of us are ready to provide all possible support to achieve this.\"\n\nModi and Nehammer took no questions from journalists.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

PM Modi spoke about India's perspective on the Russia-Ukraine conflict...\"\n\nThe Foreign Secretary also highlighted PM Modi's extensive engagements with world leaders concerning the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\n\"PM met President Zelenskyy in Tokyo and G20 summit in Italy, then meeting with President Putin.

We will provide all support and for the meeting, two sides need to decide...We have been extremely consistent about it. Our readiness to play whatever role possible,\" Kwatra emphasised.\n\nHe also reiterated Modi's stance on the conflict, stating, \"The PM said it clearly and had 3 elements - this is not a time of war, a solution to Russia-Ukraine conflict cannot be found on the field and wherever innocent lives are lost those are unacceptable. In discussion today dialogue and diplomacy is the way forward for solution. Whatever India can contribute to dialogue, India will do it. Prime Minister elaborated in detail on challenges in the country of the Global South and its impact on the economic aspect. Energy security was impacted and is still a matter of stress.\"\n\nRegarding India's messaging on Russia-Ukraine relations, Kwatra affirmed, \"Messaging on Russia Ukraine by India, PM has been consistent in what he articulated in his meeting in Moscow and he has been consistent about it. When he met the Russian president at the SCO summit in Samarkand, he mentioned that this was not the era of war and said it publicly.\"\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi held significant meetings with Austrian leaders, including Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen and Chancellor Karl Nehammer, to bolster bilateral cooperation and explore new avenues for collaboration between India and Austria.\n\nNotably, this is the first time an Indian Prime Minister has visited Austria in 41 years. Indira Gandhi was the last PM to visit Austria in 1983. PM Modi's visit to Austria comes after his two-day official visit to Russia, where he met Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nPM Modi's visit to Austria also comes at a time when the two countries are marking 75 years of diplomatic relations.

This comes as Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said that India has a crucial role to play in helping end the Ukraine conflict.\n\nAustrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer in a post on X said that his country is ready to be a venue for peace talks, and it is not a member of NATO.\n\n\"Prime Minister @narendramodi and I agree: The West and the countries of the global South must combine forces to further pursue the path chosen at the peace summit in Switzerland. Also in this regard, India has a crucial role. The war in the Ukraine must end; Austria will make every possible effort and is also ready to serve as a venue for dialog.\"\n\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra, in his press briefing, said that right from the start of the Ukraine conflict PM Modi has been \"strongly engaged with both sides and actively engaged in peace efforts\" of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. He said that even at the B\u00fcrgenstock peace meet, India had articulated the need for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve the conflict.\n\nHe said that PM Modi met with the Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines at the G7 in Italy, and met with the Russian President Putin yesterday and the day before. \"All through this engagement, including numerous phone calls, in physical meetings and phone calls, we have been urging -- our message has always been that you need to find a way through dialogue and diplomacy, and offered all support from our side.\n\n\"And it is for the two sides to work it out and talk about it; that is our view. We have been extremely consistent about this in private and public articulation, and have offered our readiness to play whatever role to find peaceful resolution to the conflict,\" the FS said.\n\nKwatra said the ongoing conflict poses challenges to the Global South and the larger stability of the region. \"Whatever is needed to be done through dialogue and diplomacy is what we've believed in. And this is something which has come across a deep sense of belief, not limited to articulation, in PM Modi's articulation of whatever role India can play. But ultimately the two countries have to sit across and talk,\" he added.\n\nKwatra said that \"India as a very responsible and peace-loving member of the global community has said this -- that very few countries have said, that solutions cannot be found on the battlefield, and said this to the Russian president.\"\n\nAsked what PM Modi had shared with the Austrian Chancellor of his meeting with the Russian President in Moscow, the FS said that they are not privy to private conversations. \"Our perspective, how we look at it, the overall sense of it, the challenges it throws up, has been said very publicly.\"\n\nIn his address after holding delegation level talks with PM Modi, the Austrian Chancellor referred several times to the Ukraine conflict and PM Modi's meeting with the Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.\n\nNehammer said that it was important to get PM Modi's \"assessment about the intentions of Russia concerning the peace process\" and that it is Austria's and India's \"shared goal\" to enable \"a comprehensive, just and durable peace in accordance with the UN Charter\" in Ukraine.\n\nHe also said that his cabinet is in constant contact with the EU about PM Modi's visit and he talked with President of the European Council Charles Michel yesterday to inform him personally.\n\nHe said that he considered it \"an important and significant sign\" that India, as a founding member of BRICS, had taken part in the Ukraine peace summit in B\u00fcrgenstock, and that he had talked with Prime Minister Modi about \"an even stronger involvement and possibilities to get the peace process going in principle\".\n\nThe Chancellor also underlined India's special role in the Global South and said that India has an important role to play concerning \"the peace process and future peace summits\". He said \"Austria will be available as a reliable partner and a place for dialogue\". Nehammer underlined Austria's special role as a \"bridgebuilder\", that is part of the EU but not part of any military alliance.\n\nUNI RN", "source": {"uri": "uniindia.com", "dataType": "news",

Austria, together with Ireland, Cyprus and Malta, is a member of EU but not of Nato, which is likely to take a dim view of the warm reception that Modi got in Moscow. Modi may reiterate the call for peace and not war, but Nato countries would want him to condemn Putin for his aggression in Ukraine.\n\nOld friends: Austria, on the other hand, has memories of India-Soviet relations proving beneficial to it during the difficult days of the occupation of Vienna after WWII. Following the 'Khrushchev Thaw' in Europe, Nehru intervened during negotiations in June 1953 on the Austrian State Treaty, which ended the Allied occupation of Austria and restored its sovereignty.

Historic because this will be the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister in 41 years. Modi's visit will revolve around further agreements between India and Austria, particularly the India-Austria startup bridge commenced in February 2024 with an aim to boost startup cultures in both countries.\n\nWe travel back in time and look at the previous three visits by Indian PMs to Austria: two by Indira Gandhi and one by Jawaharlal Nehru.\n\nShortly after her arrival in Vienna on June 19, 1983, a local newspaper caricatured Gandhi warmly greeting Chancellor Fred Sinowatz, humorously suggesting they were unfamiliar faces to each other.\n\nHowever, within three days, both leaders engaged in substantive discussions on global economics, Afghanistan, and bilateral relations. Chancellor Sinowatz praised Gandhi's political foresight and leadership of the non-aligned movement.\n\nThe visit led to the establishment of the Indo-Austrian Economic Commission, set to meet in October to boost bilateral economic ties.\n\nDiscussions also included a major Austrian steel project in India and joint ventures in third countries, along with a supply of 1,500 horses for Indian mountain troops.\n\nDubbed the \"Vienna Waltz\", Gandhi's visit was a prelude to the West Europe-India dialogue congress in Alpbach, attended by over 500 delegates, including 150 from India. Gandhi emphasised global peace and urged redirecting military spending to Third World development.\n\nReactions varied at the congress, with some criticising Gandhi's impact on Indian institutions. Despite differences, the tour successfully increased interest in India among European nations, aligning with Gandhi's goals.\n\nAmid escalating military tensions between India and Pakistan, with increasing troop movements along their shared border, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi continued her tour of Western countries. On October 27, 1971, during her three-day official visit to Austria, she met President Franz Jonas in Vienna.\n\nGandhi reiterated that only a political solution acceptable to the people of East Pakistan could resolve the crisis, describing the situation as \"extremely dangerous\".\n\nThe visit to Austria was part of her broader mission to brief Western leaders on the conflict between India and Pakistan, as well as the internal strife between the Pakistani government and the secessionist movement in Bangladesh (formerly East Pakistan). During her meeting with President Jonas, Gandhi was introduced to top Austrian officials. She later held a 90-minute discussion with Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky.\n\nAfter this meeting, Gandhi highlighted the dire refugee crisis, noting that between thirty thousand and forty-two thousand refugees from East Pakistan were crossing into India daily. She emphasised the perilous nature of the situation and reiterated that a political settlement acceptable to the people of East Pakistan was essential for easing the crisis. Gandhi, who had arrived in Vienna from Brussels, was on the second leg of her six-nation tour in Europe.\n\nJawaharlal Nehru visited Austria in 1955, the same year in which the country gained independence. Nehru's Austria visit was part of his larger East European tour of the USSR, Yugoslavia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Italy.\n\nThe visit by Nehru is remembered for his address to the Vienna reception on June 27, 1955, where he remarked that all countries must come together to prevent any escalation towards a war. He made this statement just a month after Austria had signed the agreement on Austrian Neutrality in the midst of the Cold War period.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

To connect the youth and ideas of both countries, the startup bridge will be accelerated.\"\n\nLater, speaking at a meeting of Indian and Austrian CEOs from diverse sectors, PM Modi called on Austrian business stakeholders to take advantage of the fast-unfolding business opportunities in India. He also spoke about India's success in the field of startups, in the creation of next-generation infrastructure, and its commitment to forge ahead on the green agenda.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that there are around 30-40 Austrian companies in India working in a range of areas from infrastructure development to tunnelling and railway track-laying. What are Austria's strengths in the areas PM Modi mentioned that India can take advantage of?\n\nTransport infrastructure: Austria boasts a well-maintained and extensive road network that includes high-speed highways (autobahns), federal roads, and local roads. The country's road infrastructure is known for its efficiency and safety. The autobahn system is particularly advanced, offering seamless connectivity across regions and neighbouring countries, facilitating efficient movement of goods and people.\n\nAustria has one of the most efficient and modern railway systems in Europe, operated primarily by the Austrian Federal Railways (OBB). The network covers both domestic and international routes, ensuring excellent connectivity. High-speed trains, such as the Railjet, link major cities within Austria and connect to neighbouring countries, enhancing regional integration and mobility. The railway network consists of 6,123 km, of which 3,523 km are electrified.\n\nAustrian cities are also known for their efficient and reliable public transport systems, which include buses, trams, and metro systems. Capital city Vienna's public transport network, operated by Wiener Linien, is well-known for its coverage and punctuality. Wiener Linien operates bus and tram surface routes, and partly underground, partly overground metro or underground train lines (Vienna U-Bahn). The U-Bahn network is being steadily expanded, and to a lesser extent the bus routes, especially in outlying areas of Vienna.\n\nRenewable energy: Austria is a leader in renewable energy, particularly in hydropower, which accounts for a significant portion of its electricity generation. The country also invests in wind, solar, and biomass energy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), Austria is committed to reaching climate neutrality by 2040.\n\n\"Over three-quarters of electricity generation already comes from renewables, with a target of achieving a 100 per cent renewable electricity supply by 2030 (national balance),\" an IEA website posting reads. \"This requires investments to make networks more resilient and flexible, optimise demand side management, and updating the legal and regulatory framework to allow more consumer participation. Buildings and transport account for around half of total emissions. To progress the transition in these sectors, the government supports building renovation, switching from fossil fuels to sustainable heating systems, the electrification of transport and invests in public transport infrastructure.\"\n\nAustria lays particular stress on energy efficiency in infrastructure development, with stringent building codes and standards that promote the use of energy-efficient technologies. Innovative projects, such as energy-efficient housing and smart grids, contribute to reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.\n\nWaste management: Austria has one of the highest recycling rates in the world, supported by an efficient waste management system. The country prioritises waste separation, recycling, and composting. With the Federal Waste Management Plan, the national waste prevention programme is updated regularly, at least every six years. It applies to the whole of Austria and invites all those concerned, whether in the operational or private sphere, to be involved in the local, regional and national implementation.\n\nAround 90 measures cover the focus areas of construction waste, food waste, re-use and prevention in companies, organisations or households, and the new focus areas to be added are plastics and packaging as well as textiles. Extending the lifetime of products, for example through repair, is a key factor in reducing environmental impacts. The promotion of repairs therefore makes a significant contribution to resource conservation and climate protection. Within the framework of the Resilience and Reconstruction Fund, which is financed by the European Union (EU), the Federal Ministry of Climate Action, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology is promoting the repair of electrical and electronic equipment from the second quarter of 2022 until mid-2026.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat

design sensibilities.\n\nAs the curtain fell on the week-long fashion extravaganza, Vicky Kaushal and Rashmika Mandanna captivated the audience with their impeccable looks.\n\nRashmika Mandanna turned heads in a stunning ivory lehenga adorned with intricate sequins and beadwork.\n\nThe lehenga featured a drop-beaded shoulder design on the blouse and was complemented by a gracefully draped long veil.\n\nHer look was completed with open, flowing hair and a smokey eye makeup that highlighted her natural beauty.\n\nThe traditional jewellery, including a delicate mang teeka and hath panja, added a touch of classic elegance to her ensemble.\n\nVicky Kaushal, on the other hand, embraced a regal aura with his pale golden dust sherwani, meticulously embellished with heavy sequined embroidery.\n\nThe outfit was paired with powder-golden ivory pants and matching loafers, creating a harmonious and sophisticated look that exuded luxury and refinement.\n\nFalguni Shane Peacock, celebrating two decades of redefining Indian couture, showcased their latest collection, 'Rang Mahal,' as the highlight of the event.\n\nThis collection was a vibrant homage to India's rich cultural tapestry and architectural grandeur.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the opulence of historic palaces, 'Rang Mahal' featured around forty meticulously crafted ensembles that blended traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.\n\nThe collection paid tribute to India's cultural legacy with intricate designs and luxurious fabrics, all skillfully created by master artisans from the Falguni Shane Peacock atelier and the dedicated weavers at Swadesh.\n\nSwadesh, known for its commitment to preserving India's traditional arts and crafts, collaborates closely with the designer duo to bring these handcrafted wonders to the forefront of global fashion.\n\nThe event was more than just a fashion show; it was a sensory feast that began with a contemporary dance and sitara performance themed in lilac.\n\nThe evening was further enlivened by a live concert featuring contemporary renditions of popular Bollywood hits, adding a dynamic musical element to the runway experience.\n\nThe bridal collection segment was particularly enchanting, with models walking to live renditions of hit songs such as 'Yeh Jo Des Hai Tera' from 'Swades', and other hits like 'Mast Magan', 'Tere Hawale', and 'Peer Vi Tu'.\n\nRashmika and Vicky, as showstoppers, graced the runway to the soulful tunes of 'Tere Bina' from 'Guru' and 'Ve Haaniya', creating an unforgettable finale to the couture week.\n\nIndia

I was genuinely blown away by the work you guys have created. The detailing, royalty, and grandeur was amazing.\n\n\"To be very honest, I really felt like calling Katrina and telling her. So many of the outfits reminded me of my wedding because of the things she wanted particularly. I was like 'This! I spotted that and that!' Katrina is currently on a flight, I'll tell her eventually. Thank you for making me a small part of this beautiful show,\" Vicky said at the post-show press conference here. For their nuptials, Katrina was dressed in a red lehenga and Vicky had donned an ivory sherwani, both designed by celebrity favourite fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.\n\nAt the grand finale, Vicky looked dapper in a beige-coloured buttoned-up Benaras brocade sherwani with straight pants, and Rashmika was grace personified in an ivory lehenga-choli with pearl embellishments, intricate embroidery and glittering sequins with a long train.\n\nRashmika thanked the designers for creating \"masterpieces\" one after the other.\n\n\"I felt like an Indian princess wearing a (garment by) Falguni Shane Peacock. I feel beautiful, gorgeous, confident and super comfortable in it. I think that's what fashion's about,\" she added.\n\nIt was a special night for Falguni Shane Peacock, who marked the 20th year of their fashion label by showcasing \"Rang Mahal\" at the grand finale.\n\nShane, one half of the brand, thanked the guests and media for turning up for the closing despite torrential rains that lashed the capital on Wednesday.\n\nThe designers further said they were \"thrilled\" to mark Falguni Shane Peacock's 20th anniversary with the event.\n\n\"Rang Mahal is more than just a collection; it is a homage to the artisans, the storytellers, and the custodians of our cultural legacy... As each model graces the runway, they carry with them the spirit of India's past and the promise of its future, wrapped in the splendor of our cultural history, preserved and celebrated through fashion,\" they said.\n\nA troupe of Contemporary dancers kickstarted the finale with a live sitar rendition of Elvis Presley's \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" and later blended the modern dance with the 'todas' of Kathak.\n\nThe energy of the show was maintained throughout by the musical ensemble The Bombay Choir, who belted out a range of tracks from the thrilling \"Game of Thrones\" theme, AR Rahman's rousing patriotic numbers \"Maa Tujhe Salaam\" and \"Vande Mataram\", love ballads \"Tere Hawaale\" from \"Laal Singh Chaddha\" and \"Zara Si Dil Mein De Jagah Tu\" from \"Jannat\" to Amir Khusro's popular ghazal \"Chaap Tilak\".\n\nFalguni Shane Peacock's \"Rang Mahal\" is a haute couture collection inspired by the regal and dreamy aspects of India's royal heritage. It drew heavily from several traditional Indian symbols, including the Taj Mahal, tigers, cows, parrots, peacocks, swans, horses, elephants, palaces, diyas, sitar, banyan tree, peepal leaf, roses, and conches.\n\nThis was also the first time the designers have worked with Indian weaves and textiles, highlighting the unparalleled skill and craftsmanship of indigenous weavers.\n\nThere were sarees, evening gowns, and lehenga sarees for women, whereas men were dressed in sherwanis. Luxurious Kanjeevaram silks woven with real gold and silver zari threads, rich velvets, and intricate Chikankari embroideries featured prominently in the apparel.

I think that's what fashion's about,\" she added.\n\nIt was a special night for Falguni Shane Peacock, who marked the 20th year of their fashion label by showcasing \"Rang Mahal\" at the grand finale.\n\nShane, one half of the brand, thanked the guests and media for turning up for the closing despite torrential rains that lashed the capital on Wednesday.\n\nThe designers further said they were \"thrilled\" to mark Falguni Shane Peacock's 20th anniversary with the event.\n\n\"Rang Mahal is more than just a collection; it is a homage to the artisans, the storytellers, and the custodians of our cultural legacy... As each model graces the runway, they carry with them the spirit of India's past and the promise of its future, wrapped in the splendor of our cultural history, preserved and celebrated through fashion,\" they said.\n\nA troupe of Contemporary dancers kickstarted the finale with a live sitar rendition of Elvis Presley's \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" and later blended the modern dance with the 'todas' of Kathak.\n\nThe energy of the show was maintained throughout by the musical ensemble The Bombay Choir, who belted out a range of tracks from the thrilling \"Game of Thrones\" theme, AR Rahman's rousing patriotic numbers \"Maa Tujhe Salaam\" and \"Vande Mataram\", love ballads \"Tere Hawaale\" from \"Laal Singh Chaddha\" and \"Zara Si Dil Mein De Jagah Tu\" from \"Jannat\" to Amir Khusro's popular ghazal \"Chaap Tilak\".\n\nFalguni Shane Peacock's \"Rang Mahal\" is a haute couture collection inspired by the regal and dreamy aspects of India's royal heritage. It drew heavily from several traditional Indian symbols, including the Taj Mahal, tigers, cows, parrots, peacocks, swans, horses, elephants, palaces, diyas, sitar, banyan tree, peepal leaf, roses, and conches.\n\nThis was also the first time the designers have worked with Indian weaves and textiles, highlighting the unparalleled skill and craftsmanship of indigenous weavers.\n\nThere were sarees, evening gowns, and lehenga sarees for women, whereas men were dressed in sherwanis. Luxurious Kanjeevaram silks woven with real gold and silver zari threads, rich velvets, and intricate Chikankari embroideries featured prominently in the apparel. The colour palette ranged from white, ivory, beige, blue, green, red to black.\n\nThe Hyundai FDCI India Couture Week 2024 commenced on July 24.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news",

I was genuinely blown away by the work you guys have created. The detailing, royalty, and grandeur was amazing.\n\n\"To be very honest, I really felt like calling Katrina and telling her. So many of the outfits reminded me of my wedding because of the things she wanted particularly. I was like 'This! I spotted that and that!' Katrina is currently on a flight, I'll tell her eventually.

I met so many people after this show and they loved it. Our beautiful Rashmika and Vicky, we had thought they would be good for the show. Thank you to all the models, they look stunning,\" he added.\n\nAsked about selecting Vicky and Rashmika to walk the ramp, Shane told PTI: \"Rashmika looked so beautiful, demure and pretty. Vicky is like a powerhouse. When he walks in, it just changes the energy. We could not have asked for two better showstoppers.\"\n\n\"Rashmika's outfit is a golden ivory pearl. Vicky is wearing a brocade sherwani which has a lot of detail in it. It is especially created in Benaras, it's hand woven.

This collection was a vibrant homage to India's rich cultural tapestry and architectural grandeur.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the opulence of historic palaces, 'Rang Mahal' featured around forty meticulously crafted ensembles that blended traditional craftsmanship with modern aesthetics.\n\nThe collection paid tribute to India's cultural legacy with intricate designs and luxurious fabrics, all skillfully created by master artisans from the Falguni Shane Peacock atelier and the dedicated weavers at Swadesh.\n\nComing to 'Chhava', the film is a period drama and will see Vicky essaying the role of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj, the eldest son of the Maratha empire's founder and the great warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.\n\nWhile the film will be primarily focused on Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj's sacrifice, and his strategies for warfare, it will also explore a love angle between Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj and his wife, Yesubai Bhonsale (essayed by Rashmika).", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicky_Kaushal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vicky Kaushal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashmika_Mandanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rashmika Mandanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehenga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lehenga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherwani", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherwani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beadwork", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beadwork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Veil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewellery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jewellery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embroidery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embroidery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesubai_Bhonsale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yesubai Bhonsale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambhaji", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sambhaji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maratha_Empire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maratha Empire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivaji", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivaji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapestry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tapestry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weaving", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weaving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_couture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haute couture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artisan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artisan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Memorabilia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Memorabilia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/aug/rashmikavickyimg_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9780614", "eventUri": "eng-9780614", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6235294117647059, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Designer duo and real-life couple Falguni Peacock and Shane Peacock presented their latest collection \"Rang Mahal\" on the last day of the fashion gala on Wednesday.\n\nThe actor, currently basking in the success of \"Bad Newz\", turned showstopper for the couturiers along with Rashmika Mandanna, his co-star in the upcoming period drama \"Chhava\". Vicky, who tied the knot with Katrina in December 2021, said the \"outstanding\" detailing in the garments of the clothing line made him want to ring up his wife before he stepped onto the stage.\n\n\"I was watching the show backstage live on the Instagram page of Falguni Shane Peacock because I wanted to see what the energy was. I was genuinely blown away by the work you guys have created. The detailing, royalty, and grandeur was amazing.\n\n\"To be very honest, I really felt like calling Katrina and telling her. So many of the outfits reminded me of my wedding because of the things she wanted particularly. I was like 'This! I spotted that and that!' Katrina is currently on a flight, I'll tell her eventually. Thank you for making me a small part of this beautiful show,\" Vicky said at the post-show press conference here. For their nuptials, Katrina was dressed in a red lehenga and Vicky had donned an ivory sherwani, both designed by celebrity favourite fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.\n\nAt the grand finale, Vicky looked dapper in a beige-coloured buttoned-up Benaras brocade sherwani with straight pants, and Rashmika was grace personified in an ivory lehenga-choli with pearl embellishments, intricate embroidery and glittering sequins with a long train.\n\nRashmika thanked the designers for creating \"masterpieces\" one after the other.\n\n\"I felt like an Indian princess wearing a (garment by) Falguni Shane Peacock. I feel beautiful, gorgeous, confident and super comfortable in it. I think that's what fashion's about,\" she added.\n\nIt was a special night for Falguni Shane Peacock, who marked the 20th year of their fashion label by showcasing \"Rang Mahal\" at the grand finale.\n\nShane, one half of the brand, thanked the guests and media for turning up for the closing despite torrential rains that lashed the capital on Wednesday.\n\nThe designers further said they were \"thrilled\" to mark Falguni Shane Peacock's 20th anniversary with the event.\n\n\"Rang Mahal is more than just a collection; it is a homage to the artisans, the storytellers, and the custodians of our cultural legacy... As each model graces the runway, they carry with them the spirit of India's past and the promise of its future, wrapped in the splendor of our cultural history, preserved and celebrated through fashion,\" they said.\n\nA troupe of Contemporary dancers kickstarted the finale with a live sitar rendition of Elvis Presley's \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" and later blended the modern dance with the 'todas' of Kathak.\n\nThe energy of the show was maintained throughout by the musical ensemble The Bombay Choir, who belted out a range of tracks from the thrilling \"Game of Thrones\" theme, AR Rahman's rousing patriotic numbers \"Maa Tujhe Salaam\" and \"Vande Mataram\", love ballads \"Tere Hawaale\" from \"Laal Singh Chaddha\" and \"Zara Si Dil Mein De Jagah Tu\" from \"Jannat\" to Amir Khusro's popular ghazal \"Chaap Tilak\".\n\nFalguni Shane Peacock's \"Rang Mahal\" is a haute couture collection inspired by the regal and dreamy aspects of India's royal heritage. It drew heavily from several traditional Indian symbols, including the Taj Mahal, tigers, cows, parrots, peacocks, swans, horses, elephants, palaces, diyas, sitar, banyan tree, peepal leaf, roses, and conches.\n\nThis was also the first time the designers have worked with Indian weaves and textiles, highlighting the unparalleled skill and craftsmanship of indigenous weavers.\n\nThere were sarees, evening gowns, and lehenga sarees for women, whereas men were dressed in sherwanis. Luxurious Kanjeevaram silks woven with real gold and silver zari threads, rich velvets, and intricate Chikankari embroideries featured prominently in the apparel. The colour palette ranged from white, ivory, beige, blue, green, red to black.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I was genuinely blown away by the work you guys have created. The detailing, royalty, and grandeur was amazing.\n\n\"To be very honest, I really felt like calling Katrina and telling her. So many of the outfits reminded me of my wedding because of the things she wanted particularly. I was like 'This! I spotted that and that!' Katrina is currently on a flight, I'll tell her eventually. Thank you for making me a small part of this beautiful show,\" Vicky said at the post-show press conference here. For their nuptials, Katrina was dressed in a red lehenga and Vicky had donned an ivory sherwani, both designed by celebrity favourite fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee.\n\nAt the grand finale, Vicky looked dapper in a beige-coloured buttoned-up Benaras brocade sherwani with straight pants, and Rashmika was grace personified in an ivory lehenga-choli with pearl embellishments, intricate embroidery and glittering sequins with a long train.\n\nRashmika thanked the designers for creating \"masterpieces\" one after the other.\n\n\"I felt like an Indian princess wearing a (garment by) Falguni Shane Peacock. I feel beautiful, gorgeous, confident and super comfortable in it. I think that's what fashion's about,\" she added.\n\nIt was a special night for Falguni Shane Peacock, who marked the 20th year of their fashion label by showcasing \"Rang Mahal\" at the grand finale.\n\nShane, one half of the brand, thanked the guests and media for turning up for the closing despite torrential rains that lashed the capital on Wednesday.\n\nThe designers further said they were \"thrilled\" to mark Falguni Shane Peacock's 20th anniversary with the event.\n\n\"Rang Mahal is more than just a collection; it is a homage to the artisans, the storytellers, and the custodians of our cultural legacy... As each model graces the runway, they carry with them the spirit of India's past and the promise of its future, wrapped in the splendor of our cultural history, preserved and celebrated through fashion,\" they said.\n\nA troupe of Contemporary dancers kickstarted the finale with a live sitar rendition of Elvis Presley's \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" and later blended the modern dance with the 'todas' of Kathak.\n\nThe energy of the show was maintained throughout by the musical ensemble The Bombay Choir, who belted out a range of tracks from the thrilling \"Game of Thrones\" theme, AR Rahman's rousing patriotic numbers \"Maa Tujhe Salaam\" and \"Vande Mataram\", love ballads \"Tere Hawaale\" from \"Laal Singh Chaddha\" and \"Zara Si Dil Mein De Jagah Tu\" from \"Jannat\" to Amir Khusro's popular ghazal \"Chaap Tilak\".\n\nFalguni Shane Peacock's \"Rang Mahal\" is a haute couture collection inspired by the regal and dreamy aspects of India's royal heritage. It drew heavily from several traditional Indian symbols, including the Taj Mahal, tigers, cows, parrots, peacocks, swans, horses, elephants, palaces, diyas, sitar, banyan tree, peepal leaf, roses, and conches.\n\nThis was also the first time the designers have worked with Indian weaves and textiles, highlighting the unparalleled skill and craftsmanship of indigenous weavers.\n\nThere were sarees, evening gowns, and lehenga sarees for women, whereas men were dressed in sherwanis. Luxurious Kanjeevaram silks woven with real gold and silver zari threads, rich velvets, and intricate Chikankari embroideries featured prominently in the apparel. The colour palette ranged from white, ivory, beige, blue, green, red to black.\n\nThe Hyundai FDCI India Couture Week 2024 commenced on July 24.

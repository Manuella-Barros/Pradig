The report also showed a worrisome surge in inflation, with the personal (PCE) consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rising at a 3.7% annual rate after a 2.0% pace in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nYellen downplayed the inflation jump and said she did not see that as indicating that unemployment needed to increase or other areas of the economy needed to cool to return inflation to the Fed's 2% target.\n\n\"The fundamentals here are in line with inflation continuing back down to normal levels,\" Yellen said.\n\nFighting inflation remained President Joe Biden's top priority, Yellen said, highlighting his administration's efforts to reduce healthcare, energy and housing costs. But Biden, a Democrat, has struggled to translate U.S. economic strength into voter support ahead of the November presidential election.\n\nRepublican challenger Donald Trump led Biden by seven percentage points in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll when voters were asked which candidate would be better for the economy.\n\n\"What I focus on most is the strength of consumer spending and investment spending,\" Yellen said. \"Those two elements of final demand came in in line with last year's growth rate ... so this is the underlying strength of the U.S. economy that showed continuing robust strength.\"\n\n\"The headline figure was off a little bit but for reasons that are peculiar and not really indicative of underlying strength,\" she added.\n\nIndeed, a number of private economists said the GDP data likely overstated any weakness in an economy that had grown at above the rate most see as its potential for nearly two years, despite aggressive interest rate hikes over that span by the U.S. Federal Reserve aimed at quashing inflation.\n\nCHINA OVERCAPACITY\n\nYellen told Reuters no option was \"off the table' for dealing with one threat to the U.S. economy - overproduction in China, which was hurting manufacturers in numerous countries.\n\nShe said that while Chinese policymakers have acknowledged they have a problem with\n\nexcess industrial capacity\n\nfor electric vehicles, solar panels and other clean energy goods, they need to address it, with the issue \"discussed intensively\" again last week.\n\nAsked about potential for new tariffs or other actions to protect U.S. producers from an expected flood of Chinese exports, Yellen said she would not eliminate any options as a possible response.\n\nShe said Chinese overproduction threatens the viability of manufacturers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Mexico and India but the problem won't be resolved \"in a day or a week.\"\n\n\"So it's important that China recognize the concern and begin to act to address it,\" Yellen said. \"But we don't want our industry wiped out in the meantime, so I wouldn't want to take anything off the table.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is completing a review of the \"Section 301\" unfair trade tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, which U.S. officials have said could lead to higher tariffs on some products. Biden last week called for the review to triple the Section 301\n\nduties on Chinese steel\n\nto 25%.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai also told senators that the U.S. needed to take \"early action, decisive action\" to protect the fledgling American EV sector from Chinese imports. U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports are now about 27.5%, and few Chinese EVs are sold in the U.S. at the moment.\n\nRUSSIAN ASSET PLANS\n\nYellen said that a\n\nproposal under discussion\n\nby finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) industrial democracies to harness earnings from frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine can be achieved without an outright confiscation of those assets, allaying the concerns of some countries.\n\nYellen welcomed what she called a \"very constructive step\" taken by the European Union to segregate the proceeds from assets held by Brussels-based Euroclear and transfer them to Ukraine, noting future interest could also be pulled forward to back loans to Ukraine.\n\n\"This is an approach that could be broadly supported by countries that are concerned about the seizure of assets, and some of the interest could be brought forward through, for example, a loan,\" Yellen said.\n\nYellen said the approach was among several options being discussed by G7 countries ahead of a leaders summit in June, adding, \"it certainly belongs on the list.\"\n\nThe U.S. approach, led by deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh, is gaining momentum among the G7 nations, two officials from the group told Reuters earlier on Thursday.\n\nMost of the Russian assets held by Euroclear have now been converted to cash, Yellen told Reuters. G7 officials say the assets could generate around $5 billion a year in interest.

U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports are now about 27.5%, and few Chinese EVs are sold in the U.S. at the moment.\n\n\"We have no problem with China producing and selling globally and exporting, but the United States and Europe and other countries also want to have some involvement in the ability to produce clean energy products that are going to be of great importance,\" Yellen said.\n\n(Reporting by Alessandra Galloni; Writing by David Lawder and Dan Burns; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao)", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerging market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Tai", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katherine Tai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_States_Trade_Representative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Office of the United States Trade Representative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/reuters.com/2823a8e0c7218d099f2095109d08b43d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513107", "eventUri": "eng-9513107", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nBy Alessandra Galloni, David Lawder and Andrea Shalal\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters on Thursday that U.S. economic growth was likely stronger than suggested by weaker-than-expected data on first-quarter output and said the Biden administration was keeping all options open to respond to threats from China's excess industrial capacity.\n\nIn a wide-ranging Reuters Next interview, Yellen also said that a U.S. proposal for using the interest earnings from $300 billion in frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine could win broad support from G7 allies.\n\nYellen said U.S. GDP growth for the first quarter could be revised higher after more data is in hand and inflation will ease to more normal levels after a clutch of \"peculiar\" factors held the economy to its weakest showing in nearly two years.\n\n\"The U.S. economy continues to perform very, very well,\" Yellen said in an interview with Reuters, responding to the Commerce Department's report showing that U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 1.6% annualized rate.\n\nThat was below the 2.4% estimated by economists and less than half the pace in the fourth quarter of 2023 - thanks to substantial drags from trade and private inventories. The report also showed a worrisome surge in inflation, with the personal (PCE) consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rising at a 3.7% annual rate after a 2.0% pace in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nYellen downplayed the inflation jump and said she did not see that as indicating that unemployment needed to increase or other areas of the economy needed to cool to return inflation to the Fed's 2% target.\n\n\"The fundamentals here are in line with inflation continuing back down to normal levels,\" Yellen said.\n\nFighting inflation remained President Joe Biden's top priority, Yellen said, highlighting his administration's efforts to reduce healthcare, energy and housing costs. But Biden, a Democrat, has struggled to translate U.S. economic strength into voter support ahead of the November presidential election.\n\nRepublican challenger Donald Trump led Biden by seven percentage points in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll when voters were asked which candidate would be better for the economy.\n\n\"What I focus on most is the strength of consumer spending and investment spending,\" Yellen said. \"Those two elements of final demand came in in line with last year's growth rate ... so this is the underlying strength of the U.S. economy that showed continuing robust strength.\"\n\n\"The headline figure was off a little bit but for reasons that are peculiar and not really indicative of underlying strength,\" she added.\n\nIndeed, a number of private economists said the GDP data likely overstated any weakness in an economy that had grown at above the rate most see as its potential for nearly two years, despite aggressive interest rate hikes over that span by the U.S. Federal Reserve aimed at quashing inflation.\n\nCHINA OVERCAPACITY\n\nYellen told Reuters no option was \"off the table' for dealing with one threat to the U.S. economy - overproduction in China, which was hurting manufacturers in numerous countries.\n\nShe said that while Chinese policymakers have acknowledged they have a problem with excess industrial capacity for electric vehicles, solar panels and other clean energy goods, they need to address it, with the issue \"discussed intensively\" again last week.\n\nAsked about potential for new tariffs or other actions to protect U.S. producers from an expected flood of Chinese exports, Yellen said she would not eliminate any options as a possible response.\n\nShe said Chinese overproduction threatens the viability of manufacturers in the U.S., Europe, Japan, Mexico and India but the problem won't be resolved \"in a day or a week.\"\n\n\"So it's important that China recognize the concern and begin to act to address it,\" Yellen said. \"But we don't want our industry wiped out in the meantime, so I wouldn't want to take anything off the table.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is completing a review of the \"Section 301\" unfair trade tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, which U.S. officials have said could lead to higher tariffs on some products. Biden last week called for the review to triple the Section 301 duties on Chinese steel to 25%.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai also told senators that the U.S. needed to take \"early action, decisive action\" to protect the fledgling American EV sector from Chinese imports. U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports are now about 27.5%, and few Chinese EVs are sold in the U.S. at the moment.\n\nRUSSIAN ASSET PLANS\n\nYellen said that a proposal under discussion by finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) industrial democracies to harness earnings from frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine can be achieved without an outright confiscation of those assets, allaying the concerns of some countries.\n\nYellen welcomed what she called a \"very constructive step\" taken by the European Union to segregate the proceeds from assets held by Brussels-based Euroclear and transfer them to Ukraine, noting future interest could also be pulled forward to back loans to Ukraine.\n\n\"This is an approach that could be broadly supported by countries that are concerned about the seizure of assets, and some of the interest could be brought forward through, for example, a loan,\" Yellen said.\n\nYellen said the approach was among several options being discussed by G7 countries ahead of a leaders summit in June, adding, \"it certainly belongs on the list.\"\n\nThe U.S. approach, led by deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh, is gaining momentum among the G7 nations, two officials from the group told Reuters earlier on Thursday.\n\nMost of the Russian assets held by Euroclear have now been converted to cash, Yellen told Reuters. G7 officials say the assets could generate around $5 billion a year in interest.\n\n(Reporting by Alessandra Galloni;, David Lawder and Andrea Shalal; Additional reporting by Dan Burns and Lindsay Dunsmuir, Writing by David Lawder, Andrea Shalal and Daniel Burns; Editing by Andrea Ricci)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

China exporting its way to full employment is not acceptable to the rest of the world, Yellen said in a Reuters Next interview in Washington.\n\nYellen said that during her trip to China earlier this month, she was \"successful\" in raising U.S. concerns with Chinese officials about Beijing flooding global markets with electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels and other clean energy goods, threatening U.S. jobs. She added that Chinese officials acknowledge a problem with industrial overcapacity, but they needs to address it. She said the issue, which threatens producers of similar goods in the U.S., Europe, Japan and emerging markets such as India and Mexico, was again \"discussed intensively\" with Chinese officials in Washington on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings last week.\n\nYellen added that the problem will not be resolved \"in a day or a week.\" \"So it's important that China recognize the concern and begin to act to address it,\" Yellen said. \"But we don't want our industry wiped out in the meantime, so I wouldn't want to take anything off the table.\"\n\nThe Biden administration is completing a review of the \"Section 301\" unfair trade tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018, which U.S. officials have said could lead to higher tariffs on some products. President Joe Biden last week called for the review to triple the Section 301 duties on Chinese steel\n\nto 25%. U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai also told U.S. senators that the U.S. needed to take \"early action, decisive action\" to protect the fledgling American EV sector from Chinese imports. U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports are now about 27.5%, and few Chinese EVs are sold in the U.S. at the moment.\n\n\"We have no problem with China producing and selling globally and exporting, but the United States and Europe and other countries also want to have some involvement in the ability to produce clean energy products that are going to be of great importance,\" Yellen said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Yellen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janet Yellen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerging market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Tai", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katherine Tai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_United_States_Trade_Representative", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Office of the United States Trade Representative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/27_06_2019_18_01_02_8802375.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9513107", "eventUri": "eng-9513107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

I think they understand our position, and it is a tool that\u2019s available,\u201d she said.\n\nIn December, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order giving the US Treasury authority to sanction foreign banks that facilitate the flow of military goods to Russia.\n\nMore recently, Washington was weighing sanctions against Chinese banks to help US Secretary of State Antony Blinken \u2013 now visiting China from Wednesday to Friday \u2013 persuade Beijing to halt commercial support for Russia\u2019s military production, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Monday.\n\nBlinken\u2019s visit, his second to the country in 12 months, comes as the US and China scale up official contacts to keep their relations from fraying amid their ongoing disputes over issues like trade and Taiwan.\n\nYellen earlier this month travelled for a week to China, meeting with senior Chinese officials and members of the American business community. She voiced US concerns about China\u2019s industrial overcapacity, especially in the new-energy supply chain.US risks \u2018gargantuan\u2019 financial turmoil with threats against Chinese banks\n\n\u201cMy responsibility is to emphasise the undesirable spillovers of excessive subsidies to everything in the clean-energy supply chain. And to make sure that that\u2019s heard at the highest level,\u201d she said in Thursday\u2019s interview.\n\nChinese overcapacity was not just a US issue, Yellen added, describing it as affecting Europe, Japan and emerging markets like India and Mexico.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to dominate the global market. We have no problem with China producing and selling globally and exporting,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cBut the United States and Europe and other countries also want to have some involvement in the ability to produce clean-energy products that are going to be of great importance.\u201d\n\nIn the past decade, China has grown into the biggest player in the global new-energy industrial chain, helped by policy support, heavy government subsidies and the world\u2019s most complete manufacturing infrastructure network.\n\nIt now dominates 80 per cent of the global supply chains of photovoltaic products and automotive batteries, while more than 60 per cent of electric cars in operation globally were made in China.\n\nAs a result, the country\u2019s perceived monopoly of the sector has evoked some backlash.\n\nThe US has largely kept Chinese EVs at bay, thanks to an additional 25 per cent tariff imposed since the administration of former president Donald Trump. In 2022, the Biden administration enacted the Inflation Reduction Act that entails comprehensive subsidies for US domestic new-energy manufacturers.\n\nYellen said she has been engaging in \u201cintense discussion\u201d with Chinese senior officials on the issue of industrial overcapacity, including during the fourth meetings of the US-China economic and financial working groups that took place on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in mid-April.How far did Janet Yellen\u2019s trip move the ball for US-China relations?\n\n\u201cThis is a problem that developed over many years. It\u2019s not going to be solved in a day or a week,\u201d Yellen said.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s important that China recognises the concerns and begins to act to address them. But we don\u2019t want our industry wiped out in the meantime, so I wouldn\u2019t want to take anything off the table.\u201d\n\nThe treasury secretary noted her thoughts on comparative advantage \u2013 a foundational principle in international trade referring to an economy\u2019s ability to produce a particular good or service at a lower opportunity cost than its trading partners \u2013 has changed with respect to China, while denying it presaged further protectionism.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s well documented that the United States experienced what\u2019s referred to as a \u2018China shock\u2019, which was after China was admitted to the WTO, its exports to the United States utterly surged \u2026 And that really ended up with the huge loss of good manufacturing jobs in parts of the country that have really never seen employment recover,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in favour of free trade. But it has to be something that broadly benefits people throughout the country.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [],

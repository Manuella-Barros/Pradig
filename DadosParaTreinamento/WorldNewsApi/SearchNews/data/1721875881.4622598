St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral hosted the first Motorcycle Blessing ever in its 145-year history on Saturday. \u201cWe basically shut down six highways, three bridges and Midtown Manhattan and we arrived on a long train of motorcycles,\u201d retired NYPD Sgt. Steve Cataneo, who teamed up with Joseph Imperatrice, co-founder of Blue Lives Matter NYC, to organize the event. The morning began with a charity motorbike run for the families of fallen officers, which started at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, NJ and ended at St. Pats, and was fully police escorted from beginning to end. Participants gathered inside St. Pats for a prayer service for active and retired police officers and first responders and then headed outside for the blessings of their bikes. Father Andrew King blessed the crowd lined up on West 51st Street and their motorcycles parked beside them with holy water, and some bikers did the sign of the cross in reverence. The money raised from the riders\u2019 registration fee along with any donations they received, went towards Blue Lives Matter, a nonprofit organization created to help law enforcement officers and their families, and a portion was also donated to St. Patrick\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m a retired police sergeant, so I know what cops go through and their families,\u201d said Cataneo, a member of a New Jersey chapter of the Punishers Law Enforcement Motorcycle Club. \u201cSo it means a lot.\u201d", "summary": "The second annual Motorcycle Blessing took place on Saturday afternoon, and was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral for the first time this year.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/22/us-news/st-patricks-cathedral-holds-first-motorcycle-blessing-in-its-145-year-history-means-a-lot/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/84301314.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VNE601lo-RyIcpnTz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:52:21", "author": "Angela Barbuti", "authors": ["Angela Barbuti"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.016}

The Liberty Justice Center, based in Chicago, and Raleigh-area lawyers Troy Shelton and Craig Schauer are counsel for the plaintiffs for the case filed Tuesday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina.\n\nThe lawsuit asks for full clearance and removal of the mark on McGhee's record. Damages in an amount to be determined at trial are also being sought.\n\nDean McGee, educational freedom attorney at the Liberty Justice Center, in an exclusive interview Tuesday morning with The Center Square, said, \"It impacts, every student in the country, and their right to speak without fear of aggressive retaliation from their administration. In this case, our client, in the context of the conversation, asked a question that on its face was racially neutral. It was earnest in the class discussion.\n\n\"From there, the administration fabricated a racial incident, and had the audacity to tell a Hispanic student who said he was not offended that he should have been offended. We want to make sure this doesn't happen again.\"\n\nThe lawsuit says McGhee's right to free speech, right to education and right to due process have all been violated by the school district. Response from the school district is being sought by The Center Square.\n\nAccording to McGhee's lawyers, the situation unfolded in class on April 9. The sophomore raised his hand and asked if the teacher's reference to \"aliens\" referred to \"space aliens, or illegal aliens who need green cards?\"\n\n\"Christian asked his question,\" McGee said. \"A boy in his class, of Hispanic heritage, jokingly said 'Hey, I'm going to kick your ...'\" and used an expletive.\n\nMcGee said class continued in usual fashion, that the two teens are friends and there was \"no legitimate threat of a fight.\"\n\nThe teacher, afterward, called in administration regarding not the use of the words, but the appearance of a threat. Assistant Principal Eric Anderson, McGee said, talked to the teens.\n\n\"The kid said he was joking\" about a fight, and that \"he was not offended,\" McGee said. \"He said it was no big deal.\"\n\nIn addition to telling the student he should have been offended, McGee said Anderson gave the student a suspension in school of less than one day and remarked about his Spanish grade being low despite his heritage.\n\n\"These two students, by all indications,\" McGee said, \"had no issues with each other. It's the administrators at the school who escalated this into national news and a racial incident.\"\n\nMcGhee's suspension was for three days, no appeal was permitted, and he was kept out of a track meet.\n\nHis parents said he was branded a racist, ostracized, bullied and received threats upon his return to school. He's finishing the academic year in homeschooling, having joined a growing trend in the state looking for alternatives to the traditional public school system.\n\nHis mother, Leah, said in a release from the Liberty Justice Center, \"I have raised our son to reject racism in all its forms, but it is the school, not Christian, that injected race into this incident. It appears that this administration would rather destroy its own reputation and the reputation of my son rather than admit they made a mistake.\"\n\nBuck Dougherty, senior counsel at Liberty, said in the release, \"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question - about a word the class was discussing - the school board branded him with false accusations of racism. The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech, but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law. We are proud to stand beside Christian and his family in challenging this egregious violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n\nMcGee said Liberty is ready to discuss damages with the school district. A preliminary injunction is being sought that would clear McGhee's record pending outcome of the litigation so that his quest for scholarships, college admissions and other actions typical of finishing high school and preparing for college will not be impacted.\n\nThe firm, which litigates cases on free speech, workers' rights, education and government overreach, said it is ready to proceed with discovery and move toward a trial.\n\nMore from this section\n\nNew Insurance Lead Generation Company Increases Online Visibility for Niche Insurance Agencies and Carriers MMI Webinar

The lawsuit is in response to the school suspending him for using the term \"illegal alien\" in class.\n\nChristian McGhee, represented by the Liberty Justice Center, alleges that his suspension from Central Davidson High School violates his constitutional rights to free speech and due process.\n\nThe incident that brought about the lawsuit occurred on April 9, 2024, during an English class vocabulary lesson according to a press release from the Liberty Justice Center.\n\nOn April 9, sophomore Christian McGhee raised his hand and asked his English teacher whether her reference to the word \"aliens\" referred to \"space aliens, or illegal aliens who need green cards?\" Although there was no substantial disruption to the class, the school decided to suspend Christian for three days out of school, with the administration equating his question to a vicious racial slur. Christian was also prohibited from competing in a season-defining track meet. No appeal was permitted.\n\nHaving been branded as a racist by his school, Christian's return was met with ostracism, bullying, and threats. Concerned for his safety, his parents unenrolled him and he is now completing the semester through a homeschooling program.\n\nAfter McGhee asked the question, one of his classmates jokingly said he would \"kick [McGhee's a**.\" The teacher reported the exchange to the assistant principal, who brought in both boys for questioning. The classmate confirmed that he was not offended and was joking with McGhee. However, Assistant Principal Anderson deemed the joke offensive and suspended the student.\n\nLeah McGhee, Christian's mother, was incensed by the school's decision, explaining that she raised her son \"to reject racism in all its forms\" and that it was the school \"that injected race into this incident.\"\n\n\"It appears that this administration would rather destroy its own reputation and the reputation of my son rather than admit they made a mistake,\" she added.\n\nThe Liberty Justice Center contended that the school's actions are a form of viewpoint discrimination. Buck Dougherty, Senior Counsel at the organization, argued that \"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism.\"\n\nIn its press release, the organization refers to the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District to bolster its case against the school. In this ruling, the Court held that students do not \"shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,\" which could pose a problem for McGhee's school.\n\nThis was clearly a case of a school punishing a student for their perception of his political views. The fact that the mere utterance of the term \"illegal alien\" was enough for the school to suspend him suggests a clear political motive. Even if his classmates were offended by his choice of words, suspending him was clearly an over-the-top reaction to what appears to be an innocent comment.\n\nNot only was the suspension a ridiculous response, but blowing it up to such an issue has clearly caused even more harm to McGhee. The assistant principal essentially labeled him a racist for no valid reason. Coming from a member of the school's leadership, his reaction could have contributed to the bullying and ostracization McGhee went through. If schools are allowed to get away with this conduct, the problem will only get worse. Hopefully, the court can clearly see what happened here and give the appropriate ruling.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_charles@redstate.com", "name": "Jeff Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Davidson_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Davidson High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Due process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_right", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional right"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ostracism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homeschooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewpoint_discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viewpoint discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tinker v.

(RELATED: School Suspends Teen For Using Term 'Illegal Alien' During Class: REPORT)\n\n\"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism,\" Senior Counsel at the Liberty Justice Center Buck Dougherty alleged in the release.\n\n\"The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech, but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law. We are proud to stand beside Christian and his family in challenging this egregious violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments,\" he further alleged.\n\nIn early April, McGhee was suspended for three days from Central Davidson High School in Lexington, North Carolina, the press release reads. The 16-year-old had been in an English class working on a vocabulary assignment when he raised his hand to ask the teacher whether her reference to the word \"aliens\" was alluding to \"space aliens, or illegal aliens who need green cards?\"\n\nThe question allegedly offended another student in the classroom who allegedly said he wanted to fight McGhee, triggering the teacher to call the assistant principal, according to The Carolina Journal. The word was then allegedly deemed as offensive and disrespectful to Hispanic classmates by school administrators, the outlet reported.\n\nMcGhee's mother, Leah, later alleged during an exclusive interview with Louder with Crowder that she believed the assistant principal was the one who \"insinuated racism.\" She claimed the boy who allegedly took offense later stated he was \"joking.\"\n\n\"I didn't make a statement directed towards anyone; I asked a question,\" McGhee told The Carolina Journal in response to the punishment. \"I wasn't speaking of Hispanics because everyone from other countries needs green cards, and the term 'illegal alien' is an actual term that I hear on the news and can find in the dictionary.\"\n\nSince the allegations from the school, McGhee has allegedly faced \"ostracism, bullying, and threats\" after returning from his suspension, according to the press release. Consequently, McGhee's parents feared for his safety and removed him from Central Davidson High School, placing him into a homeschooling program for the remainder of the semester instead.\n\n\"I have raised our son to reject racism in all its forms, but it is the school, not Christian, that injected race into this incident.

He missed several very important track meets, and, since that time, we have removed him from the school,\" McGhee told co-host Ainsley Earhardt on Wednesday.\n\n\"We have asked the school to handle this privately for weeks. I have emailed the school board for four weeks. I've had no response from the school board, and since... we had no resolution, we had no other choice but to file a lawsuit and take this public.\"\n\nChristian was suspended last month after he asked his teacher if a conversation in class was centered around \"spaceship aliens\" or \"illegal aliens who need green cards\" after he returned to the classroom from the restroom.\n\nMcGhee said after Christian asked his teacher the question, a student of Latino descent jokingly said he was going to \"kick his you-know-what.\" Although class proceeded normally, both students were eventually pulled out of the classroom to address the exchange, she claimed.\n\nThe Latino student reportedly told the administrator he was not offended by Christian's comment, and both teens agreed there were no hard feelings, but Christian was suspended for three days and was unable to appeal his punishment anyway.\n\nMcGhee said when she initially got the call from the school she was furious, given that she had raised her son in a Christian-based household. Shortly after arriving at the school, however, she said she quickly realized the assistant principal was guilty of \"injecting\" racism into the incident.\n\nLiberty Justice Center attorney Dean McGee argued the United States government uses the term \"illegal alien,\" which is clearly defined in Webster's Dictionary, and has no racial specification.\n\nNEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICANS BELIEVE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION IS REAL CRISIS, NOT A MEDIA NARRATIVE: POLL\n\nHe argued the school district went against Christian's right to due process since he was unable to appeal their decision and violated his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.\n\n\"There's no case for racism on its face. It's a completely neutral term,\" McGee said. \"I've gotten to know this family pretty well, over the last week and a half. And there is not an iota of racism to this boy, to his parents, and it's an outrageous suspension with serious consequences unless the court fixes this.\"\n\n\"The government has branded Christian a racist, deprived him of his right to an education for three days, deprived him of his ability to participate in track, and told him there will be no appeals,\" he continued. \"It's as clear a due process case as I can imagine.\"\n\nMcGhee said her son has received countless threats since the incident took place and has been branded \"racist boy\" by some of his peers.\n\nChristian was pulled out of the school over safety concerns despite the fact he had just moved to the area with his family in August.\n\n\"Before people understood what actually took place, Christian was getting threats. Christian was being called a racist,\" McGhee said.\n\n\"It's hard enough moving to a new area as a 16-year-old boy, but he loved that school. We loved that school. Now that the truth is being exposed, and we were able to speak at the board meeting, I cannot tell you how overwhelmed we are by the support that we're receiving from this amazing community that we live in, and also the community of Brunswick County, Oak Island in Southport, North Carolina, where we moved from.\"\n\n\"We have been overwhelmed. We've been receiving messages from all over the country of people standing with Christian and... saying, 'Reverse this suspension, remove this label of racism,' that was so unfairly placed on our child,\" she continued.\n\nThe Davidson County Schools district and Davidson County Board of Education did not return requests for comment from Fox News and Fox News Digital.", "source": {"uri":

The hispanic student said, according to the suit, that he was not \"upset\" or \"offended.\"\n\nThe school ultimately suspended McGhee, \"even though there was no substantial disruption to the class,\" his lawyers argue, while noting that school administrators equated McGhee's question \"to a vicious racial slur.\"\n\nThe lawyers further claim that McGhee, having been \"branded a racist by his school,\" returned to classes and faced \"ostracism, bullying and threats,\" due to his question in English class. His parents ultimately decided to complete the school year by homeschooling the boy.\n\nDean McGee, Educational Freedom Attorney at the Liberty Justice Center, views this as a First Amendment and due process fight.\n\n\"The school branded this a racial incident independently. There's nothing indicating it was. It was a completely neutral legal phrase. Everyone from the Supreme Court justices, to academics, to the actual U.S. code and judges in the very district where we're filing use the term 'aliens, 'illegal aliens, green cards.' These are common terms,\" McGee told OutKick.\n\n\"The school's stance seems to be this was offensive even if no one in class actually found it to be offensive.\"\n\nFaced with the inability to appeal his suspension, the high school sophomore was forced to miss a critical track event.\n\nLawyers believe their client wasn't provided with the ability to defend himself, which they view as troubling because of what it might mean for other students and their ability to speak in class. They contend vague speech guidelines such as what Christian McGhee faced, are bad news.\n\n\"Our client wasn't trying to make any political point, wasn't trying to be provacative,\" McGee said. \"If the school's decision stands, any kid in any school could be scared just to ask a question in class like our client did.\"\n\nThe lawsuit against the Davidson County School District asks for the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina to clear Christian McGhee's name and for damages to be determined at trial.\n\n\"I have raised our son to reject racism in all its forms, but it is the school, not Christian, that injected race into this incident,\" Leah McGhee, the boy's mother, said in a press release announcing the suit. \"It appears that this administration would rather destroy its own reputation and the reputation of my son rather than admit they made a mistake.\"\n\nMonday night, at the Davidson County School Board meeting, Leah called for two board members to be removed because they are \"corrupt.\"\n\nAs a reminder, Merriam-Webster dictionary has yet to pull \"illegal alien\" from the dictionary.

It appears that this administration would rather destroy its own reputation and the reputation of my son rather than admit they made a mistake,\" said Leah McGhee, Christian's mother.\n\nThe suit names the Davidson County Board of Education and Eric Anderson, Central Davidson High School's assistant principal, as the defendants.\n\nThe Liberty Justice Center is representing McGhee.\n\nAn English teacher's vocabulary assignment included the word \"aliens.\" McGhee asked the teacher if the word \"referred to 'space aliens or illegal aliens who need green cards.'\"\n\nA student said he would \"kick [McGhee's] ass. The teacher contacted Anderson, the assistant principal.\n\nAnderson brought in McGhee and the student who complained. The student, identified as R., told Anderson (my emphasis) \"that he was not offended.\" He was JOKING.\n\nThat wasn't good enough for Anderson:\n\nWhen R. said that he was not offended, Mr. Anderson disagreed and told R. that C.M.'s words \"were a big deal,\" effectively telling R. that he should have been offended.\n\nThen Anderson spoke to C.M. and said that R. was \"upset,\" \"crying,\" and \"offended.\" C.M. did not find these assertions believable because he could see that R. was not upset. But C.M. listened to Assistant Principal Anderson and told his side of the story. Mr. Anderson would later recall telling C.M. that it would have been more \"respectful\" for C.M. to phrase his question by referring to \"those people\" who \"need a green card.\"\n\nIt turns out that R. and McGhee are good friends. He said he didn't cry when he met with Anderson. He also didn't feel upset or offended.\n\nR. then said, \"'If anyone is racist, it is [Mr. Anderson] since he asked me why my Spanish grade is so low'\" -- an apparent reference to R.'s ethnicity.\"\n\nThe staff agreed that \"illegal aliens\" offend Hispanic students.\n\nThe high school gave McGhee a three-day suspension. The school gave R. a \"brief in-school suspension\" for his joke response.\n\nThe Liberty Justice Center claims McGhee faced \"ostracism, bullying, and threats\" after his suspension. His parents pulled him from school so he could finish the term through homeschooling.\n\n\"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism,\" said Buck Dougherty, Senior Counsel at the Liberty Justice Center. \"The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech, but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law. We are proud to stand beside Christian and his family in challenging this egregious violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the high school \"engaged in viewpoint discrimination\" when it relied on its viewpoint that \"illegal aliens\" show racial discrimination.\n\nThe school never punished those who allegedly bullied McGhee:\n\nThe viewpoint discrimination is evident from the School's decision to not harshly punish another student who made a comment threatening violence against C.M. -- a comment that, on its face, is far more disruptive to the learning environment. It is further evidenced from a School administrator's assertion that harsh punishment was necessary to avoid being \"unfair\" to students who received the same punishment \"for saying the N word\" -- a preposterous comparison.\n\nAt Reason, Billy Binion said the judges might use the ruling from Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District. The Supreme Court sided with the students wearing black armbands to school to protest the Vietnam War.\n\nJustice Abe argued, \"It can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\"\n\nAbe also wrote:\n\nThe District Court concluded that the action of the school authorities was reasonable because it was based upon their fear of a disturbance from the wearing of the armbands. But, in our system, undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression. Any departure from absolute regimentation may cause trouble. Any variation from the majority's opinion may inspire fear. Any word spoken, in class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviates from the views of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance. But our Constitution says we must take this risk, Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.

Racism is only a three-day suspension with no appeal when it should be a top-tier punishment.\"\n\nShe went on to say that she had sent emails requesting help from the board, but they allegedly did not provide any relief for the situation. Instead, she alleged that the board shared information about her past in an effort to cause further harm.\n\n\"I have raised our son to reject racism in all its forms, but it is the school, not Christian, that injected race into this incident. It appears that this administration would rather destroy its own reputation and the reputation of my son rather than admit they made a mistake,\" Ms. McGhee said in a statement.\n\nMs. McGhee told the board members and attendees at the meeting that she had been arrested 14 years ago for possession of pain medication, adding that she was sentenced to six years in prison but was released early and successfully reintegrated into society. She added that she had publicly shared her story during more than 30 speaking engagements to help others facing addiction.\n\nDavidson County School Board's chair, Alan Beck, did not immediately respond to The Epoch Times' request for comment.\n\nFollowing his suspension, Christian returned to school, but he was reportedly \"met with ostracism, bullying, and threats.\"\n\n\"Concerned for his safety, his parents unenrolled him, and he is now completing the semester through a homeschooling program,\" the Liberty Justice Center said in a press release.\n\nAttorney Buck Dougherty of the Liberty Justice Center argues that the school violated the teen's right to due process and his right to access education.\n\n\"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism,\" Mr. Dougherty said in a statement. \"The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law.

He said Ms. McGhee had requested a meeting with all parties to address the alleged offense.\n\nInstead, the school chose a harsh form of punishment for an offense that he claimed was nothing more than a student asking his teacher a clarifying question about a vocabulary word.\n\nThe lawyers said that Christain was a good student academically and involved in athletics.

First performed in 1972, Carlin was actually arrested after that performance for uttering words that weren't allowed to be said in public.\n\nToday, a lot of those words can be uttered in a classroom. But it's apparently illegal to say the term \"illegal alien\" in a classroom as Leah McGhee's high school son Christian found out.\n\nThe North Carolina kid was given an assignment by his English teacher to write about the word \"alien.\" Christian McGhee asked the teacher for clarification. Was it a \"space alien\" or an \"illegal alien without green cards\"?\n\nOne of the kids in Christian's class took offense to using the term \"illegal aliens,\" and the school administration agreed. Christian was suspended for three days.\n\nFor sheer idiocy, this tops the list. The kid was asking a question about an assignment. He wasn't disparaging anyone or singling out any ethnic group.\n\nThe Liberty Justice Center took the case.\n\n\"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism,\" Senior Counsel at the Liberty Justice Center Buck Dougherty said in a statement. \"The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law.

We're going to have our kids walking on eggshells at school, terrified they're going to say the wrong word or unintentionally offend someone.\n\nFox News:\n\nAccording to the attorneys, Christian was prohibited from taking part in a track meet and faced bullying and threats at his school. His parents eventually unenrolled him, and he is completing his semester in a homeschooling program.\n\nNotably, the lawsuit says, the student who allegedly took offense to Christian's question clarified that he was not actually upset or offended by the term. The lawsuit also cited, \"a School administrator's assertion that harsh punishment was necessary to avoid being 'unfair' to students who received the same punishment 'for saying the N word' -- a preposterous comparison.\"\n\nAnyone who takes offense at a term the United States government used for 250 years to describe a noncitizen who entered the country without permission needs an intervention. Indeed, the idea that it's suddenly racist to use the term does violence to the English language.\n\nYou can't go changing the definition of a word based on politics. The term \"illegal alien\" perfectly describes a noncitizen entering the country without permission. The only people who want to change it are those who want to obscure the issue that the words reveal.\n\n\"School officials have effectively fabricated a racial incident out of thin air and branded our client as a racist without even giving him an opportunity to appeal. Fortunately, young people do not shed their First Amendment rights at school, and we look forward to vindicating Christian's rights here,\" educational freedom attorney at the Liberty Justice Center Dean McGee said.\n\nThe lawsuit is calling for the school board to reverse and remove the suspension, along with the claim that he used \"racially\" motivated language in class, from his record. The family is also seeking a public apology and monetary damages to be determined at the trial.\n\nIn a comment via the Liberty Justice Center, Leah McGhee said, \"I have raised our son to reject racism in all its forms, but it is the school, not Christian, that injected race into this incident. It appears that this administration would rather destroy its own reputation and the reputation of my son rather than admit they made a mistake.\"\n\nThat's typical of schools that never apologize for anything.

However, when it comes to illegal immigration, many tense up and feel uncomfortable labeling certain individuals by their status, or rather, lack of status, regarding citizenship.\n\nYou might even see protester signs that read, \"No human can be illegal!\" But if an individual who was born and bred in the U.S. were to illegally enter and live in another country while demanding citizenship, this would simply not fly, and they would be considered an illegal alien as well. It has nothing to do with skin color or country of origin. It is about taking the correct legal steps required to enter or live in any country.\n\nThose who are concerned about the integrity of America's borders are also particularly concerned about the growing usage of \"feel good\" words like \"undocumented immigrant.\" Erroneous and fluffy language gives the impression that breaking our immigration laws is not a major concern.\n\nMeanwhile, in North Carolina, a male student was recently suspended for three days for simply using the term \"illegal alien\" in class. The student is now formally suing the school district for \"harsh punishment\" and \"false accusations of racism.\"\n\nThe mother of the student, Leah McGhee, explained to reporters that an English teacher at Central Davidson High School in Lexington assigned a vocabulary exercise in April that included the word \"alien.\" Her son Christian then raised his hand and inquired as to what the teacher meant.\n\n\"Like space aliens or illegal aliens without green cards?\" Christian asked.\n\nSoon after, this question prompted the teacher to speak with the assistant principal after a different student allegedly took offense to the term and vowed to \"fight\" Christian. Christian was then given a three-day suspension by school administrators after they determined that his question was \"disrespectful to Hispanic students.\"\n\nHowever, this was seen as incredibly racist by many social media users online who learned about Christian's punishment.\n\n\"Dem teachers and administrators are so racist and close-minded that they assume illegal aliens only refer to Hispanics, LOL!\" said one X (Twitter) user.\n\nMeanwhile, the Liberty Justice Center declared on Tuesday that it will be representing McGhee in a lawsuit against the Davidson County Board of Education following the story's online virality.\n\n\"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism,\" senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center Buck Dougherty said in a statement. \"The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech, but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law. We are proud to stand beside Christian and his family in challenging this egregious violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n\nThe attorneys also said that Christian later experienced bullying and violent threats in addition to being forbidden from participating in a track meet. After a while, his parents even dropped him from school, and he is currently finishing his semester in a homeschooling program.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that \"a school administrator's assertion that harsh punishment was necessary to avoid being 'unfair' to students who received the same punishment 'for saying the N word' -- a preposterous comparison.\"\n\nTeachers and administrators essentially tried to compare a legally correct term, with a highly offensive racial slur.\n\n\"School officials have effectively fabricated a racial incident out of thin air and branded our client as a racist without even giving him an opportunity to appeal. Fortunately, young people do not shed their First Amendment rights at school, and we look forward to vindicating Christian's rights here,\" educational freedom attorney at the Liberty Justice Center Dean McGee said.\n\nThe complaint demands that the school board expunge the allegation that he spoke in class with \"racially\" offensive words, which could affect his applications when applying to colleges. In addition, the family is requesting a public apology and unspecified monetary damages at trial.\n\n\"The phrase 'illegal aliens' has taken on a pejorative tone in recent years, and in response, some institutions have determined that they will cease to use it,\" the Library of Congress said in an executive summary. \"For example, in April 2014 the Associated Press announced that 'illegal' would not be used as a descriptor for any individual,\" according to visaandgreencard.com\n\nStay informed!

The boy who responded to our client said, 'hold on, I wasn't really offended. This isn't a big deal.' And the words of the assistant principal, these are his own words, explained what he said to our client's mother, 'No, sir. Those words are a big deal,'\" McGee said.\n\n\"In other words, the assistant principal was telling this boy, well, you might not be offended, but you should be offended,\" he added.\n\nMcGee also recalled that Leah McGhee, Christian's mother, had suggested a mediation session between the two families and the faculty to discuss the situation rather than dole out punishment.\n\n\"And the assistant principal said no. Harsh punishment. Three days out of school suspension. That was his solution. Not empathy, not understanding, just punishing this child and branding him racist on his permanent record,\" McGee said. \"But the ironic result is a total lack of empathy toward either student, total lack of healing, lack of a learning opportunity, and just meeting out punishment, stigmatizing, branding a 16-year-old boy in a way that could harm his future if it's not fixed.\"\n\nAlthough the McGhee family has faced backlash and threats on the assumption that Christian said something racist, McGee noted that there has also been overwhelming support for the family.\n\n\"I don't mean to downplay the harassment and threats that my client and his mother received. But there's also been an outpouring of support, and I think that support just comes from a place of intuitive empathy for a kid who is being mistreated by his own school and in such a vicious way that has a potential impact on his future,\" McGee said.\n\nPublic opinion also appeared to take the McGhee family's side at the Davidson County Board of Education meeting Monday night. All but two speakers voiced their support for Christian McGhee and attacked the school board for failing to address his suspension.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA BECOMES 9TH STATE TO PASS UNIVERSAL SCHOOL CHOICE, THE FIRST TO DO SO WITHOUT GOP TRIFECTA\n\n\"You are not in any way, shape or form helping our students. By the way, if you squash a student's question, you squash education. I'm appalled, and you still got the smirk on your face. I so hope you get voted out,\" one speaker said.\n\nThe McGhee family is seeking a public apology from the school board on the matter and demanding that the suspension be removed from Christian's record. In the event the district court does not rule in their favor, they are prepared to appeal.\n\n\"Our organization has appealed in the past and won a case at the Supreme Court. We would be willing to do that here if it's necessary.

Christian's mother, Leah McGhee, recently sat down with BlazeTV's Sara Gonzales on an episode of \"Sara Gonzales Unfiltered\" to discuss the details of the incident and the lawsuit.\n\nLast month, Christian returned to English class after using the bathroom and found the class talking about aliens. Since he had been out of the room when the discussion began, he didn't understand the context of it. So he asked his teacher: \"Like space aliens or illegal aliens who need green cards?\" A student of Latino descent sitting in front of Christian then turned around and claimed he would beat Christian up for that remark, as Blaze News previously reported.\n\n\"In my line of work ... this is the battle, and this is how we win.\"\n\nThe entire incident seemed to have been blown out of proportion from the jump. Leah McGhee explained to Sara Gonzales that the boys were on \"friendly\" terms and were just teasing one another.\n\n\"This was two 16-year-old boys just going back and forth,\" Leah McGhee said.\n\nThe assistant principal, however, apparently insisted that Christian's question had clear racist undertones. According to Leah McGhee, despite the Latino student's statement that he took no actual offense to the term \"illegal alien,\" the assistant principal replied, \"No, sir. This is a big deal, and this does matter.\" He even likened the term to \"using the N-word,\" Mrs. McGhee told Gonzales.\n\nBoth boys were later suspended. Christian received a three-day, out-of-school suspension for violating the school's code regarding racism, and the Latino student was given a one-day, in-school suspension for verbalizing threats.\n\nLeah McGhee claimed that she, her husband, and Christian have made several overtures to explain their side of the story to school administrators and the district. She even offered to meet with the Latino student, his mother, and the teacher to clear the air.\n\nTo no avail. Not only was Christian suspended from school, but his track coach forbade him from competing in two meets, jeopardizing Christian's chances of earning a college scholarship.\n\nBut the McGhee family continues to fight against the racism label that was added to Christian's permanent record. They joined forces with the Liberty Justice Center, which filed a lawsuit against the Davidson County Board of Education, claiming the school had violated Christian's First and 14th Amendment rights.\n\n\"Schools are government,\" attorney Dean McGee told Sara. \"And in this case, you have the government branding this kid a racist, depriving him of his right to an education for three days, depriving him of his ability to participate in track, and telling him there are no appeals permitted.\"\n\n\"We don't want kids being scared to ask questions in class.\"\n\nGonzales is likewise indignant that the school apparently wants to \"tar and feather\" Christian and \"put a scarlet letter\" on him over a term that is regularly used in federal law and in media. She also believes that lawsuits such as the one filed by the McGhees are the way that families with traditional beliefs and values will \"win\" against ideologically driven school districts and administrators.\n\n\"In my line of work, for me,\" Sara explained, \"this is the battle, and this is how we win: We file lawsuits against all of these people.\"\n\nThe full segment with Leah McGhee will air on Thursday night, but you can check out a preview of it below.

The student purportedly asked his teacher, \"like, space aliens or illegal aliens without green cards?\"\n\nCentral Davidson allegedly claimed the question was \"racially insensitive.\"\n\nThree days out of school suspension is a big deal, and it's especially a big deal if you are marked and branded by your school as having made a racist comment,\" Dean McGee, who represents the student with the Liberty Justice Center law firm, told Crisis in the Classroom. \"It's kind of hard to think of something worse to be on your permanent record as you're applying to colleges, as you're just going through life as a kid in school.\"\n\nFollowing the student's comment, his Hispanic classmate threatened to beat him up, according to McGhee. The suspended student refuted Central Davidson's claim the question was disrespectful to Hispanic classmates.\n\n\"I didn't make a statement directed towards anyone; I asked a question,\" the student said, according to McGhee. \"I wasn't speaking of Hispanics because everyone from other countries need[s] green cards, and the term 'illegal alien' is an ACTUAL term that I hear on the news and can find in the dictionary.\"\n\nThis phrase, 'illegal alien,' is on its face racially neutral.

And that has due process problems on its face,\" McGee said. \"For the school to punish [the student] for racism - for a neutral comment - is a clear violation of his First Amendment rights.

To access the content, check your email and follow the instructions provided.\n\nDean McGee is \"in it for the long haul\" to find justice for the McGhee family after their 16-year-old son was suspended for using the term \"illegal alien\" at his North Carolina school.\n\nIn April, Christian McGhee was suspended for three days after asking a teacher whether her reference to the word \"aliens\" referred to \"space aliens, or illegal aliens who need green cards.\" After a student allegedly threatened to \"kick his a -- \" for using the term, Christian was referred to the assistant principal who concluded it was a \"racially motivated comment which disrupts class.\"\n\nIn response, the Liberty Justice Center, where McGee works as the Education Freedom Attorney, announced a lawsuit against the Davidson County Board of Education on behalf of the family on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News Digital, McGee described the school as effectively attributing racism when it wasn't there.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT SUSPENDED OVER USING THE TERM 'ILLEGAL ALIEN': REPORT\n\n\"It's the assistant principal, the administrator, who elevated this to a racial incident where one did not exist. The boy who responded to our client said, 'hold on, I wasn't really offended. This isn't a big deal.' And the words of the assistant principal, these are his own words, explained what he said to our client's mother, 'No, sir. Those words are a big deal,'\" McGee said.\n\n\"In other words, the assistant principal was telling this boy, well, you might not be offended, but you should be offended,\" he added.\n\nMcGee also recalled that Leah McGhee, Christian's mother, had suggested a mediation session between the two families and the faculty to discuss the situation rather than dole out punishment.\n\n\"And the assistant principal said no. Harsh punishment. Three days out of school suspension. That was his solution. Not empathy, not understanding, just punishing this child and branding him racist on his permanent record,\" McGee said. \"But the ironic result is a total lack of empathy toward either student, total lack of healing, lack of a learning opportunity, and just meeting out punishment, stigmatizing, branding a 16-year-old boy in a way that could harm his future if it's not fixed.\"\n\nAlthough the McGhee family has faced backlash and threats on the assumption that Christian said something racist, McGee noted that there has also been overwhelming support for the family.\n\n\"I don't mean to downplay the harassment and threats that my client and his mother received. But there's also been an outpouring of support, and I think that support just comes from a place of intuitive empathy for a kid who is being mistreated by his own school and in such a vicious way that has a potential impact on his future,\" McGee said.\n\nPublic opinion also appeared to take the McGhee family's side at the Davidson County Board of Education meeting Monday night. All but two speakers voiced their support for Christian McGhee and attacked the school board for failing to address his suspension.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA BECOMES 9TH STATE TO PASS UNIVERSAL SCHOOL CHOICE, THE FIRST TO DO SO WITHOUT GOP TRIFECTA\n\n\"You are not in any way, shape or form helping our students. By the way, if you squash a student's question, you squash education. I'm appalled, and you still got the smirk on your face. I so hope you get voted out,\" one speaker said.\n\nThe McGhee family is seeking a public apology from the school board on the matter and demanding that the suspension be removed from Christian's record. In the event the district court does not rule in their favor, they are prepared to appeal.\n\n\"Our organization has appealed in the past and won a case at the Supreme Court. We would be willing to do that here if it's necessary. We're in it for the long haul for this family,\" McGee said.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsay_kornick@foxnews.com", "name": "Lindsay Kornick", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_McGhee", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jordan McGhee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGhee_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McGhee family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davidson_County,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Davidson County, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_choice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School choice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Squash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2023/12/1024/512/High-school-students_sleeping-student.png?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9546926", "eventUri": "eng-9546926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The family wants monetary damages and for the suspension to be removed from school records.\n\n\"There is nothing inappropriate about saying aliens need green cards, and there certainly isn't a case for racism due to the fact that alien is not a race,\" Leah McGhee, Christian's mother, said during public comments at this week's Davidson County school board meeting.\n\nPublicity about the suspension has sparked national attention and outrage among some conservatives. Elon Musk, the owner of X, formerly called Twitter, has called the suspension \"absurd.\"\n\nThe Davidson County school system did not return email and telephone requests for comment Wednesday from The News & Observer.\n\nAsking teacher about 'illegal aliens'\n\nChristian was formerly a 16-year-old sophomore at Central Davidson High in Lexington, which is south of Winston-Salem and about 110 miles west of Raleigh.\n\nChristian is listed as C.M. in the lawsuit that was filed on the family's behalf by the Chicago-based Liberty Justice Family. His parents have been public about their son's suspension.\n\nChristian missed part of a vocabulary lesson in Haley Hill's English class on April 9 when he went to the bathroom, the lawsuit says.\n\n\"Upon his return to English class, the word 'aliens' was used during class discussion,\" according to the lawsuit. \"C.M. raised his hand and asked Ms. Hill whether the reference to aliens referred to 'space aliens or illegal aliens who need green cards.'\" Hill responded and said, \"Watch your mouth [C.M.].\"\n\nA Hispanic classmate joked he was going to kick Christian's \"ass,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nBoth students were called into Assistant Principal Eric Anderson' office. The classmate later told Christian he wasn't \"upset\" or \"offended\" by his question, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe following day, Christian received the three-day suspension from school. The track athlete was also barred from participating in the Senior Night home track meet.\n\nFamily says comment was not racially motivated\n\nThe lawsuit contains a copy of the school suspension notice, which says Christian \"made a racially insensitive comment, in class today, about an alien 'needing a green card.'\" The notice also accuses him of \"using/making racially motivated comment which disrupts class.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Anderson told Christian's parents that reversing the suspension would be \"unfair to the 15 other kids who have served [suspension] for saying the N word or anything else under the sun that's racially charged that creates a disruption in the classroom.\"\n\nBut the lawsuit denies that Christian's words were racist or caused a significant disruption. Instead, the lawsuit says \"alien,\" \"illegal alien\" and green card are common terms and that Christian made a \"factual\" and \"non-threatening\" statement.\n\nThe lawsuit says the family withdrew Christian from the school after receiving threats and being bullied and harassed about the suspension. He's now being home-schooled.\n\n\"School officials have effectively fabricated a racial incident out of thin air and branded our client as a racist without even giving him an opportunity to appeal,\" Dean McGee, Educational Freedom Attorney at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a news release. \"Fortunately, young people do not shed their First Amendment rights at school, and we look forward to vindicating Christian's rights here.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "t_keung_hui@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "T.

Did that violate the First Amendment?", "body": "A 16-year-old boy has kicked off a free speech debate -- one that's already attracting spectators beyond his North Carolina county -- after he was suspended for allegedly \"making a racially insensitive remark that caused a class disturbance.\"\n\nThe racially insensitive remark: referring to undocumented immigrants as \"illegal aliens.\" Invoking that term would produce the beginning of a legal odyssey, still in its nascent stages, in the form of a federal lawsuit arguing that Central Davidson High School Assistant Principal Eric Anderson violated Christian McGhee's free speech rights for temporarily barring him from class over a dispute about offensive language.\n\nWhat constitutes offensive speech, of course, depends on who is evaluating. During an April English lesson, McGhee says he sought clarification on a vocabulary word: aliens. \"Like space aliens,\" he asked, \"or illegal aliens without green cards?\" In response, a Hispanic student -- another minor whom the lawsuit references under the pseudonym \"R.\" -- reportedly joked that he would \"kick [McGhee's] ass.\"\n\nThe exchange prompted a meeting with Anderson, the assistant principal. \"Mr. Anderson would later recall telling [McGhee] that it would have been more 'respectful' for [McGhee] to phrase his question by referring to 'those people' who 'need a green card,'\" McGhee's complaint notes. \"[McGhee] and R. have a good relationship. R. confided in [McGhee] that he was not 'crying' in his meeting with Anderson\" -- the principal allegedly claimed R. was indeed in tears over the exchange -- \"nor was he 'upset' or 'offended' by [McGhee's] question. R. said, 'If anyone is racist, it is [Mr. Anderson] since he asked me why my Spanish grade is so low' -- an apparent reference to R.'s ethnicity.\"\n\nMcGhee's peer received a short in-school suspension, while McGhee was barred from campus for three days. He was not permitted an appeal, per the school district's policy, which forecloses that avenue if a suspension is less than 10 days. And while a three-day suspension probably doesn't sound like it would induce the sky to fall, McGhee's suit notes that he hopes to secure an athletic scholarship for college, which may now be in jeopardy.\n\nSo the question of the hour: If the facts are as McGhee construed them, did Anderson violate the 16-year-old's First Amendment rights? In terms of case law, the answer is a little more nebulous than you might expect. But it still seems that vindication is a likely outcome (and, at least in my opinion, rightfully so).\n\nWhere the judges fall may come down to a 60s-era ruling -- Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District -- in which the Supreme Court sided with two students who wore black armbands to their public school in protest of the Vietnam War. \"It can hardly be argued,\" wrote Justice Abe Fortas for the majority, \"that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.\"\n\nThe Tinker decision carved out an exception: Schools can indeed seek to discourage and punish \"actually or potentially disruptive conduct.\" Potentially is a key word here, as Vikram David Amar, a professor of law at U.C. Davis, and Jason Mazzone, a professor of law at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, point out in Justia. In other words, under that decision, the disruption doesn't actually have to materialize, just as, true to the name, an attempted murder does not materialize into an actual murder. But just as the government has a vested interest in punishing attempted crimes, so too can schools nip attempted disruptions in the bud.\n\n\"Yet all of this points up some problems with the Tinker disruption standard itself,\" write Amar and Mazzone. \"What if the likelihood of disruption exists only by virtue of an ignorance or misunderstanding or hypersensitivity or idiosyncrasy on the part of (even a fair number of) people who hear the remark? Wouldn't allowing a school to punish the speaker under those circumstances amount to a problematic heckler's veto?\"\n\nThat would seem especially relevant here for a few reasons. The first: If McGhee's account of his interaction with Anderson is truthful, then it was essentially Anderson who retroactively conjured a disruption that, per both McGhee and R., didn't actually occur in any meaningful way. In some sense, a disruption did come to fruition, and it was allegedly manufactured by the person who did the punishing, not the ones who were punished.\n\nBut the second question is the more significant one: If McGhee's conduct -- merely mentioning \"illegal aliens\" -- is found to qualify as potentially disturbance-inducing, then wouldn't any controversial topic be fair game for public schools to censor? If a \"disruption\" is defined as anything that might offend, then we're in trouble, as the Venn diagram of \"things we all agree on as a nation\" is essentially two lonely circles at this point. That is especially difficult to reconcile with the Supreme Court's ruling in Tinker, which supposedly exists as a bulwark against state-sanctioned viewpoint discrimination and censorship.\n\nIt is also difficult to reconcile with the fact that, up until a few years ago, \"illegal alien\" was an official term the government used to describe undocumented immigrants. The Library of Congress stopped using the term in 2016, and President Joe Biden signed an executive order advising the federal government not to use the descriptor in 2021. To argue that three years later the term is now so offensive that a 16-year-old should know not to invoke it requires living in an alternate reality.\n\nThose who prefer to opt for less-charged descriptors over \"illegal alien\" -- I count myself in that camp -- should also hope to see McGhee vindicated if his account withstands scrutiny in court. Most everything today, it seems, is political, which means a student with a more liberal-leaning lexicon could very well be the next one suspended from school.", "source": {"uri": "reason.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reason"}, "authors": [{"uri": "billy_binion@reason.com", "name": "Billy Binion", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(punishment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suspension (punishment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Anderson_(wrestler)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ken Anderson (wrestler)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Green card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Davidson_High_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Davidson High School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Case law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_v._Des_Moines_Independent_Community_School_District", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tinker v.

An assistant principal at the school is also named in the suit.\n\nThe boy, Christian McGhee, asked a clarifying question in class that resulted in \"a harsh suspension and false accusations of racism by his own school,\" according to the Liberty Justice Center.\n\nMcGhee was excused to use the restroom during his English class April 9, according to the complaint. When he returned to class, the word \"aliens\" was being used in a class discussion.\n\nHe raised his hand and asked if aliens referred to \"space aliens or illegal aliens who need green cards,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAfterward, McGhee and a Hispanic classmate were questioned about the incident. The plaintiffs claim the Hispanic classmate was not offended, and they say McGhee's comment didn't cause a disruption.\n\nBut the complaint states that the school suspended the boy three days for allegedly making a racially insensitive remark that caused a class disturbance.\n\nThe complaint states that the school justified McGhee's suspension by comparing his situation to suspensions given to other students \"for saying the N word or anything else under the sun that's racially charged that creates a disruption in the classroom.\"\n\n\"Even though Christian asked a factual, non-threatening question -- about a word the class was discussing -- the school board branded him with false accusations of racism,\" Buck Dougherty, senior counsel at the Liberty Justice Center, said in a news release. \"The school has not only violated his constitutional right to free speech, but also his right to due process and his right to access education, a guaranteed right under North Carolina law. We are proud to stand beside Christian and his family in challenging this egregious violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\"\n\nThey're seeking the removal of the suspension from his record, a public apology and monetary damages.\n\nOne free speech expert who isn't involved in the case said the school, based on the details in the complaint, appears to be on \"relatively unstable ground.\"\n\nThis could be a winning case for the family, said Steven Collis, a law professor and the director of the Bech-Loughlin First Amendment Center at the University of Texas.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held for decades that students don't shed their constitutional rights when they enter the schoolhouse gates.\n\nSchools can regulate speech in narrow circumstances, Collis said. A school can regulate speech that's vulgar and offensive, he said.\n\n\"But I think the school is going to have a difficult time succeeding on that argument here,\" Collis said.\n\nDifferent \"discourse communities\" across the country find different words or phrases offensive or racially insensitive.\n\nUnlike the N-word, there isn't widespread opinion that \"illegal aliens\" is offensive.\n\n\"The problem you have is that outside of their discourse community, there's a whole bunch of other discourse communities,\" Collis said. \"Some completely reject that interpretation of the word 'alien' on political grounds, and others don't even know that it is an offensive term.\"\n\nThe term also carries \"a pretty powerful political connotation,\" so Collis said one could argue that the school punished a political viewpoint.\n\nSchool policies aside, Collis said the labels \"racial language\" or \"racially insensitive language\" are legally meaningless.\n\n\"Outside of the schoolhouse, there is no category of speech called racially insensitive speech that government can then regulate,\" he said. \"People say racially insensitive things all the time. They say explicitly, blatantly bigoted things all the time, and our First Amendment allows that to happen. The assumption under our First Amendment is that we can handle it. As human beings, we can handle that. And we combat that type of insensitive or offensive speech with more speech.\"", "source": {"uri": "wgxa.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGXA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cory_smith@wgxa.tv", "name":

I miss my child like you could not even imagine.\"\n\nMcGhee added that her son greatly misses his friends and his old school and that he was wrongly punished and put \"in danger\" due to how the school administrators \"would not take accountability to the fact they were wrong.\" She also said administrators have missed an opportunity to teach students to correct themselves and take accountability when they are in the wrong.\n\nIn the wake of her son being accused of racism, McGhee said she and her family have received an outpouring of support from former President Donald Trump, who wrote a letter of recommendation for her son.\n\nTrump had also invited the family to his rally in North Carolina, though McGhee clarified that they were unable to meet Trump himself, as the event was canceled due to storms.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nOther major politicians who have backed the McGhee family include North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson and state Sen. Carl Ford.\n\nThe Liberty Justice Center filed a lawsuit on behalf of Christian McGhee against the Davidson County Board of Education on Tuesday over his suspension. The nonprofit litigation center is perhaps best known for representing Mark Janus in Janus v.

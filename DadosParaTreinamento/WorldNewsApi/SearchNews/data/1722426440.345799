The presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s list of false claims is \u201cway, way longer\u201d than the president\u2019s, Dale noted before reeling off and then debunking the many, many falsehoods uttered by Trump. Dale, during his near-3-minute segment, described Trump\u2019s claim that Biden wants to quadruple people\u2019s taxes as \u201cpure fiction\u201d and said his line about Biden only creating jobs for \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d was \u201ctotal nonsense.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, who moderated the debate, were criticised for not fact-checking Trump\u2019s false claims in real time for the audience\u2019s benefit. The network did, however, run a live fact-check on its website. Per CNN\u2019s analysis, Trump made more than 30 false claims during the head-to-head compared to Biden\u2019s \u201cat least nine false or misleading claims.\u201d", "summary": "<script>!function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document,c=n.createElement('script');c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document);</script><script id=\"667fa570e4b0d079dd45ba25\">(new Image()).src = 'https://capi.connatix.com/tr/si?token=ff7fdddc-5441-4253-abc4-f12a33fad58b';cnx.cmd.push(function(){cnx({\"playerId\":\"ff7fdddc-5441-4253-abc4-f12a33fad58b\",\"mediaId\":\"7d38add5-7fbe-4dff-a38f-4ffafb489223\"}).render(\"667fa570e4b0d079dd45ba25\");});</script><div class=\"content-list-component text\"><p><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/cnn\">CNN</a>\u00a0fact-checker\u00a0<a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/topic/daniel-dale\">Daniel Dale</a> offered a breathless breakdown of the misleading claims and false statements that former President Donald Trump made during his first 2024 presidential", "url": "https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/total-nonsense-and-pure-fiction-cnn-fact-checker-exposes-trumps-false-debate-claims_uk_667fa570e4b0d079dd45ba24", "image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/667e632025000031007c1b34.jpeg?cache=neSSKp1ZEJ&ops=1778_1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:16:13", "author": "Lee Moran", "authors": ["Lee Moran"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.115}

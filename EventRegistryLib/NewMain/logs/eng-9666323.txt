He had been on the IL since April 13 (backdated to April 10) because of right shoulder inflammation.\n\nThe Dodgers are getting Miller back at the perfect time, as they lost Yoshinobu Yamamoto to the injured list on Sunday and Walker Buehler is expected to be sidelined as well. L.A. will go another long stretch without being fully healthy, but at least they have one of their more reliable pieces back in the mix on a regular basis.\n\nMiller spoke about his readiness to return and the process of being away for so long, via Dennis Georgatos of the Southern California News Group:\n\n\"I feel really good, really excited for tomorrow,\" Miller said Tuesday. \"It's been a long 2\u00bd months, but I'm feeling really healthy, happy to be back in a major league game.\"\n\nThe results in Miller's rehab starts left something to be desired -- 13 earned runs over 15 innings total -- but he is less concerned about that and more focused on feeling healthy:\n\n\"I felt like I was getting healthier each time out there, and tried not to worry too much about the results in a rehab game,\" Miller said. \"Obviously, I want the results to be good but not think too much of it. If I come out of it feeling really good, that's what matters most. You get to the major league game, it's going to be a little different, and I expect to do good out there.\"\n\nAnd while there were some concerns about bringing Miller back at Coors Field -- a notorious hitter's park -- for his first start, it's another issue that doesn't phase the young star:\n\n\"That's what I did here last year and it was one of my best starts of the year,\" Miller said. \"Knowing that it is Coors, I know my changeup will play really good and that's my best pitch anyway, so that's a plus for me.\"\n\nBy all accounts, it seems Miller is ready to take on the challenge of getting back into big league action. Both he and the Dodgers have been anxiously awaiting this return, and it will be exciting for the franchise to get one of their cornerstones back in the mix at a necessary time.\n\nMiller threw a combined 15 innings and allowed 14 runs (13 earned) but managed to avoid surrendering a homer during his four rehab starts. He went 0-2 with a 7.80 ERA and 1.80 WHIP in those outings.", "source": {"uri": "s22927.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ron_gutterman@s22927.pcdn.co", "name": "Ron Gutterman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancho_Cucamonga,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rancho Cucamonga, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rancho Cucamonga, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Orthopedic", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Bobby-Miller-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666323", "eventUri": "eng-9666323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-13", "textStart": 387, "textEnd": 395}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-10", "textStart": 410, "textEnd": 418}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

He allowed 19 hits, but no home runs.\n\n\"Physically he's in a good spot. He's built up.

That included a career-best 11 strikeouts on March 29 against the Cardinals, then allowing seven runs in 5\u2154 innings over his next two starts before landing on the injured list.\n\nMiller takes the active roster spot of Walker Buehler, who was placed on the 15-day injured list with right hip inflammation.\n\nBuehler allowed seven runs in four innings on Tuesday night in the worst of his eight starts since returning to the rotation.

The corresponding 26-man roster move was not immediately announced.\n\nMiller, 25, hasn't pitched since April 10 due to shoulder inflammation. The young flamethrower made just three starts this season -- and never looked like himself -- allowing seven earned runs in 11.2 innings for a 5.40 ERA.\n\nMiller took over two months to heal, and will now finally be back on the mound for L.A. The Dodgers recently lost Yoshinobu Yamamoto to the injured list with a strained rotator cuff, and on Tuesday night, it was revealed that Walker Buehler could head back to the IL as his struggles continue.\n\nThus, Miller's return becomes especially important for a Dodgers team looking to continue to win without their superstar leadoff hitter, Mookie Betts.\n\nMiller made four rehab starts, allowing 13 earned runs in 15 innings for a 7.80 ERA. However, the Dodgers know he's ready to return, and are banking on him raising his level against big league competition.\n\nFirst pitch for Wednesday night's game is 5:40 p.m. PT.

He made two more starts, both abbreviated, before inflammation in his pitching shoulder landed him on the injured list. He'll be making his first appearance for the Dodgers since April 10 after completing a minor league rehab assignment.\n\n\"Physically, he's in a good spot,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"He's built up. I expect his focus will heighten now in a major league game. As far as on the rehab side, I don't pay any mind to the results on the rehab side.\"\n\nMiller acknowledged that he went through a bit of a rough patch as far as his pitching during his rehab assignment but physically he said he felt better every time out.\n\n\"I felt like I was getting healthier each time out there, and tried not to worry too much about the results in a rehab game,\" Miller said. \"Obviously, I want the results to be good but not think too much of it. If I come out of it feeling really good, that's what matters most. You get to the major league game, it's going to be a little different, and I expect to do good out there.\"\n\nHe'll have a bit of history going for him when he makes his return Wednesday night in hitter-friendly Coors Field. Miller had one of the strongest outings of his rookie season at Colorado last September, allowing two runs on seven hits in seven innings. He struck out nine and walked none.\n\nMiller said he would treat pitching in the Mile High City's thin air just like any other start.\n\n\"That's what I did here last year and it was one of my best starts of the year,\" Miller said. \"Knowing that it is Coors, I know my changeup will play really good and that's my best pitch anyway, so that's a plus for me.\"\n\nClayton Kershaw is set to take a major step in his return from offseason shoulder surgery.\n\nThe three-time Cy Young Award winner is scheduled to make his first minor league rehab start on Wednesday for Class-A Rancho Cucamonga.\n\nRoberts said Kershaw is slated to go three innings. Provided he comes out of the outing OK, Kershaw likely will stretch out by an inning or two during subsequent rehab outings.\n\n\"Then we'll kind of see where we're at,\" Roberts said.\n\nThe Dodgers have not formalized a timetable for Kershaw's return, but if all goes well, he could rejoin the team sometime in July.\n\nMiguel Rojas is making the transition from utility infielder to everyday player as the replacement at shortstop for injured All-Star Mookie Betts, who is expected to be sidelined 6-8 weeks after suffering a fractured left hand last weekend.\n\nRojas said he's prepared for a daily role because that's the approach he takes every season, whether he is going to be a starter or a backup.\n\n\"To be honest with you, this is what I prepare every offseason for, which is playing every day,\" Rojas said. \"I feel like I'm a natural shortstop. So, there's not much of an adjustment that I have to make right now. I just have to take care of my body a little better because the workload is going to be a little higher.\"\n\nStill, Rojas acknowledges the difficulty of stepping in for Betts and the difficulty his absence poses for the team as a whole.\n\n\"There's never a good time for one of your best players and one of the best players in the league to go down,\" Rojas said. \"Mookie is a guy who is very important to us, irreplaceable. So I feel for me, there is no way to replace someone like Mookie. But we can definitely, with the guys that we have on this team, hold it down until he gets back and helps us win the games we need to win late in the season and hopefully October.\"\n\nDodgers (RHP

His last start at the major league level was on April 10, after which he was shut down with shoulder inflammation. When he returns Wednesday, it will have been 70 days between starts.\n\nThe long road back felt like ramping up for a new season, Miller told Kirsten Watson of SportsNet LA on Tuesday in Denver, Colorado:\n\n\"It takes time to get everything back,\" Miller said. \"That's kind of what it felt like, just building up after an off-season. Everything's in the spot it where needs to be. I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nMiller told Watson he'd been dealing with shoulder inflammation ever since the team returned from Seoul, South Korea to begin its regular season in March.\n\nMiller didn't pitch in either of the Dodgers' games against the San Diego Padres; rather, he took the ball when the Dodgers played a Korean All-Star team on March 18. He allowed two runs in five innings that day, throwing 76 pitches in the Dodgers' 5-2 win.\n\nEach of Miller's next two starts went well, too -- a scoreless 4.2-inning effort agains the Angels on March 24 and a scoreless six-inning effort against the Cardinals on March 29 in his regular season debut. Things got worse from there.\n\nIn his second start of the regular season, Miller was rocked for five runs over 1.2 innings in the Dodgers' loss to the Cubs in Chicago's Wrigley Field, a homecoming game for the Illinois native. In his next start, April 10 in Minnesota, Miller allowed two runs in four innings, but labored a bit in the 73-pitch effort.\n\nMiller said he still isn't sure how or when he got hurt.\n\n\"I'm still trying to figure out what caused it,\" he told Watson. \"It all started right after Korea, and slowly just got a little bit worse, and started messing with my delivery a little bit, and mechanics were changing a little bit. I'm feeling 100 percent now, and just looking to stay that way the rest of the season.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: Jonathan Hui-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jp_hoornstra@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Jp Hoornstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Miller_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Miller (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_SportsNet_LA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum SportsNet LA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/USATSI_22901057_168396005_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666323", "eventUri": "eng-9666323", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-10", "textStart": 144, "textEnd": 152, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-18", "textStart": 930, "textEnd": 938}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-24", "textStart": 1134, "textEnd": 1142}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-29", "textStart": 1202, "textEnd": 1210}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

What was a 6-4 game in favor of the visiting team in the seventh became a Rockies win with a walk-off sac fly in the bottom of the ninth by Brenton Doyle.\n\nMore important than the result of this game was to get a feel for how Bobby Miller would look in his return. And despite not very exciting numbers, Miller did a lot of things well and showed promise for the rest of this season.\n\nContext is so critical in everything. If we were to say Miller had an outing in which he allowed five runs, that's not very flattering, but when you sit back and look at the bigger picture, there's so much positive to take away from this performance.\n\nThere was a bit of a d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as the Rockies once again did damage early with a three-run first inning backed by a two-out homer from Michael Toglia, and it was certainly no cheapie.\n\nMiller had to feel a ton of frustration, especially since he got the first two hitters he faced and the three guys who reached all did so with two outs.\n\nDespite these early struggles, the Dodgers' starter was able to keep things in check and cover the next five innings, allowing only one more run. The offense certainly helped Miller's confidence by regaining the lead in the next frame with a four-run rally, and adding on a couple more in the sixth, Shohei Ohtani being the biggest run producer of the evening with three of the six RBI.\n\nAnd as the seventh rolled around, even though his pitch count was in check, it might've been the time to take Miller out. LA was leading 6-4 and Miller had just pitched a one-two-three sixth, but in which two of the outs were hard-hit balls.\n\nPerhaps playing a riskier game with the bullpen, looking for any length he could get, Dave Roberts sent Miller back out there. That opened the door for Colorado to get back in the game as Sean Bouchard led off the frame with a double. The Dodgers might've been able to maintain the lead with Daniel Hudson coming in, but an error by Cavan Biggio and a double from Adael Amador later, all Brenton Doyle needed was to hit a sac fly to even the score.\n\nFive runs in six-plus frames isn't something to write home about, but for a guy who struggled heavily in his rehab outings and making his return in Coors Field, you appreciate the battle to go deep into this game. Given Yoshinobu Yamamoto is out for a significant while, getting Miller back and pitching well is all that more important.\n\nA significant note, especially for a team already dealing with more than its fair share of injuries, Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez was pulled from this game following a ground ball out in the seventh. After the game, Hern\u00e1ndez told reporters he was fine and planned to be in the lineup on Wednesday, as shown on SportsNet LA.\n\nThe Dodgers in the series finale on Thursday (12:10 p.m. PT, SportsNet LA) will face Ty Blach whose career 3.13 ERA facing the, is his best against any team he's faced more than three starts.

Few teams can succeed in the playoffs without at least a couple of legitimate frontline options. Too often in their recent October failures, the Dodgers have been short on elite-level pitching.\n\nRead more: Dodgers sacrifice short-term gains (a win Wednesday) for long-term goals (World Series)\n\nThis week, the team got a look at their best internal choices to handle such a task.\n\nHe pitched 5 \u2153 innings. He gave up two runs. Both scored after he left the game in a bases-loaded jam in the sixth.\n\nOver the first five innings, though, Stone again flashed his continued newfound dominance, further fueling his status as a potential frontline weapon.\n\nWhen Yamamoto went down last weekend -- his rotator cuff strain isn't expected to end his season, but leaves his ability to be an ace-caliber weapon in doubt for the time being -- there were immediate questions about what it would mean for the Dodgers' long-term pitching plans.\n\nTheir rotation was still headlined by Tyler Glasnow, an early-season Cy Young contender with a 3.00 ERA and MLB-leading 125 strikeouts.\n\nBut beyond that, it was unclear who could emerge as a true No. 2 option -- in the event Yamamoto doesn't regain form (or health) before the end of the season.\n\nWalker Buehler, the club's former ace, was struggling in his return from Tommy John surgery, even before landing on the injured list with a hip injury. Bobby Miller, a playoff starter as a rookie for the Dodgers last year, had his season sidetracked by a shoulder injury, then gave up five runs in his return to the rotation Wednesday.\n\nClayton Kershaw is nearing his own return, remaining on track for a late July/early August activation after pitching three innings with single-A Rancho Cucamonga on a rehab assignment Wednesday.\n\n\"He has blown through this,\" Roberts said of Kershaw. \"I hope it continues.\"\n\nBut relying on a 36-year-old veteran coming off his first career surgery represented a risky proposition.\n\nThe early outlook on a relatively weak trade market for starting pitchers doesn't provide many obvious external targets, either.\n\nThat's why Stone's ascension has been so welcome, giving the Dodgers not just another productive regular-season pitcher, but one who has increasingly flashed October-worthy stuff in the process.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Stone now has a 3.04 ERA, 13th-best in the National League. He has eight wins, trailing only Luis Gil of the New York Yankees for the MLB rookie lead.\n\nEven if the Dodgers insisted they didn't need one, he is blossoming as their best option to replace Yamamoto in the hierarchy of the rotation.\n\nOn Thursday, the 25-year-old wasn't impacted by the mile-high altitude, slightly altering his typically sinker-heavy pitch mix by going with more of a four-seam/changeup combination.\n\nUp until the sixth inning, he rarely faced stress on the bases, retiring 12 of his first 14 batters before stranding a pair of runners in the fifth.\n\nThe outing was also Stone's fourth in his last five starts with at least six strikeouts -- he hadn't done so previously since his season debut in late March -- a promising sign for a pitcher whose success was once dependent on limiting contact.\n\nRead more: Dodgers' Walker Buehler, still in 'search mode,' goes on injured list with hip injury\n\nHis ability to complement a trademark changeup with sliders, cutters and sinkers continues to be a boon, as well, alleviating the issues he faced in an up-and-down debut season last year when he largely relied on just three pitches.\n\nThere are still myriad boxes for Stone to check between now and the playoffs. As his loss of command in the sixth highlighted, there are many steps ahead him on the path to October success.\n\nNonetheless, his production has been a blessing for the Dodgers' banged-up pitching staff.\n\nUnless Yamamoto returns at full strength, someone will need to bolster the club's rotation.\n\nAnd of all the options available at this point, Stone is looking like perhaps their best bet.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotator_cuff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotator cuff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cut fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified_Pitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Modified Pitch", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/3ef9964523e7943667616c21c7f385c3", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666323", "eventUri": "eng-9666323", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Miller immediately ran into trouble in the first inning by giving up a three-run homer to Michael Toglia.\n\nMiller had retired the first two batters before yielding a two-out single and walk that extended the frame. The 25-year-old believes it would have been a different game if not for the free pass and poorly-located fastball, via SportsNet LA:\n\n\"Adrenaline was pretty high in the first inning. Got a couple quick outs but two-out walk, didn't really like that. And then the next guy, I just missed a fastball down the middle. I'd like to think if I throw it in a different spot, I only let up two runs instead of more, and it's a completely different ballgame. So really it just comes down to that one pitch pretty much.\n\n\"Fastball was a little flat today but that doesn't give me an excuse when I throw a fastball down the middle like that. That really kind of bit me.\"\n\nThere were some positives to take away from Miller's start as he got several ground ball outs and pitched into the seventh inning:\n\n\"I was getting a lot of ground balls, so I started leaning more toward the two-seam. Four-seam wasn't too great today, so I leaned a lot more toward the two-seam. It was getting a lot of success, besides a couple times I just missed it down the middle.

Few teams can succeed in the playoffs without at least a couple of legitimate frontline options. Too often in their recent October failures, the Dodgers have been short on elite-level pitching.\n\nThis week, the team got a look at their best internal choices to handle such a task.\n\nAnd on Thursday, in a 5-3 win over the Colorado Rockies, Gavin Stone showed glimpses of the dominance that could make him their best current alternative.\n\nStone's final line Thursday -- in a game the Dodgers got home runs from Shohei Ohtani, Will Smith and Freddie Freeman, plus three hits from Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez -- wasn't overwhelming.\n\nHe pitched 5 \u2153 innings. He gave up two runs. Both scored after he left the game in a bases-loaded jam in the sixth.\n\nOver the first five innings, though, Stone again flashed his continued newfound dominance, further fueling his status as a potential frontline weapon.\n\nWhen Yamamoto went down last weekend -- his rotator cuff strain isn't expected to end his season, but leaves his ability to be an ace-caliber weapon in doubt for the time being -- there were immediate questions about what it would mean for the Dodgers' long-term pitching plans.\n\nTheir rotation was still headlined by Tyler Glasnow, an early-season Cy Young contender with a 3.00 ERA and MLB-leading 125 strikeouts.\n\nBut beyond that, it was unclear who could emerge as a true No. 2 option -- in the event Yamamoto doesn't regain form (or health) before the end of the season.\n\nWalker Buehler, the club's former ace, was struggling in his return from Tommy John surgery, even before landing on the injured list with a hip injury. Bobby Miller, a playoff starter as a rookie for the Dodgers last year, had his season sidetracked by a shoulder injury, then gave up five runs in his return to the rotation Wednesday.\n\nClayton Kershaw is nearing his own return, remaining on track for a late July/early August activation after pitching three innings with single-A Rancho Cucamonga on a rehab assignment Wednesday.\n\n\"He has blown through this,\" Roberts said of Kershaw. \"I hope it continues.\"\n\nBut relying on a 36-year-old veteran coming off his first career surgery represented a risky proposition.\n\nThe early outlook on a relatively weak trade market for starting pitchers doesn't provide many obvious external targets, either.\n\nThat's why Stone's ascension has been so welcome, giving the Dodgers not just another productive regular-season pitcher, but one who has increasingly flashed October-worthy stuff in the process.\n\nIn 14 starts this season, Stone now has a 3.04 ERA, 13th-best in the National League. He has eight wins, trailing only Luis Gil of the New York Yankees for the MLB rookie lead.\n\nEven if the Dodgers insisted they didn't need one, he is blossoming as their best option to replace Yamamoto in the hierarchy of the rotation.\n\nOn Thursday, the 25-year-old wasn't impacted by the mile-high altitude, slightly altering his typically sinker-heavy pitch mix by going with more of a four-seam/changeup combination.\n\nUp until the sixth inning, he rarely faced stress on the bases, retiring 12 of his first 14 batters before stranding a pair of runners in the fifth.\n\nThe outing was also Stone's fourth in his last five starts with at least six strikeouts -- he hadn't done so previously since his season debut in late March -- a promising sign for a pitcher whose success was once dependent on limiting contact.\n\nHis ability to complement a trademark changeup with sliders, cutters and sinkers continues to be a boon, as well, alleviating the issues he faced in an up-and-down debut season last year when he largely relied on just three pitches.\n\nThere are still myriad boxes for Stone to check between now and the playoffs. As his loss of command in the sixth highlighted, there are many steps ahead him on the path to October success.\n\nNonetheless, his production has been a blessing for the Dodgers' banged-up pitching staff.\n\nUnless Yamamoto returns at full strength, someone will need to bolster the club's rotation.\n\nAnd of all the options available at this point, Stone is looking like perhaps their best bet.",

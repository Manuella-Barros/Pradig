His mugshot was also released.\n\nThe Miami Beach Police Department confirmed to USA TODAY that Scott was taken into custody on Thursday after an incident at the Miami Beach Marina. Officers responded to a disturbance on one of the yachts, where people were fighting on the vessel, according to the arrest affidavit.\n\nOfficers say they observed Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, standing by the dock and yelling at the occupants of the vessel. When officers made contact with the rapper, he \"began continuously standing back up,\" disregarding commands to sit down, and his breath smelled strongly of alcohol, according to police.\n\nPolice say they told Scott to leave, and although he initially did so, he soon returned, and officers observed him walking back toward the vessel. After he began yelling and \"becoming erratic disturbing the peace of the occupants of the marina and nearby residential buildings,\" he was taken into custody, the police report said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Scott for comment. As news of his arrest emerged, the \"Sicko Mode\" rapper simply posted on X, \"Lol.\"\n\nScott is scheduled to perform in the Netherlands on June 28 and June 30 as part of his Circus Maximus Tour.\n\nThe arrest comes almost three years after Scott faced scrutiny over a crowd surge at his Astroworld music festival, which left 10 people dead. The rapper did not face criminal charges in connection with the incident, with Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg saying last year that a grand jury found \"no crime did occur\" and \"no single individual was criminally responsible.\"\n\nIn a statement in 2021, Scott said he was \"devastated\" by the crowd surge, adding, \"My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival. Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Both musicians are in the midst of global tours.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_evans@deadline.com", "name": "Greg Evans", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zo\u00eb_Chao", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zo\u00eb Chao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amber_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amber Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Irwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Irwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Hecht", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Hecht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Middleditch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Middleditch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eureka, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eureka, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_AstroWorld", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Six Flags AstroWorld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WSVN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WSVN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus Maximus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Timberlake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sag_Harbor,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sag Harbor, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sag Harbor, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travis-Scott.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1774, "textEnd": 1781}], "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Music, in 2012. Travis Scott had already signed a major-label deal with Epic Records earlier that year, so he collaborated with G.O.O.D. Music as a producer.\n\n\"After getting his start via Kanye West's G.O.O.D. Music series, exploded onto the mainstream in 2016 with his Billboard 200-topping sophomore record 'Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight,' which he followed up two years later with 'Astroworld,'\" According to Billboard Music.\n\n\"The latter project spent three weeks at No. 1 and spawned one of his best-known songs to date, 'Sicko Mode,' which was all but inescapable in the second half of 2018. Thanks in part to collaborations with Drake, Young Thug, Kid Cudi, M.I.A., Kodak Black and Offset, Scott would go on to score a handful of No. 1 singles and even more top 10s.\"\n\nWhere, why was Travis Scott arrested?\n\nAccording to reports of Scott's arrest and the Miami Beach Police arrest affidavit, police were called to the Miami Beach Marina early Thursday, June 20, to respond to a disturbance on a yacht. Someone called the station to report that people were fighting on the boat.\n\n\"When officers arrived, they found Scott 'standing by the dock yelling at the vessel occupants.' At first Scott complied with police commands to sit down, but then he disregarded them,\" NBC's report on the arrest affidavit says.\n\n\"The complainant told police he did not want to press changes, and just wanted the rapper off of the vessel. Officers could sense 'a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant's breath.'\"\n\nAccording to the report, Scott agreed to leave but did not do so quietly and started to approach the boat again, only about five minutes later.\n\n\"During the walk to the boardwalk, Scott 'walked backwards yelling obscenities to the occupants of the vessel,'\" according to NBC's report on the arrest. After he left, he was seen walking back toward the boat again.\n\n\"Scott spoke to a sergeant he had spoken to earlier and began yelling once again -- 'becoming erratic' and 'disturbing the peace of the occupants of the marina and nearby residential buildings causing a public disturbance,' the affidavit said.\n\nHe was eventually arrested around 1:15 in the morning on Thursday, June 20 and later flippantly admitted that he had been drinking alcohol, saying \"It's Miami.\"\n\nScott submitted a $650 bond and is expected to be released.\n\nIs Travis Scott going on tour in 2024?\n\nThis arrest lands just eight days before Scott is slated to tour Europe this summer, which starts in the Netherlands.\n\n\"Travis Scott is headed overseas this summer for a run of European stadium and arena dates as part of his UTOPIA - Circus Maximum Tour,\" Billboard reported in May.\n\n\"The 12-show run is slated to kick off on June 28 with a show at the Gelredome in the Netherlands and include shows in Poland, Switzerland, France, Belgium, the U.K., Czech Republic and Italy.\"\n\nWhy does Travis Scott go by Travis Scott?\n\nScott revealed how he chose his stage name during an interview with Jimmy Fallon on \"The Tonight Show\" in 2018. It's a mix of his uncle's name and Kid Cudi's real name, which is Scott Mescudi.\n\n\"My uncle was named Travis and Kid Cudi is like one of my favorite artists of all time,\" Scott told Fallon.\n\n\"His real name is Scott Mescudi. And my Uncle's friends called him Scott, too, so it kinda worked out like that. It was like my two superheroes, you know.\"\n\nIs CACTI park owned by Travis Scott?\n\nIt's not that surprising that Scott was in South Florida when he was arrested this week. He has strong ties to the Miami metropolitan area.\n\nScott actually owns the spring training home of the Houston Astros, CACTI Park of the Palm Beaches, in West Palm Beach, only a couple hours north of where he was arrested.", "source": {"uri": "eu.palmbeachpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "eu.palmbeachpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOOD_Music", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "GOOD Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_AstroWorld", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Six Flags AstroWorld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kanye West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-again,_off-again_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-again, off-again relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Records", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_record_label", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_Mode", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sicko Mode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drake (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak_Black", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kodak Black"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trap_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trap music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.I.A._(rapper)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "M.I.A.

When they arrived, Scott was \"standing by the dock yelling at the vessel occupants.\"\n\nScott complied with a police request to sit down, according to the affidavit, but then \"began continuously standing back up disregarding officers commands.\"\n\nThe officers stated that they \"could sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant's breath.\"\n\nA police officer asked Scott to leave the dock after confirming the person who complained did not want to press charges and that Scott did not have property on the boat. Scott retreated from the scene, walking backwards and yelling obscenities to the people on the yacht, police said.\n\nScott then entered his car and according to police, said to the officers that \"if he gets in the vehicle he's gonna catch a fade\" -- a slang term implying physical repercussions.\n\nThe car left the property, but the affidavit states that Scott returned about five minutes later. A police officer saw Scott walking back toward the yacht while allegedly bypassing police and disregarded commands.\n\nAs Scott was speaking to an officer, he \"began yelling once again\" and became \"erratic,\" with his behavior causing a public disturbance. It was then that Scott was taken into custody.\n\nScott admitted that he had been drinking, adding \"It's Miami,\" alluding to the city's reputation for bacchanalian festivities.\n\nRepresentatives for Scott's label did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nIn a post on X shortly after he was released on bond, Scott stated simply, \"Lol.\" A post on his official Instagram account has photoshopped headphones and sunglasses onto his booking photo.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, 10 officers were using a body-worn camera during the incident.\n\nThis is not Scott's first brush with law enforcement. During several of Scott's concerts, the musician stirred controversy by riling up his crowds resulting in rowdy fan behavior.\n\nThose incidents reached new heights in 2021 when at least 10 people, aged 9 to 27, were killed and hundreds more injured during his Astroworld Festival. Scott was investigated for criminal conduct in that incident, but a grand jury declined to indict the Houston native.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alana_wise@npr.org", "name": "Alana Wise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroworld_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astroworld Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Dots_and_Boxes", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Dots and Boxes", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/01/17/gettyimages-1047626816_wide-3d077af6b9589f09fca2f41d80d1ca0bcc6cbeb9.jpg?s=1400&c=100&f=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-10-", "textStart": 43, "textEnd": 55}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

According to Miami Beach Police Department, the rapper was on a charter boat at the Miami Beach Marina when the incident occurred around 12:44 a.m. \"He was drunk, causing a disturbance and asked to leave multiple times,\" officers told Fox 7 News. \"The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, 'It's Miami,'\" per Scott's arrest form. When the rapper refused to leave, he was arrested and booked into Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center around 4:30 a.m. Scott, real name Jacques Bermon Webster, was charged with disorderly intoxication and trespassing property after warning.

Scott bonded out of jail at 8 a.m. Thursday, according to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County.\n\nCNN has reached out to Scott's representatives.\n\nScott is one of the premiere rap artists of the last decade and is perhaps best known for his rowdy live performances that have occasionally spun out of control, including a fatal Astroworld Festival show in 2021 that left 10 people dead.\n\nEntertainment\n\nTravis Scott gives interview for first time since Astroworld tragedy Sarah Dewberry 1:27 PM, Dec 09, 2021\n\nThe incident early Thursday began when Scott was on a charter boat and was involved in a disturbance/dispute with the crew, police said. Officers were called to the marina, and he was asked to leave. Scott left and came back a second time and again got into a dispute with the crew and was asked to leave again, and after he refused, he was arrested, police said.\n\nThe arrest affidavit offers some further details of the incident. According to the affidavit, police were called to the dock to respond to a report of people fighting on a yacht. Officers observed Scott yelling at the occupants, and officers could \"sense a strong smell of alcohol\" on his breath, the affidavit states.\n\nScott was told to leave or face arrest, and he then went to a vehicle and left the marina. He returned about five minutes later, disregarded officers' commands not to go toward the yacht, and \"began yelling once again, becoming erratic disturbing the peace,\" and was taken into custody, the affidavit states.\n\n\"The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, 'It's Miami,'\" according to the affidavit.\n\nThe affidavit further notes that 10 officers used body-worn cameras.\n\nScott had the most musical success with his 2018 album \"Astroworld\" and the No. 1 hit single \"Sicko Mode\" featuring Drake, which sampled from a remarkable array of sources. The album was nominated for a Grammy for best rap album, and \"Sicko Mode\" was nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.\n\nLast year, he released \"UTOPIA,\" which was nominated for best rap album, his 10th Grammy nomination.\n\nIn November 2021, Scott's Astroworld Festival show turned into a mass casualty event, as 10 people were killed and 300 were injured during his set in Houston as a crowd of about 50,000 surged toward the stage. Scott was not charged with wrongdoing in connection with the crowd crush. He and other organizers faced 10 wrongful death lawsuits and had settled all of them as of last month, according to CNN affiliate KHOU.\n\nThe rapper has been arrested at least twice over incidents at his concerts. The first was during a 2015 Lollapalooza performance, when police said Scott told attendees to climb over security barricades, according to CNN affiliate WLS. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct and was sentenced to one year of court supervision, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nIn addition, in 2017 after a show in Rogers, Arkansas, he was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor. Police said Scott \"encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols,\" which resulted in injuries. Two of the charges were dismissed in 2018, but Scott pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid over $6,800 to two people who said they were injured at his show, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported.\n\nHe shares two children with Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul and the youngest sibling of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

When they arrived at the scene, Scott was allegedly seen standing on the dock, screaming at the people on the yacht.\n\nMore from WSVN:\n\nScott was reportedly getting off a charter boat when the owner of the boat, who did not want to press any charges, requested him to leave. Officers noted that Scott initially complied by sitting down but repeatedly stood up, disregarding their commands.

Reports indicate that Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, was arrested on charges of disorderly intoxication and trespassing after allegedly causing a disturbance on a yacht at the Miami Beach marina.\n\nAccording to local authorities, the incident unfolded after they received a call about a disturbance involving people fighting on a yacht. Upon arriving at the scene, police claim they found Scott standing on the dock, shouting at individuals on the yacht. The situation escalated when Scott reportedly ignored police commands to leave the area, despite officers detecting a strong smell of alcohol on his breath.\n\nScott's interaction with law enforcement took a turbulent turn when he complied momentarily by sitting down but repeatedly stood up, prompting officers to issue warnings. Despite being told to leave the dock, Scott allegedly returned shortly thereafter, continuing to create a disturbance by yelling and screaming. This sequence of events ultimately led to his arrest around 1:44 a.m. and subsequent booking into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center.\n\nScott's Reaction and Aftermath\n\nFollowing his arrest, Scott was swiftly processed and spent several hours in jail before posting bail. Records indicate he submitted a bond totaling $650, covering charges for trespassing and disorderly intoxication. Despite the ordeal, Scott seemed unfazed by the incident, as evidenced by his casual response on social media shortly after his release.\n\nTaking to Twitter, Scott posted a simple \"Lol\" from his account, indicating a nonchalant attitude towards the events of the night. Additionally, he shared an edited photo of his mugshot on Instagram, adding sunglasses and headphones in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Sources close to Scott emphasized that there was no physical altercation during the incident and attributed the disturbance to a rowdy party atmosphere rather than intentional misconduct.\n\nScott, who shares two children with Kylie Jenner, has maintained a high-profile career in the music industry, characterized by his dynamic performances and loyal fan base. His arrest comes just days before he is scheduled to kick off his European tour, Circus Maximus, starting in The Netherlands. This timing raises questions about potential implications for his tour schedule and public image, although no official statements regarding tour adjustments have been issued as of now.\n\nConclusion\n\nTravis Scott's arrest in Miami serves as a reminder of the complexities of fame and the challenges that accompany public visibility. While the incident may have been fueled by alcohol and a charged atmosphere, Scott's immediate release and subsequent social media posts suggest a degree of resilience in the face of adversity. As he prepares to embark on his upcoming tour, all eyes will be on how Scott navigates the aftermath of this incident and whether it impacts his professional engagements moving forward. For now, the rapper's fans and the public await further developments while reflecting on the events that transpired during a chaotic Juneteenth night in Miami Beach.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_Mode", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sicko Mode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juneteenth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus Maximus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tongue-in-cheek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunglasses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sunglasses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travis-Scott-arrested-for-being-too-drunk-in-Miami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Scott briefly obeyed officers' commands to sit down and continuously stood back up, the affidavit said.\n\nPolice sensed \"a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant's breath,\" the affidavit said. The person who complained told officers he did not want to press charges, but wanted Scott off the boat. \"Through the long walk from the vessel to the boardwalk, the defendant walked backwards yelling obscenities to the occupants of the vessel,\" officers wrote.\n\nScott left the scene, but soon returned and headed back to the vessel, passing officers who ordered him to stop. Scott was then taken into custody after he began to yell, creating a disturbance, the affidavit said. After his arrest, Scott wrote \"Lol\" on social media and later said would continue his ongoing concert tour.\n\n\"6 days to circus Maximus tour,\" he said on X. Known for hits such as \"Sicko Mode,\" Scott has been nominated for 10 Grammys.\n\nIn 2021, 10 fans were killed and thousands injured after the crowd surged toward the stage at the artist's Astroworld Festival in Texas. The rapper told GQ magazine he was \"overly devastated\" by the incident.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hip hop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concert tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroworld_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astroworld Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_Mode", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sicko Mode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Broadcast syndication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/02_06_2024_23_24_21_9598758.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

When they arrived, Scott was \"standing by the dock yelling at the vessel occupants.\"\n\nScott complied with a police request to sit down, according to the affidavit, but then \"began continuously standing back up disregarding officers commands.\"\n\nThe officers stated that they \"could sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant's breath.\"\n\nA police officer asked Scott to leave the dock after confirming the person who complained did not want to press charges and that Scott did not have property on the boat. Scott retreated from the scene, walking backwards and yelling obscenities to the people on the yacht, police said.\n\nScott then entered his car and according to police, said to the officers that \"if he gets in the vehicle he's gonna catch a fade\" -- a slang term implying physical repercussions.\n\nThe car left the property, but the affidavit states that Scott returned about five minutes later. A police officer saw Scott walking back toward the yacht while allegedly bypassing police and disregarded commands.\n\nAs Scott was speaking to an officer, he \"began yelling once again\" and became \"erratic,\" with his behavior causing a public disturbance. It was then that Scott was taken into custody.\n\nScott admitted that he had been drinking, adding \"It's Miami,\" alluding to the city's reputation for bacchanalian festivities.\n\nRepresentatives for Scott's label did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nIn a post on X shortly after he was released on bond, Scott stated simply, \"Lol.\" A post on his official Instagram account has photoshopped headphones and sunglasses onto his booking photo.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, 10 officers were using body-worn cameras during the incident.\n\nThis is not Scott's first brush with law enforcement. During several of Scott's concerts, the musician stirred controversy by riling up his crowds resulting in rowdy fan behavior.\n\nThose incidents reached new heights in 2021 when at least 10 people, aged 9 to 27, were killed and hundreds more injured during his Astroworld Festival. Scott was investigated for criminal conduct in that incident, but a grand jury declined to indict the Houston native.", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroworld_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astroworld Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Body camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Office_Products/Furniture", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Office Products/Furniture", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Announcers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office_Suites", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Office Suites", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/72a819c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2931x1539+0+330/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.npr.org%2Fassets%2Fimg%2F2019%2F01%2F17%2Fgettyimages-1047626816-363789359922261b6540391f8fc2f75a684c5728.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Scott bonded out of jail at 8 a.m. Thursday, according to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Scott.\n\nScott is one of the premiere rap artists of the last decade and is perhaps best known for his rowdy live performances that have occasionally spun out of control, including a fatal Astroworld Festival show in 2021 that left 10 people dead.\n\nThe incident early Thursday began when Scott was on a charter boat and was involved in a disturbance/dispute with the crew, police said. Officers were called to the marina, and he was asked to leave. Scott left and came back a second time and again got into a dispute with the crew and was asked to leave again, and after he refused, he was arrested, police said.\n\nThe arrest affidavit offers some further details of the incident. According to the affidavit, police were called to the dock to respond to a report of people fighting on a yacht. Officers observed Scott yelling at the occupants, and officers could \"sense a strong smell of alcohol\" on his breath, the affidavit states.\n\nScott was told to leave or face arrest, and he then went to a vehicle and left the marina. He returned about five minutes later, disregarded officers' commands not to go toward the yacht, and \"began yelling once again, becoming erratic disturbing the peace,\" and was taken into custody, the affidavit states.\n\n\"The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, \"'It's Miami,'\" according to the affidavit.\n\nThe affidavit further notes that 10 officers used body-worn cameras.\n\nScott had the most musical success with his 2018 album \"Astroworld\" and the No. 1 hit single \"Sicko Mode\" featuring Drake, which sampled from a remarkable array of sources. The album was nominated for a Grammy for best rap album, and \"Sicko Mode\" was nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.\n\nLast year, he released \"UTOPIA,\" which was nominated for best rap album, his 10th Grammy nomination.\n\nIn November 2021, Scott's Astroworld Festival show turned into a mass casualty event, as 10 people were killed and 300 were injured during his set in Houston as a crowd of about 50,000 surged toward the stage. Scott was not charged with wrongdoing in connection with the crowd crush. He and other organizers faced 10 wrongful death lawsuits and had settled all of them as of last month, according to CNN affiliate KHOU.\n\nThe rapper has been arrested at least twice over incidents at his concerts. The first was during a 2015 Lollapalooza performance, when police said Scott told attendees to climb over security barricades, according to CNN affiliate WLS. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct and was sentenced to one year of court supervision, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nIn addition, in 2017 after a show in Rogers, Arkansas, he was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor. Police said Scott \"encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols,\" which resulted in injuries. Two of the charges were dismissed in 2018, but Scott pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid over $6,800 to two people who said they were injured at his show, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported.\n\nHe shares two children with Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul and the youngest sibling of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The 33-year-old Texan musician was charged by police with two charges: trespassing property (a yacht, in this case) and disorderly intoxication.\n\nThe rapper was reported to be drunk, but it is not known whether he had also consumed drugs. Florida law prohibits appearing drunk or on illicit substances; consuming alcoholic beverages in public places or on public transportation; and causing a disturbance. In addition to the arrest, Scott was fined $150 for disorderly intoxication and $500 for trespassing. As read in the official documents of the case, the musician told the police officers: \"It's Miami.\"\n\nThe incident took place at the Miami Beach Marina, a port south of the city's beach area, just before 2 a.m. Authorities were alerted to an incident on a yacht, which appeared to be a fight. When they arrived, according to an affidavit obtained by People magazine, Scott was \"yelling at the vessel occupants.\" Close sources told media outlets such as Page Six that \"there was no physical altercation\"; he screamed and the yacht owners (whose identity is unknown) wanted to throw him off the boat.\n\n\"Officers made contact with [Scott] to conduct an investigation,\" the affidavit reads. \"The defendant was asked by officers to sit down, at which point [he] temporarily sat down and then began continuously standing back up, disregarding officers' commands. Throughout the interaction, officers on scene could sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendants' breath.\"\n\nThe owners of the yacht did not want to press charges, they only asked the rapper to get off the boat, and leave the dock. The police also asked him to leave. But according to the affidavit, during the walk from the vessel to the boardwalk, Scott walked backwards and yelled \"obscenities\" to the occupants of the yacht. In fact, Scott returned just five minutes later, ignoring both the police and owners' calls for him to leave. \"[Scott] began yelling once again, becoming erratic, disturbing the peace of the occupants of the marina and nearby residential buildings, causing a public disturbance.\" It is at this point that police decide to arrest him and take him back to the station.\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II -- the artist's real name -- was taken to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center at 4:35 a.m. No further charges or investigation are expected as the fine has been paid. The performer is about to start an ambitious tour called Circus Maximus that will take him to around 20 European cities. The tour, which begins on June 28, will present his latest album, Utopia, which has been very well received. For the moment, it is not likely that the arrest will affect the concert dates.\n\nThe rapper, who has been nominated for a Grammy 10 times, is known for his erratic behavior, with many even calling him megalomaniac. For his upcoming tour, he wanted to perform in the Pyramids of Giza, but Egypt did not support the plan, arguing that the \"strange rituals\" that the rapper allegedly performs during his live performances go against \"Egyptian and Arab customs and traditions.\"\n\nThe rapper's most tragic concert took place November 2021, when an avalanche killed 10 people and injured dozens more during his performance at the Astroworld festival in Houston (Texas). After the tragedy, Scott said in a statement that he was \"absolutely devastated\" and promised to cover the funeral expenses of the victims. Scott's shows are known for being chaotic and disorderly, and in this case, it got out of hand. Security forces, who had a 56-page plan (and 20 ambulances at the gate, although more than 60 were needed) were unable to deal with what happened to the 50,000 attendees. Nearly 60 lawsuits were filed. Scott did not face criminal charges, but remains implicated in the civil cases because of poor organization of the event.", "source": {"uri": "english.elpais.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EL

The rapper, who has been no stranger to controversy in recent years, faced charges of trespassing and disorderly intoxication. He didn't seem all that shaken by the incident, though.\n\nJust before 2 a.m. on June 20, police officers arrived at the Miami Beach Marina following reports of a disturbance on a yacht. Per NBC News, officers found Scott \"standing by the dock yelling at the vessel occupants.\" Officers reported a strong smell of alcohol on Scott's breath.\n\nThe owners of the yacht did not want to press charges and after officers threatened him with arrest, Scott left the dock while \"yelling obscenities to the occupants of the vessel.\" He didn't leave the marina for long, though. Within five minutes, officers spotted Scott walking back toward the yacht, where he began yelling again.\n\nAccording to the affidavit, Scott was \"becoming erratic\" and \"disturbing the peace of the occupants of the marina and nearby residential buildings causing a public disturbance.\" At this point, officers arrested him. Scott admitted he had been drinking, reportedly noting, \"It's Miami.\"\n\nScott bonded out of jail and left later Thursday morning. That same day, Scott posted \"Lol\" on X before posting about an upcoming tour date.\n\nScott has landed in legal trouble in the years before this incident. In 2015, he was arrested for disorderly conduct at his Lollapalooza performance in Chicago. Per Billboard, Scott encouraged fans to jump over security barricades. Though he left the scene, he was arrested shortly after his performance.\n\nIn 2017, Scott was arrested on charges of inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, and endangering the welfare of a minor after encouraging the crowd at an Arkansas concert to rush the stage (per AP News).\n\nIn 2021, Scott hosted his Astroworld music festival in Houston. During his performance, 10 concertgoers died and hundreds were injured as the result of crowd crush. Scott continued to perform even as people in the crowd shouted at him to stop.\n\nAttorneys representing the festival attendees filed lawsuits following the festival. Ultimately, though, Scott avoided criminal charges.\n\n\"In this instance, the grand jury of the 228th District Court of Harris County found that no crime did occur, that no single individual was criminally responsible,\" District Attorney Kim Ogg announced, per CNN. \"It is tragic that 10 innocent people were killed while trying to enjoy an evening of music and entertainment, something many of us do routinely and without a second thought to our safety. But a tragedy isn't always a crime, and not every death is a homicide. This grand jury's determination has no impact on the many civil lawsuits pending.\"", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Scott bonded out of jail at 8 a.m. Thursday, according to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County.\n\nCNN has reached out to representatives for Scott.\n\nScott is one of the premiere rap artists of the last decade and is perhaps best known for his raucous live performances that have occasionally spun out of control, including a fatal Astroworld Festival show in 2021 that left 10 people dead.\n\nThe incident early Thursday began when Scott was on a charter boat and was involved in a disturbance/dispute with the crew, police said. Officers were called to the marina, and he was asked to leave. Scott left and came back a second time and again got into a dispute with the crew and was asked to leave again, and after he refused, he was arrested, police said.\n\nThe arrest affidavit offers some further details of the incident. According to the affidavit, police were called to the dock to respond to a report of people fighting on a yacht. Officers observed Scott yelling at the occupants, and officers could \"sense a strong smell of alcohol\" on his breath, the affidavit states.\n\nThere was no physical altercation, a source close to Scott told CNN.\n\nScott was told to leave or face arrest, and he then went to a vehicle and left the marina. He returned about five minutes later, disregarded officers' commands not to go toward the yacht, and \"began yelling once again, becoming erratic disturbing the peace,\" and was taken into custody, the affidavit states.\n\n\"The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, \"'It's Miami,'\" according to the affidavit.\n\nThe affidavit further notes that 10 officers used body-worn cameras.\n\nScott had the most musical success with his 2018 album \"Astroworld\" and the No. 1 hit single \"Sicko Mode\" featuring Drake, which sampled from a remarkable array of sources. The album was nominated for a Grammy for best rap album, and \"Sicko Mode\" was nominated for best rap song and best rap performance.\n\nLast year, he released \"UTOPIA,\" which was nominated for best rap album, his 10th Grammy nomination.\n\nIn November 2021, Scott's Astroworld Festival show turned into a mass casualty event, as 10 people were killed and 300 were injured during his set in Houston as a crowd of about 50,000 surged toward the stage. Scott was not charged with wrongdoing in connection with the crowd crush. He and other organizers faced 10 wrongful death lawsuits and had settled all of them as of last month, according to CNN affiliate KHOU.\n\nScott has been arrested at least twice over incidents at his concerts. The first was during a 2015 Lollapalooza performance, when police said Scott told attendees to climb over security barricades, according to CNN affiliate WLS. He later pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct and was sentenced to one year of court supervision, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nIn addition, in 2017 after a show in Rogers, Arkansas, he was charged with inciting a riot, disorderly conduct and endangering the welfare of a minor. Police said Scott \"encouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols,\" which resulted in injuries. Two of the charges were dismissed in 2018, but Scott pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid over $6,800 to two people who said they were injured at his show, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat Gazette reported.\n\nHe shares two children with Kylie Jenner, the beauty mogul and the youngest sibling of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Miami-Dade County Jail records show that Scott -- born Jacques Webster -- was arrested for trespassing of property after a warning.\n\nBillboard has reached out to the rapper's attorney and reps, as well as the Miami-Dade police for comment.\n\nAccording to the cable news network, Scott (born Jacques Webster) was booked into Miami-Dade County Jail at 4:35 a.m. ET after being arrested at 1:44 a.m. He's facing trespassing of property charges along with disorderly intoxication. The outlet, citing jail records, reports that Scott has already submitted a $650 bond following his early morning arrest at the Miami Beach Marina.\n\nScott was on a charter boat and allegedly got into a dispute with another crew, CNN reported, citing law enforcement. Police were called, and he was asked to leave the scene, which he did. According to the affidavit obtained by the cable news network, police -- who were wearing body cameras -- saw the rapper yell at the crew on the yacht, and were able to \"sense a strong smell of alcohol\" on his breath. But he returned minutes later and allegedly started yelling at the crew again despite police telling him to not approach the boat, which led to his arrest.\n\n\"The defendant later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol and stated, 'It's Miami,'\" CNN quoted from the affidavit.\n\nScott appeared to have some fun with his mug shot after his release on Thursday morning. In an Instagram Story post, he added a pair of white headphones and brown shades to the photo.\n\nIt's not the first time the 33-year-old has had run-ins with the law. In 2018, he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct following allegations of inciting a riot at a Northwest Arkansas concert the year prior. The rapper is also entrenched in a litany of lawsuits tied to the 2021 Astroworld Festival, which left 10 people dead and more than 700 injured.\n\nThe final wrongful death lawsuit from the festival was settled in May. Terms of the agreement remain unknown. The family of 9-year-old Ezra Blount, who was killed in the Houston festival crowd surge, sued Scott along with Live Nation, Apple and more entities connected to Astroworld.", "source": {"uri":

He was later released on bond after paying a total of $650 on both charges, local news reported.\n\nMr. Scott, 33, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster II, was arrested at 1:44 a.m. on charges of trespassing and disorderly intoxication after the police were called to the marina and told that \"people were fighting on the vessel,\" according to the report.\n\nOnce there, officers found Mr. Scott yelling at passengers on the ship. The officers \"could sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from the defendant's breath,\" the report said; they led him down a dock and toward a boardwalk, with Mr. Scott walking backward and yelling obscenities along the way.\n\nMr. Scott got into a vehicle that was waiting for him but soon began walking back to the yacht, the report said, in defiance of the officers' warning to leave the premises. He was then taken into custody.\n\nAccording to the report, Mr. Scott later admitted he had been drinking alcohol \"and stated, 'It's Miami.'\"\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Scott posted on social media what appeared to be a doctored image of his mug shot, with sunglasses and earphones added. A spokeswoman for the rapper did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Scott is one of the most popular rappers in music today, with three No. 1 albums and a recent arena tour. His shows have a reputation for an extremely high-energy response from crowds, and in late 2021, 10 fans died as a result of a crowd crush at Mr. Scott's Astroworld festival in Houston, his hometown.\n\nLast year, a grand jury declined to criminally indict Mr. Scott and others involved in putting on the festival. But he and others, including Live Nation, the festival's promoter, and Apple, which livestreamed the show, have faced civil suits over those deaths.

When officers arrived at the scene, they observed that Scott was agitated, shouting at the boat's occupants. The affidavit notes that officers detected a \"strong smell of alcohol\" emanating from Scott's breath, indicating his inebriated state.\n\nDespite being instructed to vacate the premises or face arrest, Scott initially complied by departing in a vehicle. However, the situation took a turn when he returned to the marina approximately five minutes later. Disregarding the officers' explicit commands not to approach the yacht, Scott resumed his aggressive behavior, \"yelling once again, becoming erratic disturbing the peace,\" as stated in the affidavit. This act led to his immediate arrest.\n\nDuring the interaction with law enforcement, Scott reportedly admitted to consuming alcohol, justifying his behavior by stating, \"It's Miami.\" The affidavit also mentions that the incident was captured on body-worn cameras by ten officers present at the scene.\n\nScott, known for chart-topping hits like \"Sicko Mode\" and \"Fe!N,\" has been a dominant force in the rap scene over the past decade. His live performances have garnered both acclaim and controversy, with the most notable incident being the Astroworld Festival in 2021, which resulted in ten fatalities.\n\nThis recent arrest is not Scott's first brush with the law. He has a history of legal issues stemming from his concerts, including a 2015 arrest at Lollapalooza for encouraging fans to breach security barricades. In that instance, Scott pleaded guilty to misdemeanor reckless conduct and received a one-year court supervision sentence.\n\nSimilarly, in 2017, he faced charges of inciting a riot, disorderly conduct, and endangering the welfare of a minor after a show in Rogers, Arkansas. While two charges were dismissed, Scott pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid restitution to individuals claiming injuries from the event.\n\nAs news of Scott's arrest spreads, questions arise about the potential impact on his upcoming European tour, scheduled to commence on June 28 in the Netherlands. A $650 bond was posted for Scott's release, and he was let out of jail at 8 a.m. Thursday, according to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Miami-Dade County.", "source": {"uri": "popculture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebrity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_the_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breach of the peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroworld_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astroworld Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicko_Mode", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sicko Mode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollapalooza", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lollapalooza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disorderly conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers,_Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rogers, Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rogers, Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/06/20/06469510-79bc-450f-9949-285ceb40716d/travis-scott.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 2890, "textEnd": 2897}], "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Officers spoke to the complainant who stated that he did not want to press charges and just wanted the defendant off of the vessel,\" the report details.\n\nMiami Beach Police Sergeant Jorge Lemus instructed Mr. Scott to leave the dock, issuing a warning that he would be arrested if he did not comply. Officers indicated that the rapper \"walked backwards yelling obscenities to the occupants of the vessel\" while they were escorting him to the parking lot.\n\nAfter departing the premises, officers noted that Mr. Scott returned approximately five minutes later and was seen walking back toward the yacht, \"disregarding officers' commands\" not to board the vessel.\n\nMr. Scott continued to yell, \"becoming erratic [and] disturbing the peace of the occupants of the marina and nearby residential buildings causing a public disturbance,\" per the arrest affidavit.\n\nThe rapper was subsequently taken into custody and transported to the Miami Beach Police Department. According to the arrest affidavit, he later admitted that he had been drinking alcohol, stating, \"It's Miami.\"\n\nMr. Scott was transferred to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in Downtown Miami, where he was booked at 4:35 a.m. and later posted a $650 bond.\n\nMr. Scott -- who shares daughter Stormi, 6, and son Aire, 2, with his ex-girlfriend, Kylie Jenner -- faced a criminal investigation for his role in the deadly 2021 Astroworld Festival. Ten concertgoers were killed after a crowd surge erupted during the festival, hosted by the hip-hop artist at NRG Park in Houston on Nov. 5, 2021.\n\n\"I'm absolutely devastated by what took place last night,\" Mr. Scott said in a statement published on Twitter at the time. \"My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival.\n\n\"Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life,\" he continued. \"I am committed to working together with the Houston community to heal and support the families in need. Thank you to Houston PD, Fire Department and NRG Park for their immediate response and support. Love You All.\"\n\nAfter concluding the 19-month-long investigation, a Texas grand jury declined to indict Mr. Scott and other parties involved with organizing the festival on criminal charges related to the incident at the annual music festival, which the rapper founded in 2018.\n\nHowever, Mr. Scott was hit with a series of civil lawsuits filed by the victims of the tragedy, leading his attorneys to file a motion to dismiss the claims. His lawyers argued that Mr. Scott was not responsible for any of the safety planning duties pertaining to the festival, only the creative aspects, such as performing and curating additional talent.\n\nIn April, Texas State District Judge Kristen Hawkins, who oversaw the case, declined the motion to dismiss the music producer from the lawsuits. The judge had previously rejected lawsuits against rapper Drake, a guest performer at the event, and other individuals and companies involved in the festival.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com",

When police arrived, they allegedly found Scott highly intoxicated from alcohol and standing on a nearby dock yelling at people on the yacht.\n\nPolice asked Scott to sit down, but Scott repeatedly stood up and yelled at the people on the yacht while police were investigating. The yacht owner didn't want to press charges; they only wanted Scott to leave, police said.\n\nPolice escorted Scott away from the marina and told him not to return. Scott reportedly left in a vehicle that was waiting for him, but returned to the marina about five minutes later, police said, despite warnings not to do so. Police said Scott began yelling obscenities again in an area where people were sleeping.\n\nScott was detained and reportedly admitted to officers that he'd been drinking alcohol. He reportedly told police, \"It's Miami.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Scott has had run-ins with law enforcement. Scott, 33, faced a criminal investigation in Houston, Texas, after 10 people died in crowd surges at his Astroworld music festival.

The 10 people who died were among 50,000 who attended the festival.\n\nThose who died ranged in age from 9 to 27 years old. Roughly 300 people were injured and treated at the scene, and 25 were taken to hospitals. Those killed died from compression asphyxia.\n\nScott was also investigated but never charged in New York City after he allegedly got into a physical altercation with a sound engineer at the nightclub amid a heated argument, according to multiple reports.\n\nScott reportedly caused $12,000 in damage and reportedly damaged expensive sound equipment, including a speaker and video screen at the nightclub.", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goosebumps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goosebumps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami-Dade_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami-Dade County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Flags_AstroWorld", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Six Flags AstroWorld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asphyxia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asphyxia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightclub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nightclub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Radio/Scanning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Radio/Scanning", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Patches", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Patches", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/Travis-Scott-Mug-featured.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Ham.\"\n\nHe also seemingly trolled his arrest by sharing a photoshopped image of his mugshot with wire headphones and sunglasses on.\n\n\"lol,\" he tweeted shortly after the news broke.\n\nTen Miami Beach officers were called to the marina shortly after 1 a.m. amid reports of \"fighting\" when a yacht owner reportedly asked Scott to get off his boat.\n\nWhen they arrived at the scene, officers reportedly found Scott, 33, \"disturbing the peace\" by \"yelling\" at people and \"behaving erratically.\"\n\nPolice said there was \"a strong smell of alcohol\" on the rapper's breath and he continued \"yelling obscenities\" at the people on the boat as they tried to coral him back to his waiting vehicle.\n\nHowever, the \"Astroworld\" rapper allegedly refused to comply with police and was taken into custody for two misdemeanors: disorderly intoxication and trespassing.\n\nThe ordeal seemingly took a few hours as Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster, wasn't booked at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center until 4:35 a.m.\n\nAfter taking a glossy-eyed mugshot, the rapper posted his $650 bail and was released.\n\nDespite reports of a fight, a source familiar with the case told us that \"there was no physical altercation with anyone.\"\n\n\"This was a rowdy party, and Travis was already bailed out for a few hundred dollars. He is already home,\" they said. \"There will be no further action to be taken, as it was a minor incident akin to receiving a ticket with no injuries.\"\n\nWhile a rep for the Miami-Dade Police Department did not respond to Page Six's request for comment, they told local TV station WSVN that Scott was \"drunk, causing a disturbance and asked to leave multiple times\" before they showed up.\n\nScott -- who shares two kids with Kylie Jenner -- \"became irate, screaming profanities, left and returned to disturb some more,\" they claimed.", "source": {"uri": "pagesix.com", "dataType":

When they arrived, they found the Astroworld artist 'yelling' at people from the dock.\n\nThey arrested the 33-year-old rapper for two misdemeanors - disorderly intoxication and trespassing at the marina.\n\nCops interrogated him about whether he'd been drinking. Scott replied: 'It's Miami'.\n\nHe also responded to the night's chaos with a series of light-hearted tweets to calm fan fears about his upcoming tour, and an edited version of his bleary-eyed mugshot snapped in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\nTravis Scott was arrested overnight for allegedly causing a drunken altercation on a Florida yacht - and his hilarious response under police interrogation was recorded in an affidavit seen by DailyMail.com\n\nThe Houston-born rapper - who has two young children, Stormi and Aire, with Kylie Jenner - was arrested by police at the Miami Beach Marina (pictured from above)\n\nScott wrote 'lol' on X and shared his booking photo complete with photoshopped shades and earphones via Instagram stories.\n\nHe then told his fans that he will be going 'ham' on his tour - which means 'hard as a motherf*****r.'\n\nPolice said there was 'a strong smell of alcohol' on Scott's breath and that he had been 'disturbing the peace' of the marina by 'yelling' and 'behaving erratically' through the night.\n\nHe got into a 'fight' with people on a yacht at the marina, triggering the police response at 1.17am. Ten cops were dispatched to the scene for the mission of ushering him back to his vehicle - 'a long walk away' per the affidavit.\n\nThe Sicko Mode rapper could not be tamed, and continued 'yelling obscenities' at the vessel all the way according to police.

'Six days to circus Maximus tour. For the record I'm going. Ham,' Scott wrote on X.\n\nA source familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com the fight was verbal in nature and 'there was no physical altercation with anyone'.\n\n'This was a rowdy party and Travis was already bailed out for a few hundred dollars. He is already home,' they said.\n\nThey added that 'no further action' will be taken over the 'minor incident' they described as 'akin to receiving a ticket with no injuries'.\n\nKylie and Travis first broke up in October 2019 after sparking a romance in 2017.

A rep for the Miami PD told that outlet what happened next:\n\n\"He was drunk, causing a disturbance and asked to leave multiple times.\"\n\nThen, at one point after being asked to leave, Scott allegedly \"became irate, screaming profanities, left and returned to disturb some more.\"\n\nWhoa!!\n\nCops arrived quickly, and they officially arrested Scott at 1:17 a.m. His booking was then processed, and he was jailed for a few hours while the bond payment went through. Per Page Six, the rapper's team has yet to comment on the arrest. You can see his mugshot from the incident (below):\n\nAs far as music and the concert schedule goes, this arrest is bad timing for Travis -- just like Justin Timberlake's DWI arrest earlier this week was terrible timing for the Mickey Mouse Club alum.

The international superstar has a history in Miami.\n\nScott, whose legal name is Jacques Webster, was released from a Miami-Dade County jail after posting a $600 bond on trespassing and disorderly intoxication charges. At around 12:45 a.m., police were called to the Miami Beach Marina, 300 Alton Rd., after a caller said, \"There were people fighting\" on one of the yachts.\n\nREAD MORE: Rap star Travis Scott was arrested in South Beach. There was a yacht incident, police say\n\nPeople in Scott's circle told the Miami Herald, \"There was no physical altercation with anyone.\" The 33-year-old artist, who shares two kids with ex Kylie Jenner, posted \"Lol\" on social media platform X after his release from jail.\n\nHere are other moments Scott garnered attention while in the 305:\n\nPerforming at Rolling Loud\n\nIn 2021, Scott headlined Rolling Loud Miami, an annual hip-hop festival at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. The \"SICKO MODE\" rapper was supposed to appear at the festival in 2020, though it was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAccording to a social media video, Scott spotted a janitor hard at work and gave him a shout-out, directing someone in his entourage to give the guy some dough for his troubles.\n\n\"I want you to just take off the night ...You know what I'm saying? I'm giving 5,000 for my boy right here!\" Scott yelled out to the cheering crowd. \"Whoever told you to get a mop?! The only way he clocking in ... is if he can rage!!\"\n\nHe won court battle over crashed car\n\nIn December 2017, Scott was attending a bash thrown by Diddy at his Star Island mansion in Miami Beach, whose guest list included DJ Khaled, Halsey and celebrity chef Salt Bae. The \"goosebumps\" artist rented a 2012 Lamborghini Aventador from Super Cars, a company specializing in high-end luxury cars.\n\nAt one point, the sports car crashed and sustained \"extensive damage,\" according to court records. In a secret deal signed hours later, the entertainer agreed to pay a settlement of more than $90,000 for repairs. But Super Cars tried to bill him for extra money.\n\nScott sued in Miami-Dade Circuit Court, and a trial judge ruled in the rapper's favor. Super Cars appealed the decision, but in 2020, Miami's 3rd District Court of Appeal sided with Scott.\n\nHis first public performance after Astroworld\n\nIn May 2022, Scott took the stage at club E11even's Formula 1 party in Miami -- more than six months after several people died and hundreds more were injured in a stampede during his Astroworld Festival in Houston.\n\nAt the 45-minute show, which started at 3 a.m., Scott told fans that they \"better lose their [expletive] minds!\" Video captured the crowd joining Scott chanting \"[expletive] the club up,\" the chorus of \"No Bystanders.\" He also performed \"Antidote,\" \"Highest in the Room\" and \"Pick Up The Phone.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors":

Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center around 4.35am Thursday, per court records. He posted a tweet saying 'lol' hours later. The Houston-born rapper - who has two young children, Stormi and Aire, with Kylie Jenner - was arrested by police at the Miami Beach Marina at 12:44am.\n\nThe 33-year-old submitted a $650 bond - which includes $500 for the trespass charge, and $150 for disorderly intoxication. It's unclear if he has yet been released. The Astroworld rapper appeared bleary-eyed and expressionless in his mugshot, which has been shared by Miami Dade Corrections facility. He appeared to respond on social media with a tweet simply reading 'lol' at 8.45am Thursday.\n\nHis arrest involved an altercation with the owner of a charter boat, according to WSVN. Scott 'became irate screaming profanities, left and returned to disturb some more,' according to the outlet. The booking comes just days before his international Circus Maximus stadium tour, which kicks off June 28 in the Netherlands.\n\nScott was recently spotted enjoying a family vacation in St Tropez. He was pictured on a boat with his daughter Stormi and son Aire late May - kids he shares with his ex-girlfriend Kylie Jenner. The previous week, Scott was involved in a skirmish with Jenner's previous ex Tyga, 34, in Cannes.\n\nTravis and the Kylie Cosmetics founder, 26, have had an on-off relationship since 2017, but are currently not together. Kylie and Travis first broke up in October 2019 after sparking a romance in 2017. In February 2018, the two welcomed their first child to the world. In August 2021, it was confirmed that the duo were expecting baby number two together after rumors had circulated that Kylie and Travis had reportedly reconciled.\n\nIt was confirmed in January 2023 that Kylie and Travis had decided to breakup for a second time after rekindling their romance in 2020. This is not the first time that Scott has had run-ins with the law. The rapper is facing a civil lawsuit after 10 people died during a crowd surge at his concert in 2021.\n\nScott previously revealed he was 'devastated' by the Astroworld disaster, which occurred on November 5, 2021 concert in Houston, Texas. The musician told GQ he thinks about the disaster 'all the time' and has had 'rough moments' in the two years since as he worked on comeback album, Utopia. Those killed, who ranged in age from 9 to 27, died from compression asphyxia, which an expert likened to being crushed by a car.\n\nThe star revealed his heartbreak at his attempt at putting Houston on the map as a city to rival New York and Los Angeles and inspire children had been 'ruined' - after previously saying he wanted to be a 'hometown hero' and not a 'villain.' In December 2021, speaking out about the November 5 tragedy Scott sat down with podcaster Charlemagne Tha God for an interview.\n\nIn the interview, Scott blamed his 'in-ear' person for not urging him to stop the show sooner, and claimed that he wasn't aware of or responsible for the fatal stampede and crowd crush Scott said that he is '1000 percent' certain he did everything he could have to prevent the tragedy, and claims he didn't hear the screams and cries for help as the crowd went out of control. 'Things happen, you know, and it's just been such a time, and I'm just trying to just really figure things out,' he said when asked why he was breaking his silence. 'My heart wasn't there to be the villain -- I was there to be a hometown hero.'\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

winner claimed to have consumed just \"one martini\" before following his friends home in his car.\n\nElsewhere, it was previously announced that the trial for Astroworld's final wrongful death

It's unclear if he has yet been released.\n\nThe Astroworld rapper appeared bleary-eyed and expressionless in his mugshot, which has been shared by Miami Dade Corrections facility.\n\nThe booking comes just days before his international Circus Maximus stadium tour, which kicks off June 28 in the Netherlands.\n\nScott was recently spotted enjoying a family vacation in St Tropez.\n\nHe was pictured on a boat with his daughter Stormi and son Aire late May - kids he shares with his ex-girlfriend Kylie Jenner.\n\nThe previous week, Scott was involved in a skirmish with Jenner's previous ex Tyga, 34, in Cannes.\n\nTravis and the Kylie Cosmetics founder, 26, have had an on-off relationship since 2017, but are currently not together.\n\nKylie and Travis first broke up in October 2019 after sparking a romance in 2017. In February 2018, the two welcomed their first child to the world.\n\nIn August 2021, it was confirmed that the duo were expecting baby number two together after rumors had circulated that Kylie and Travis had reportedly reconciled.\n\nIt was confirmed in January 2023 that Kylie and Travis had decided to breakup for a second time after rekindling their romance in 2020.\n\nThis is not the first time that Scott has had run-ins with the law. The rapper is facing a civil lawsuit after 10 people died during a crowd surge at his concert in 2021.\n\nScott previously revealed he was 'devastated' by the Astroworld disaster, which occurred on November 5, 2021 concert in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe musician told GQ he thinks about the disaster 'all the time' and has had 'rough moments' in the two years since as he worked on comeback album, Utopia.\n\nThose killed, who ranged in age from 9 to 27, died from compression asphyxia, which an expert likened to being crushed by a car.\n\nThe star revealed his heartbreak at his attempt at putting Houston on the map as a city to rival New York and Los Angeles and inspire children had been 'ruined' - after previously saying he wanted to be a 'hometown hero' and not a 'villain.'\n\nIn December 2021, speaking out about the November 5 tragedy Scott sat down with podcaster Charlemagne Tha God for an interview.\n\nIn the interview, Scott blamed his 'in-ear' person for not urging him to stop the show sooner, and claimed that he wasn't aware of or responsible for the fatal stampede and crowd crush\n\nScott said that he is '1000 percent' certain he did everything he could have to prevent the tragedy, and claims he didn't hear the screams and cries for help as the crowd went out of control.\n\n'Things happen, you know, and it's just been such a time, and I'm just trying to just really figure things out,' he said when asked why he was breaking his silence.\n\n'My heart wasn't there to be the villain -- I was there to be a hometown hero.'", "source": {"uri":

When they arrived, they found the Astroworld artist 'yelling' at people from the dock.\n\nThey arrested the 33-year-old rapper for two misdemeanors - disorderly intoxication and trespassing at the marina.\n\nCops interrogated him about whether he'd been drinking. Scott replied: 'It's Miami'.\n\nHe also responded to the night's chaos with a series of light-hearted tweets to calm fan fears about his upcoming tour, and an edited version of his bleary-eyed mugshot snapped in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\nScott wrote 'lol' on X and shared his booking photo complete with photoshopped shades and earphones via Instagram stories.\n\nHe then told his fans that he will be going 'ham' on his tour - which means 'hard as a motherf*****r.'\n\nPolice said there was 'a strong smell of alcohol' on Scott's breath and that he had been 'disturbing the peace' of the marina by 'yelling' and 'behaving erratically' through the night.\n\nHe got into a 'fight' with people on a yacht at the marina, triggering the police response at 1.17am. Ten cops were dispatched to the scene for the mission of ushering him back to his vehicle - 'a long walk away' per the affidavit.\n\nThe Sicko Mode rapper could not be tamed, and continued 'yelling obscenities' at the vessel all the way according to police. When they got to his vehicle, he appeared to warn his security guard not to comply with police.\n\nReferring to his employee, Scott told officers 'if he gets in the vehicle he's gonna catch a fade' according to the arrest document.\n\nHe was eventually detained and taken to Miami-Dade Corrections facility where his bleary-eyed mugshot was snapped.\n\nThe chaos comes just days before the launch of Scott's international Circus Maximus stadium tour, which kicks off June 28 in the Netherlands.\n\nAfter being released he tweeted a second time to reassure fans the tour was still going ahead. 'Six days to circus Maximus tour. For the record I'm going. Ham,' Scott wrote on X.\n\nA source familiar with the situation told DailyMail.com the fight was verbal in nature and 'there was no physical altercation with anyone'.\n\n'This was a rowdy party and Travis was already bailed out for a few hundred dollars. He is already home,' they said.\n\nThey added that 'no further action' will be taken over the 'minor incident' they described as 'akin to receiving a ticket with no injuries'.\n\nScott submitted a $650 bond - which includes $500 for the trespass charge, and $150 for disorderly intoxication.\n\nThe rapper was recently spotted enjoying a family vacation in St Tropez with the kids he shares with ex-girlfriend Kylie Jenner - Stormi, six, and Aire, two.\n\nA week before this, he was involved in a skirmish with Jenner's previous ex Tyga, 34, in Cannes, and he's also facing a civil lawsuit after 10 people died during a crowd surge at his concert in 2021.\n\nScott previously revealed he was 'devastated' by the Astroworld disaster, which occurred on November 5, 2021 concert in Houston, Texas.\n\nTravis and the Kylie Cosmetics founder, 26, have had an on-off relationship since 2017, but are currently not together.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Now, the hip-hop sensation got arrested for intoxicated behavior in Miami.\n\nBefore his arrest, Travis Scott and the event's showrunners were facing ten wrongful death lawsuits, but they have successfully settled nine cases.\n\nAccording to new reports, Scott was arrested for disorderly intoxication and trespassing in Miami. He was booked into the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center around 4:35 am on Thursday but posted bail shortly after.\n\nThe \"Sicko Mode\" rapper submitted a $650 bond -- $500 for the trespassing charge and $150 for disorderly intoxication. A picture of his mugshot shared by Daily Mail captured Scott with an expressionless face.\n\nHis lack of emotions may stem from his arrest coming days before his international Circus Maximus stadium tour kicks off on June 28 in the Netherlands. The event comes three years after the Astroworld tragedy.\n\nAs reported by The Blast, Scott and those involved in the Astroworld music festival have made significant progress in the wrongful death lawsuits filed against them. In May, the defendants settled the ninth case scheduled for trial.\n\nNeal Manne, an attorney for Live Nation, confirmed the news in a statement, noting that he could not share details about the settlements because of a gag order. However, Scott's representative, Ted Anastasiou, echoed the rapper's happiness, saying:\n\n\"Mr. Scott is grateful that a resolution has been reached without the need for a trial. The confidential agreement will honor Madison Dubiski's legacy and promote improvements for concert safety.\"\n\nThe ninth case was filed by the family of the late Madison Dubiski, one of the victims killed in the deadly crowd surge.

The 33-year-old rapper was taken to the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center for processing.\n\nHe was released on $650 bond. Sources tell us the rapper is already home.\n\nIn the report, officers said they responded to a disturbance on a yacht at a marina.\n\nDispatch told police that the person who called said people were fighting on the yacht. Officers said once they arrived, they identified Scott standing by the dock yelling at the yacht occupants. The police said they spoke to Scott and was asked to sit down.\n\nScott temporarily sat down but \"then began continuously standing back disregarding officers commands.\" Throughout this interaction officers, police said they \"could sense a strong smell of alcohol coming from\" Scott's breath. The person who called police said he did not want to press charges but wanted Scott to be removed from the yacht and area.\n\nThe officers told Scott he would be arrested if he returned to the area.\n\nAs they walked away with Scott, officers said he continued to yell obscenities to the people on the yacht. Scott walked to a car waiting to drive him away but said to the officers \"if he gets in the vehicle he's gonna catch fade.\" Police said Scott left the area but then returned five minutes later.\n\n\"The defendant returned approximately five minutes after Officer Rodriguez observed the defendant walking back towards the vessel,\" the report read. \"The defendant bypassed officers in the parking lot of the Marina disregarding officers commands not to go. Once the defendant began speaking to Sergeant Lemus, the defendant began yelling once again becoming erratic, disturbing the peace of the occupants of the Marina and nearby residential buildings causing a public disturbance. The defendant also disregarded officers warning to not return to the Miami Beach Marina.\"\n\nThe officer said he became \"erratic\" and was \"disturbing the peace\" The report said Scott admitted to drinking alcohol and stated \"It's Miami\" to police when asked.\n\nScott has yet to comment on the situation.

The rapper was charged with trespassing property after being given a warning and disorderly intoxication. Police confirmed that Scott \"was involved in a disturbance/dispute with the crew\" of a charter boat at the Miami Beach Marina. Per the outlet, officers were called to the marina and Scott was asked to leave, but he returned and got into another dispute with the crew. He was asked to leave a second time, and when he refused, he was arrested. CNN reports that a $650 bond was posted for the artist on Thursday morning. Scott seemingly responded to his legal troubles in a post to Twitter/X on Thursday, writing simply, \"Lol\".\n\nNext week, Scott is set to embark on the European leg of his Circus Maximus Tour, his first tour since the Astroworld Festival tragedy. Last month, he made headlines for getting into a physical altercation with Alexander \"A.E.\" Edwards at a Cannes afterparty. According to a witness (for Entertainment Tonight), the party's host Richie Akiva announced Scott, rapper Tyga, and A.E. on stage: \"Right after that announcement, Travis immediately snatched the mic out of Richie's hand, and said, 'No, we're not doing this.' Alexander said, 'Let him show love.'\" The situation then escalated into a physical confrontation between Scott, A.E., and others. Per ET, \"Scott tried to push Edwards off the stage. Edwards, maintaining his balance, retaliated by dragging Scott across the stage and eventually throwing him off. The struggle continued with Edwards jumping on top of Scott, resulting in a scuffle captured on video.\"\n\nA.E. later told TMZ that he has \"no hard feelings\" towards Scott.

Apparently, the 43-year-old crooner missed a stop sign and couldn't manage to drive in a straight line. When police officers asked him to take a chemical test, he refused. The \"What Goes Around... Comes Around\" artist was hauled off to the police station for a glamour shot (read: mugshot) before being released.\n\nNot to be outdone by Timberlake's traffic travails, rapper Travis Scott decided to take things up a notch with his own brand of marina mayhem. Early on Thursday, July 20, the \"Sicko Mode\" rapper found himself in handcuffs after a chaotic night in Miami.\n\nAccording to police reports, the incident began when officers responded to a disturbance call at a marina in Miami. Upon arrival, they discovered Scott, whose real name is Jacques Bermon Webster, standing on a dock and yelling at occupants of a nearby vessel. Witnesses reported that the rapper appeared to be under the influence of alcohol and was causing a commotion.\n\nInitially, Scott complied with police commands to sit down, but his cooperation was short-lived. Despite the complainant expressing no desire to press charges and simply wanting the rapper to leave the premises, Scott continued his disruptive behavior. Officers noted a strong smell of alcohol emanating from the rapper's breath.\n\nIn an attempt to defuse the situation, Scott agreed to leave the dock after being threatened with arrest. However, his departure was far from quiet. As he walked towards the boardwalk, the rapper reportedly walked backward while yelling obscenities at the occupants of the vessel. Just when it seemed the situation had been resolved, Scott returned to the marina a mere five minutes later. He approached the sergeant he had previously spoken to and began yelling once again. His actions ultimately led to his arrest at approximately 1:17 am. Onlookers were surely surprised to see one of hip-hop's biggest stars causing such a scene.\n\nDuring questioning, Scott admitted to consuming alcohol, nonchalantly stating, \"It's Miami.\" As if that explanation alone could justify his unruly behavior.\n\nScott submitted a bond of $650 and was released from the correctional center that same morning. However, the timing of this incident could not be worse for the rapper, as he is set to embark on his European \"Circus Maximus\" tour just eight days post-arrest.

Will he able to perform in his upcoming tour?", "body": "The American singer has been arrested in Miami for disorderly intoxication and trespassing. He has been released and there will be no further charges. American singer Travis Scott has been arrested for disorderly intoxication and trespassing at the Miami Beach yacht. Describing his experience on social media, he just wrote 'lol'. He was charged on two counts of misdemeanor and booked at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Centre on Thursday at 4.35am local time. He was let off later after completing all the legal formalities. This has been reported by the Daily Mail. The singer has been accused of unruly conduct on board a yacht. It has been reported that the singer was involved in a fight on a yacht. This was a verbal altercation and not a physical one, according to various reports.\n\nWhen ten officers of the Miami Beach Marina boarded the yacht, they spotted Travis yelling at the other occupants. When the cops asked him to sit down, it has been reported that he disobeyed their orders. Further, cops found the singer to be stinking of alcohol and asked him to leave the dock or face arrest.\n\nJust when the singer was leaving the dock, he was spotted hurling abuses at the other occupants of the yacht. When he reached his vehicle, he is reported to have fought with his security personnel and asked them to stand back as he decided to drive. The police intervened at this stage and issued a strict warning to the singer. He reportedly left after this warning.\n\nThis was short lived as he came back on his car and continued hurling abuses at the occupants of the yacht. He was seen disturbing the peace of the area and causing nuisance before he was arrested by the police.\n\nHe was arrested by the police and booked at a correctional center. When questioned if he had been drinking alcohol, he replied in the affirmative. He was released after submitting a bond for $650 which included a bond for $500 for trespassing and $150 for the offense of disorderly intoxication. He will not be charged any further.\n\nDoes Travis Scott have any upcoming professional commitment?\n\nThe singer has an upcoming international Circus Maximus stadium tour in the Netherlands. This is on June 28.\n\nIs Travis Scott in a relationship?\n\nHe was in a relationship with Kylie Jenner. He has two children with Jenner. It has been reported that they had an on and off relationship since 2017 but are presently not together.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_intoxication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Substance intoxication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misdemeanor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misdemeanor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breach_of_the_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breach of the peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus Maximus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty_Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Specialty Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111146884,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-22068,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 2188, "textEnd": 2195}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Having snagged Teen Choice Awards and BET Hip Hop Awards, the rapper grew a sizable following as he continues to expand his stardom. While some claim that any sort of publicity is good, Scott recently found himself on the wrong side of the low when arrested Thursday morning in Miami.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThursday morning, at 4:35 a.m., police took Scott into custody and booked him at the nearby jail under charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct. Paying a bond of $650, the rapper walked away from the police only to tweet about his experience. Not giving too many details, Scott simply wrote \"LOL.\"\n\nGaining over 3 million views, fans rushed to the comment section to share pictures of Scott's mug shot with some slight changes. Other comments included, \"You good cuz. I got the bail for you.\" Another person added, \"Bro, you seen Justin Timberlake in there.\" And one comment read, \"The most valid reaction I've ever seen. LMAO.\"\n\nWhile details surrounding his arrest remain a mystery, a source revealed to ABC News no physical altercation took place. Instead, the rapper found himself at a party that got out of hand. The source said the arrest was \"akin to receiving a ticket.\"\n\n[RELATED: Travis Scott Extends World Tour in Europe and the UK in 2024]\n\nTravis Scott Prepares To Head To The Netherlands\n\nBesides dealing with law enforcement, Scott is currently preparing to start the European leg of his Circus Maximus Tour with performances in the Netherlands. The first show is scheduled for June 28. He will continue to tour the continent before heading to Brazil in September for the Rock in Rio music festival.\n\nFor fans of Scott, they know this wasn't his first altercation with the law as an arrest warrant was issued for him back in March 2023. At the time, rumors circulated that the star punched a sound engineer at Club Nebula. Not only did the rapper allegedly hit the worker but also caused over $12,000 in damages to sound equipment.\n\nUltimately reaching a settlement with the club, it seems that Scott once again has found himself with more legal troubles.\n\n(Photo by Rich Polk/Getty Images for Fanatics)", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_piner@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Chris Piner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET_Hip_Hop_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BET Hip Hop Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Choice_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teen Choice Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mug_shot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mug shot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Timberlake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disorderly conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settlement_(litigation)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Settlement (litigation)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Circus Maximus"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_in_Rio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock in Rio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Audio engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Awards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TS.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1682, "textEnd": 1689}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

My prayers go out to the families and all those impacted by what happened at Astroworld Festival,\" he tweeted at the time. \"Houston PD has my total support as they continue to look into the tragic loss of life.\"\n\nScott, who shares two children with ex Kylie Jenner, later claimed he didn't know the \"severity of the situation\" until the show was over.\n\n\"I just want to send out prayers to all the ones that was lost last night,\" he said in an Instagram Stories video. \"We're actually working right now [on] how to identify the families so we can help the system through this tough time ... We've been working closely with everyone to try to get to the bottom of this.\"\n\nDespite facing backlash, Scott maintained that he was unaware of the attendees' injuries because he couldn't see the entire crowd while performing on stage.\n\n\"And even at that moment, you're like, 'Wait, what?' People pass out, things happen at concerts, but something like that [is different],\" he told Charlamagne tha God in a December 2021 YouTube video. \"It's so crazy because I'm that artist too -- anytime you can hear something like that, you want to stop the show. You want to make sure fans get the proper attention they need. Anytime I could see anything like that, I did. I stopped it a couple times to just make sure everybody was OK. And I really just go off the fans' energy as a collective -- call and response. I just didn't hear that. You can only help what you can see and whatever you're told, whenever they tell you to stop, you stop.\"\n\nMore recently, Scott reflected on attempting to heal from the event, telling GQ in November 2023, \"That moment for families, for the city, you know, it was devastating. Making music, you think about things that go on in life and things that happen in your life, and you dial in on things.\"\n\nThe musician recalled feeling \"overly devastated\" in the aftermath. \"I always think about it. Those fans were like my family. You know, I love my fans to the utmost,\" he continued. \"You just feel for those people. And their families.\"\n\nScott turned to his music to help him work through his emotions. \"I got back into it probably, like, I don't know, months and months and months after,\" he detailed. \"And the idea of just even getting back into music, working on music and just even getting into that, was therapeutic of being able to channel some of the energy into production and sounds and finishing it.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Associated Press reported that nine out of 10 wrongful death lawsuits filed in the wake of the 2021 Astroworld Festival were settled. Terms of the settlements remained confidential.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yana_grebenyuk@usmagazine.com", "name": "Yana Grebenyuk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Travis Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astroworld_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Astroworld Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRG_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NRG Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTVJ", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WTVJ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turner Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlamagne_tha_God", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlamagne tha God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Jenner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylie Jenner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrongful_death_claim", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrongful death claim"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GQ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GQ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Concerts and Events", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work_and_Family", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work and Family", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Travis-Scott-Is-Arrested-for-Disorderly-Intoxication-and-Trespassing-on-Property-in-Miami.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667788", "eventUri": "eng-9667788", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 134, "textEnd": 141}], "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Years ago, he got arrested for \"inciting a riot\" at one of his shows. He was also recently investigated by police for his alleged role in the Astroworld Festival tragedy. Subsequently, he was cleared of any potential charges and is now awaiting class action lawsuits pertaining to those who were injured.

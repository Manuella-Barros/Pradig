This match is shaping up to be a must-watch, especially considering the unexpected journey Switzerland has had so far. The bookies are pricing Italy as the favourites in this tie but are still expecting Switzerland to somewhat threaten the Azzurri's defence of their European title. Italy surpassed the first major task of qualifying through the group of death largely helped by Croatia performing way below par and Albania surprising many despite results not going their way. Before the tournament kicked off, there was a lot of chatter about Switzerland likely bowing out during the group stages, something that hasn't happened since the 2010 World Cup. But Murat Yakin and his squad have defied the odds, securing a commendable second place in Group A, just behind Germany. Remarkably, they managed this without losing a single game. Remember Euro 2020? That was when Switzerland shocked everyone by knocking out France in the round of 16. Well, they're looking to work their magic once again and halt Italy's hopes of retaining their European Championship title. Italy, despite being the reigning champions of Europe, hasn't exactly been in top form this tournament. Under Luciano Spalletti\u2019s guidance, they barely scraped through Group B. It took a nail-biting goal from Mattia Zaccagni in the dying minutes of their last group match against Croatia to clinch a spot in the knockout stages.

Make sure your kids are not the last generation of Americans. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"\n\nCritics accused the actor of saying worse though.

Dreyfuss did get a raucous response from the crowd at the end of the discussion, though.\n\nThe Cabot sent out an email Sunday morning to ticket purchasers apologizing for Dreyfuss's comments. WBSM was provided a copy of the email from one of the attendees, signed by Executive Director J. Casey Soward, which reads:\n\n\"Dear Cabot Patrons,\n\nI am writing to address an important matter concerning last night's event with Richard Dreyfuss at The Cabot.\n\nWe deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.\n\nAt The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way.\n\nWe take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort it caused.\n\nWe are taking immediate steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again. This includes more rigorous vetting of our event participants and more proactive communication strategies to keep our audience informed.\n\nThank you for your understanding and continued support of The Cabot.\n\nWe value your feedback and are dedicated to learning from this experience to better serve our community.\"\n\nThe Cabot has a diverse lineup of programming, including events for Pride Month in June and a discussion event on May 28 titled \"How Discrimination Shows Up in Our Community and What We Can Do About It,\" moderated by Dr. Andre Morgan.\n\nDreyfuss has made controversial statements in the past, including a May 2023 appearance on the PBS series Firing Line, in which he blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science's new inclusion rules for the Academy Awards.\n\n\"They make me vomit,\" he said. \"Because this is an art form. It's also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it's an art,\" he said. \"And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\n\"What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? You can't legislate that. You have to let life be life and I'm sorry, I don't think there is a minority or majority in the country that has to be catered to like that.\"\n\nHe then went on to mention how Sir Laurence Olivier was the last white actor to play Othello, portraying the character in 1965 in blackface.\n\n\"He played a Black man brilliantly. Am I being told that I will never have a chance to play a Black man? Is someone else being told if they're not Jewish they should not be playing 'The Merchant of Venice?'\" he said. \"Are we crazy? Do we not know that art is art? This is so patronizing, so thoughtless and (it's) treating people like children.\"", "source": {"uri": "92moose.fm", "dataType": "news", "title": "92 Moose"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Merchant of Venice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Othello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Arts", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/518/files/2024/05/attachment-GettyImages-1482307902.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 361, "textEnd": 367}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 2937, "textEnd": 2943}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

In 2023, he appeared on the PBS series Firing Line with Margaret Hoover where he called out the Academy over its diversity and inclusion requirements for the Oscars.\n\n\"They make me vomit,\" the Mr. Holland's Opus actor said at the time. \"Because this is an art form. It's also a form of commerce, and it makes money. But it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\nHe went on to call the requirements \"patronizing\" and praised Laurence Olivier's 1965 portrayal of Othello, saying, \"He played a Black man brilliantly.\"\n\n\"What are we risking?\" Dreyfuss continued. \"Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? You can't legislate that, and you have to let life be life. And I'm sorry, I don't think that there is a minority or a majority in the country that has to be catered to like that.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bustle_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bustle (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Love Story (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thruxton_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thruxton Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_Line_(TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firing Line (TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Hoover", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margaret Hoover"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Othello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/vOilZcmXg7rZ97KEa9n_VqwDAnQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(750x328:752x330)/Richard-Dreyfuss-052724-e057d2fa099d4665aafe77ee4bbb6c26.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 340, "textEnd": 346}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 1628, "textEnd": 1634}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way.'\n\nDreyfuss, 78, was appearing at The Cabot in Beverly, Massachusetts, for a question and answer session followed by a screening of Jaws, the mega hit which launched his career in 1975\n\nDreyfuss pictured alongside his now-deceased Jaws co-stars Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw\n\nDreyfuss pictured with his wife, Russian-born Svetlana Erokhin in April 2023\n\n'We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort caused.'\n\nIn response to the controversy, one attendee, Rogue Mama, tweeted: 'Came here to see if Richard Dreyfuss had been cancelled tonight after appearing at #TheCabot in Beverly.'\n\nAnother person tweeted an alternative title for the evening: 'An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss. Disappointing doesn't even begin to cover it.'\n\nIronically, on May 28th, three days after Dreyfuss's appearance, the theater is hosting an event titled How Discrimination Shows Up in Our Community and What We Can Do About It.\n\nJust 12 months ago, Dreyfuss was widely criticized for his remarks on the new diversity and inclusion requirements at the Academy Awards and said 'they make me vomit.'\n\nDreyfuss made those remarks during an episode of PBS' Firing Line, which aired on Friday, and claimed the Academy was treating people like children by implementing the new criteria.\n\nThe actor also defended Laurence Olivier's performance in the 1965 film Othello in which he played the lead character in blackface.\n\nThe Cabot Cinema's management issued a full apology to customers who attended Dreyfuss's appearance\n\nHost Margaret Hoover asked Dreyfuss what he thought about the incoming inclusivity rules and he replied: 'They make me vomit.\n\n'No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings?\n\n'You can't legislate that.

The initiative, among other things, provides teachers with videos and educational tools.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Associated Press, calling for a 'civil strike' in support of the U.S. Constitution to encourage civic participation.\n\n'I'm going to send you a copy of the preamble to the Constitution,' he said. 'If there's anything in it that you don't agree with, don't sign it; just send me back an explanation. You will agree with everything, because it's beautifully crafted and it's meant for all.

Dreyfuss' words at the film screening -- billed as \"An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + 'Jaws' Screening\" at the Cabot -- resulted in some attendees walking out at the Beverly, Mass., theater.\n\nIn a YouTube video that appears to be from the event, Dreyfuss dances onto the stage wearing a dress over his button-up shirt while Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" plays. Two stagehands appear and remove the dress as Dreyfuss mimics a striptease before putting on a blazer and taking his seat ahead of the screening. It's unclear why the actor made such an entrance; representatives for Dreyfuss could not immediately be reached Monday by The Times.\n\nWhile footage of Dreyfuss' full remarks has yet to emerge, many took to social media to air their grievances with the 76-year-old actor. NBC 10 Boston reported that audience members said their tickets cost about $300 apiece. The news station also reported that one attendee was disgusted when Dreyfuss delivered \"a hate-filled speech that disparaged women in film, the #MeToo movement and LGBTQ rights.\" The actor also took aim at his \"Nuts\" producer Barbra Streisand, whom he called both a \"genius\" and an \"idiot,\" and shared \"bigoted opinions\" on transgender kids and their parents, the Hollywood Reporter and Deadline said. (Last May, the \"Goodbye Girl\" Oscar winner said that the Academy Awards' efforts to foster diversity \"make me want to vomit.\")\n\n\"He was there to speak about Jaws and his acting career. Nobody needs to hear him spewing filthy hate speech about the LGBTQ+ and transgender communities. He's more than welcome to his opinions, but hate speech has no place in a public forum,\" one Facebook user wrote on the Cabot's page.\n\n\"I'd be upset if I paid to see an event and thought he was doing a QandA about a beloved classic film and it turned into a rant about unrelated things - no matter what he was ranting about. Demented and entitled Boomer,\" another added.\n\n\"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic rant,\" another Facebook user wrote.\n\n\"This was disgusting,\" another attendee added, according to Deadline. \"How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better. Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap.\"\n\nDreyfuss, who has long advocated for better civics education, also referenced his 2022 book, \"One Thought Scares Me...,\" which focuses on having \"the right to make our opinions known\" and explains the damaging effects on society that a deteriorating civics education could cause.\n\nOnstage, Dreyfuss said, \"50 years ago, without telling anybody, they took civics out of the curriculum of all public schools in America, which means we have no knowledge of who the hell we are, and if we don't get it back soon, we're all gonna die,\" according to reports. \"Make sure that your kids are not the last generations of Americans, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"\n\nThe Cabot, which is located near where Steven Spielberg's blockbuster 1975 film was shot, apologized Tuesday for the actor's remarks and for not anticipating the potentially inflammatory nature of his appearance. However, when contacted by The Times, the theater did not provide a full account of what Dreyfuss said at the event.\n\n\"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film 'Jaws' at The Cabot,\" the venue's executive director J. Casey Soward said in a statement. \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\n\n\"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons,\" the statement continued.\n\nThe Cabot said that it is \"in active dialogue\" with its patrons about their experience and is committed to learning from this event \"how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating, and inspiring our community.\" The Cabot asked for privacy for its patrons.\n\nThe theater did not immediately respond to The Times' requests for further comment.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news",

The nattering nabobs on social media are trying to cancel Dreyfuss so The Cabot Theater in Beverly, Massachusetts issued an apology.\n\nDreyfuss dares to speak up about some issues with opinions that don't sit well with progressives.\n\nThe theater held an event billed as \"An Evening with Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening.\" The idea was for Dreyfuss to talk to the audience about the classic movie, in anticipation of amusing stories or insightful anecdotes about filming the movie.\n\nWhat happened was that Dreyfuss came on stage wearing a dress. He tore it off as he began to speak. Allegedly, he began to make sexist, homophobic, and transphobic remarks.\n\nIn what some people describe as a rant, the Oscar-winning actor went off the rails as he was speaking about Barbra Streisand. They were in a movie, Nuts, in 1987. He went into remarks about trans youth, gender-affirming treatment, and inclusivity rules for the Academy Awards. He's not a fan.\n\nOn Facebook one commenter claimed Dreyfuss said \"vile, dehumanizing, abhorrent things about trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, women, and survivors of sexual violence.\"\n\nOne attendee and X.com user named Rogue Mama wrote, \"Came here to see if Richard Dreyfuss had been canceled tonight after appearing at #TheCabot in Beverly.\" Another suggested an alternative title for the night's event: \"An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss. Disappointing doesn't even begin to cover it.\"\n\nOne person wrote in the comment section of the venue's latest Facebook post, \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundreds of others because of his racist homophobic misogynistic rant.\" Another person called Dreyfuss' comments \"disgusting\" and \"offensive.\"\n\nThere are no quotes from Dreyfuss used in a report by The Hollywood Reporter, just reactions on Facebook. That is sloppy reporting by an outlet that reports on the entertainment business.\n\nDeadline did a little bit better in its reporting.\n\nSocial media accounts of the event suggest that the trouble began when Dreyfuss started talking about his Nuts producer Barbra Streisand, calling her a \"genius\" but that women, in the commenter's account of the event, \"are so passive that's why the movie sucked.\" From there Dreyfuss apparently made disparaging remarks about the MeToo Movement, then \"started down the road of how you shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.\"\n\nSo, he criticized women, and people who let young kids make life-altering decisions about body mutilation, is that what we are to take away from the conversation?\n\nOne person on X said Dreyfuss called Streisand \"brilliant but an idiot\" and Steven Spielberg \"a genius but an idiot.\"\n\nThe theater should have known who they were inviting to speak. It also should have spoken up for him instead of apologizing for inviting him. Dreyfuss has a history of enjoying being provocative in his remarks. The problem is that he offends the delicate progressives when he says something they don't agree with.\n\nThe statement released by The Cabot was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nOn Monday, the venue apologized to attendees for Dreyfuss' remarks, writing in a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter: \"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\"\n\nWe regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.\n\nWe are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.\"\n\nWhat a bunch of weenies. Why were the theater leaders shocked that Dreyfuss made political remarks? He doesn't shy away from that. It would have been fine to talk in political terms if they were the correct political terms.\n\nI think if there was better reporting on quotes from the event, about half of America would agree with Dreyfuss. He also speaks out about the lack of civics being taught in schools. He wrote a book in support of bringing the subject back to schools. He's right. Students are being denied an important part of their education. They are ignorant of how government works, American history, and the importance of informed citizens in society. Progressives prefer to indoctrinate students in their ideology.\n\nIn 2008, he founded The Dreyfuss Initiative, a nonprofit that promotes teaching about American democracy in classrooms nationwide. Teachers are provided with videos and educational tools.\n\nDreyfuss appeared at a similar event on Friday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He was criticized by the audience there, too. He was described as sexist and mean.\n\nThe actor has been speaking out against the push for diversity and inclusion in Hollywood, specifically the Academy Awards. It isn't new. A year ago, in May 2023, he talked about the subject on PBS.\n\n\"They make me vomit,\" he said on Firing Line. \"No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? You can't legislate that. You have to let life be life and I'm sorry, I don't think there is a minority or majority in the country that has to be catered to like that. ... This is an art form. It's also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\nDreyfuss is a classic liberal. He isn't a crazy far-left progressive. The left used to be concerned about the Constitution and freedom of speech. No more. Now the left demands groupthink and anyone who veers from the script must be punished.\n\n\"We're so fragile that we can't have our feelings hurt,\" he said. \"We don't know how to stand up and bop the bully in the face.\" Dreyfuss is right. If an audience member is offended to the point of anger, they should just walk out. It's not the end of the world. Walking out in a dress may have been unconventional but it was his way of drawing attention to the transgender activism that dominates society today. He's 76 years old. I don't think he cares about criticism on social media. He shouldn't.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_townsend@hotair.com", "name": "Karen Townsend", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Hollywood Reporter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dehumanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutilation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutilation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Spielberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender rights movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Classical liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/128/8f55b076-a201-45ea-ba79-fe535c413826.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Dreyfuss starred as oceanographer Matt Hooper in the film.\n\nAfter the Saturday event, The Cabot sent an email to all of its patrons apologizing for the \"distressing and offensive\" remarks made by Dreyfuss that night.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot,\" the theatre wrote. \"At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way.\"\n\nThe email had some Cabot patrons who didn't attend the event scratching their heads. What did Dreyfuss say to cause such a reaction?\n\nThe event was not filmed, but short clips of Dreyfuss' entrance on stage and some of the comments he made were posted online. Audience members have also been sounding off on social media, with some slamming the actor for his remarks and others coming to his defence.\n\n\"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred (sic) of others because of his racist homophobic mysogynistic (sic) rant,\" one attendee wrote on The Cabot's Facebook page.\n\n\"I am absolutely horrified to learn about Dreyfuss's disgusting behavior tonight. His transphobic, homophobic, misogynistic rhetoric should have been shut down,\" a similar comment reads.\n\nAnother attendee said it was more like 20-25 people who walked out of the theatre, writing: \"It's a sad state of affairs where people are so emotional and sanctimonious that they can't even stay in the same room with someone they disagree with.\"\n\nVideo shows that Dreyfuss took to the stage wearing a floral dress while dancing to Taylor Swift's Love Story. Two stagehands then came out and unrobed him, revealing trousers and a dress shirt underneath.\n\nThe pre-screening Q&A between Dreyfuss and a moderator quickly \"went off the rails,\" according to one audience member: Dreyfuss was reportedly asked about his time working with Barbra Streisand on the 1987 film Nuts and spoke about how she \"is a genius but he didn't listen to her because she is a woman and women shouldn't have that power.\"\n\n(Streisand produced the movie, which starred both her and Dreyfuss.)\n\nAnother social media user claimed that Dreyfuss called Streisand \"stubborn to work with because she is a woman who should be submissive.\" The moderator then asked Dreyfuss about his views on the #MeToo movement, which he described as \"the people who make me vomit.\"\n\nMultiple attendees allege Dreyfuss started railing against transgender youth, specifically mentioning \"10-year-olds who want to change their gender.\"\n\nAudience member Diane Wolf told the Boston Globe that Dreyfuss said \"the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds.\"\n\nThroughout the rant, the crowd booed and heckled, according to witnesses, and many theatregoers got up and left.\n\nSarah Hogg told the Boston Globe that they paid US$300 for a ticket to the screening, which included a special meet-and-greet with the actor before the event. Hogg ended up leaving before the screening of Jaws even started because of Dreyfuss' comments.\n\n\"We were thrilled to see Richard Dreyfuss speak about his experience filming Jaws, what it was like, his time in Hollywood,\" Hogg said. \"That is not at all the experience that we got.\"\n\nHogg added that it was upsetting that they had shaken Dreyfuss' hand before the event and shared a nice conversation with him, only to then hear the actor say the things he did.\n\n\"I'm queer, I'm non-binary. This is personal to me,\" Hogg said. \"It's one of those moments where you feel like you're having an out-of-body experience. It was horrifying.\"\n\nA short video of the end of Dreyfuss' Q&A shows him plugging his 2022 book One Thought Scares Me, saying: \"Fifty years ago, without telling anybody, they took civics out of the curriculum at public schools in America. We have no knowledge of who the hell we are and if we don't get it back soon we're all gonna die. We have to make sure that your kids are not the last generation of Americans, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"\n\nWhat remained of the crowd at that point cheered and clapped for the actor.\n\nDreyfuss is no stranger to controversy stemming from comments he has made. Last year, the actor condemned the Academy Awards' announcement that entries for the Oscars will have to meet certain diversity and inclusion standards in an interview with PBS.\n\n\"No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is,\" he said.\n\nDreyfuss also praised Laurence Olivier's portrayal of Othello in 1965, saying he \"played a Black man brilliantly.\"", "source": {"uri": "globalnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Global News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_youth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender youth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oceanography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mass (liturgy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha's_Vineyard", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Martha's Vineyard"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Martha's Vineyard"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_(business)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diversity (business)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laurence Olivier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1482307902.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C3364px%2C1777px&resize=720%2C379", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

The same attendee also alleged Dreyfuss said: \"You shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.\"\n\nOther Cabot attendees took to the theatre's Facebook page to explain their reason for the walkout. \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred[s] of others because of his racist homophobic misogynistic rant,\" one social media user alleged, while another added: \"Richard Dreyfuss is an embarrassment to society.

According to one X user's paraphrasing, Dreyfuss said, \"that he didn't want to listen to 8 year olds saying that they were born in the wrong body.\" From all of the footage and the social media posts about the event, it is giving \"old man yells at cloud\" energy. Dreyfuss just seems furious that the world has moved on and he's not part of it.\n\nOne X user shared that their girlfriend's parents were at the event and reported back on what happened. \"Went off the rails talking about how Barbra Streisand is a genius but he didn't listen to her because she is a woman and women shouldn't have that power. Then started sharing his views on the me too movement and started down the road on how you shouldn't be listening to some 10 year old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl... Jesus Christ what an explosion. Crowd was shouting at him and most walked out before the movie even started. Talk about the movie asshole... We never made it to that. \"\n\nEveryone should have been clued into the weird event when Dreyfuss came out in a dress dancing to Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" and let the song go on for way too long.\n\nAnother video included Dreyfuss talking about his book, One Thought Scares Me... and he went on to say that 50 years ago they took civics out of our school curriculums. I don't know about you but I remember taking civics in high school!\n\nThings were so bad that people reportedly left and booed him in the venue. In the video featuring Dreyfuss talking about his book, there are people still cheering him on but it is not a loud crowd. The venue has since apologized for the event.\n\nThe Cabot issued an apology, obtained by The Hollywood Reporter: \"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\"\n\nThe apology goes on to state their original intentions with the night. \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons. We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.\"\n\nIn 2023, Dreyfuss was complaining and yelling about the Academy's new Inclusion Rules. \"They make me vomit,\" he said on Firing Line. \"No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? You can't legislate that. You have to let life be life and I'm sorry, I don't think there is a minority or majority in the country that has to be catered to like that. ... This is an art form. It's also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\nDreyfuss has always been hard to deal with.

I assumed he was horsing around, later a staff member told me he was walking around town for a couple of hours picking one out,' she said.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss was seen on video entering a screening and Q&A for his classic 1975 film Jaws wearing a dress before he was booed and faced walkouts from the Massachusetts crowd\n\nKerry said that the show then got back on the rails with Dreyfuss discussing his role in another Steven Spielberg classic, 1978's Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\n\nFrom there, however, Kerry said Dreyfuss went off, targeting his Nuts co-star Barbra Streisand. 'He began to say a lot of sexist things about her, about all women. Their stupid, they shouldn't have any power etc,' she continued.\n\nOther accounts say that Dreyfuss accused women of being 'passive' which is why the 1987 film Nuts 'sucked.'\n\n'Then he just kept going with homophobic and racist comments... He insulted the Me Too movement etc.'\n\nAnother member of the crowd said Dreyfuss said that society, 'Shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.'\n\nKerry said that the atmosphere in the theater quickly soured with many booing the star and some walking out. 'Now, now, don't turn into an angry mob,' Dreyfuss told the crowd, according to Kerry.\n\nKerry alleged that an employee of The Cabot told her that staff had been told to prepare for Dreyfuss's bizarre behavior as the night before a similar incident occurred at a similar event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n\nDreyfuss, 78, was appearing at The Cabot in Beverly, Massachusetts, for a question and answer session followed by a screening of Jaws, the mega hit which launched his career in 1975\n\nDreyfuss eventually put on a suit jacket and got rid of the dress but continued to offend many in the audience\n\nAn attendee of that show was quoted by Deadline as saying: 'I walked out tonight because of [Dreyfuss's] small minded bigoted view of women and choice.'\n\nAt one point during his Cabot show, Dreyfuss said: 'We're so fragile that we can't have our feelings hurt. We don't know how to stand up and bop the bully in the face.'\n\n'There is a time and place for that stuff, most likely a Republican rally, but not at a Jaws event.'\n\n'He's rich, entitled, he didn't care about anyone but himself last night... it was never a discussion, it was him being ignorant and inappropriate. I expected better.'\n\n'Someone should ask Steven Spielberg what he thinks about Dreyfuss saying these things at a showing of his movie,' Kerry added.\n\nThe attendee went on to say that she felt as though Dreyfuss was doing something for a book. 'I felt he was conducting a warped social experiment to prove some points in his book. That we can't disagree on things civilly etc. that's my opinion,' Kerry said.\n\nIn 2022, Dreyfuss published his book One Thought Scares Me...: We Teach Our Children What We Wish Them to Know; We Don't Teach Our Children What We Don't Wish Them to Know which dealt with the subject of the teaching civics in American schools .\n\nThe actor is passionate about the cause of civics education.\n\nIn 2008, he founded The Dreyfuss Initiative, a nonprofit that promotes teaching about American democracy in classrooms nationwide. The initiative, among other things, provides teachers with videos and educational tools.\n\nAccording to some audience members, Dreyfuss made disparaging remarks about Barbra Streisand, his co-star in the 1987 movie Nuts\n\nDreyfuss pictured alongside his now-deceased Jaws co-stars Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw\n\nDreyfuss pictured with his wife, Russian-born Svetlana Erokhin in April 2023\n\nIn a 2014 interview with The Associated Press, Dreyfuss called for a 'civil strike' in support of the U.S. Constitution to encourage civic participation.\n\nDreyfuss took an opportunity to plug his book at the conclusion of his Cabot appearance.\n\n'Fifty years ago without telling anybody they took civics out of the curriculum at public schools in America. We have no knowledge of who the hell we are and if we don't get it back soon we're all gonna die,' he said.\n\n'We have to make sure that your kids are not the last generation of Americans, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.'\n\nMeanwhile Dreyfuss's son, Ben Dreyfuss, a left-wing activist tweeted a joke in response to his father's antics.\n\n'Re: My father, well, now you know why I refused to give him the password to his own Twitter account for a decade lol.'\n\n'This will be my only statement on the matter.'\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Ben referred to the 'disgusting outrageous behavior of one of [his] relatives.'\n\nIt was earlier reported that Dreyfuss came on stage in a floral print dress, shaking his hips and swinging his cane like a baseball bat.\n\nThe Cabot Cinema's management issued a full apology to customers who attended Dreyfuss's appearance\n\nAfter the event, the theater issued an apology to all those who had bought tickets.\n\n'We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity we uphold at The Cabot,' the press release began.\n\nWe understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.'\n\n'At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way.'\n\n'We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort caused.'\n\nIn response to the controversy, one attendee, Rogue Mama, tweeted: 'Came here to see if Richard Dreyfuss had been cancelled tonight after appearing at #TheCabot in Beverly.'\n\nAnother person tweeted an alternative title for the evening: 'An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss.

Jesus Christ what an explosion.\"\n\n\"Crowd was shouting at him and most walked out before the movie even started. Talk about the movie a**hole...

Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap.\"\n\n\"We were thrilled to see Richard Dreyfuss speak about his experience filming 'Jaws,' what it was like, his time in Hollywood,\" one offended moviegoer told the Boston Globe. \"That is not at all the experience that we got.\"\n\n\"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.

Tickets cost up to $300.\n\nSome of those in attendance said the Oscar winner had made \"sexist and homophobic\" remarks, but other guests revealed the clothing stunt preceded Dreyfuss' criticism of parents of transgender children.\n\nDreyfuss took the stage in the blue floral-print dress and shook her hips to Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" while brandishing her cane like a baseball bat, attendees said.\n\n\"He said parents of trans youth allowing them to transition were bad parents and that one day these kids might change their minds,\" said Diane Wolf, one of the ticket holders.\n\nIn one of the clips posted online, Dreyfuss says of trans children: \"It's not right because when the child is 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus.'\n\nDreyfuss eventually put on a suit jacket and got rid of the dress, but continued to offend many in the audience.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter cites others who say he made disparaging remarks about Barbra Streisand, his co-star in the 1987 film Nuts.\n\nDreyfuss himself made no public comment on the event, while the theater which organized it apologized.\n\nHis son Ben Dreyfuss, journalist, spoke Monday evening on social networks.\n\n\"Re: my dad: well now you know why I refused to give him the password to his own Twitter account for a decade lol,\" Dreyfuss posted on X.\n\nAfter the event, the theater apologized to everyone who had purchased tickets.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not consistent with the values of inclusiveness that we uphold at Cabot,\" the press release begins.\n\nWe understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many members of our community, and for that, we sincerely apologize.\n\n\"At Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community.

He was horrible. Sexist, mean, arrogant. I went out like many others even before the screening of Jaws.

In video footage from the event, you can see the actor enter the theater to loud applause, wearing a blue maxidress over a blue oxford shirt, black pants, and brown baseball cap. He proceeds to showboat, to the audience's apparent delight -- pantomiming hitting a baseball with his cane -- before two women rush onstage and remove his dress. Dreyfuss then puts on a white blazer that has been laid out on his chair onstage, and continues to dance a bit before sitting down to begin the conversation.\n\nThe bizarre behavior reportedly went from quirky to alarming when Dreyfuss began his Q&A. According to one attendee, Dreyfuss went \"off the rails\" when discussing his Nuts producer Barbra Streisand, calling her a \"genius\" before adding that women, as a group, \"are so passive. That's why the movie sucked.\" According to the X user, Dreyfuss went on to discuss the #MeToo movement before he \"started down the road of how you shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.\"\n\n\"This was disgusting,\" wrote one attendee on the Cabot's Facebook page after the event, per Deadline. \"How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better.\" An X user named Rogue Mama also complained, posting, \"Came here to see if Richard Dreyfuss had been cancelled tonight after appearing at #TheCabot in Beverly.\"\n\nThe Cabot responded by issuing a lengthy apology to the attendees of the event, a statement obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. \"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.

We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.\n\nDreyfuss is no stranger to airing his opinions. Last year in an interview with PBS, he defended Laurence Olivier's performance in the 1965 film Othello, which stars Olivier in blackface. And in an exclusive interview with Vanity Fair, he disparaged the Broadway production of The Shark Is Broken, which detailed alleged tension on the set of Jaws between him and his costars. \"The problem is that they made my character the fool,\" said Dreyfuss. \"They didn't do that to Roy [Scheider], and they didn't do that to Robert [Shaw].

This is an art form. It's also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it's an art.\"\n\n\"No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\n\"What are we risking?

The venue issued an apology after the event, which it had billed as \"An evening with Richard Dreyfuss\" to accompany the movie screening.\n\nThe 76-year-old actor, who played a marine biologist in \"Jaws,\" walked onstage wearing a blue, floral-patterned dress that stage workers helped him remove before he put on a sport coat. A YouTube video of his entrance shows Dreyfuss perform a sort of improvised dance in the dress as he takes the stage, while the song \"Love Story\" by Taylor Swift plays in the background.\n\nDuring what was supposed to be a lighthearted question-and-answer session, some people in the audience walked out over his remarks about women in film and the #MeToo movement, transgender youths and LGBTQ+ rights, and the Academy Awards' efforts to foster inclusivity. Dreyfuss has previously said the academy's diversity efforts \"make me vomit.\"\n\nDreyfuss received applause when he ended the discussion by referencing his book, \"One Thought Scares Me...\" and his opinion that civics is no longer being taught in classrooms, to the country's detriment. The lack of a foundation in civics means \"we have no knowledge of who the hell we are,\" he is heard saying in another video shared online from that portion of the Q&A.\n\n\"And if we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die,\" Dreyfuss continued. \"Make sure your kids are not the last generation of Americans. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"\n\nThe Cabot sent an email apology in which it said it didn't endorse the opinions of the actor, who also starred in \"Close Encounters of The Third Kind,\" \"American Graffiti\" and \"The Goodbye Girl,\" a performance for which he received an Oscar. The venue's executive director didn't respond immediately to emails Tuesday, and a representative for Dreyfuss could not be reached.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize,\" The Cabot's statement said. CBS News contacted the venue for additional comments but did not receive an immediate reply.\n\nDreyfuss was subject to criticism around this time last year over his comments in an interview on the PBS program \"Firing Line with Margaret Hoover,\" where he discussed new inclusion initiatives for the Academy Awards. Initially announced in 2020 and implemented for the Oscars this year, the Academy said it was creating a set of eligibility standards for Best Picture contenders \"to encourage more equitable representation on and off screen.\"\n\n\"They make me vomit,\" Dreyfuss said when asked what he thought of the eligibility requirements. \"Because this is an art form. It's also a form of commerce, and it makes money. But it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is. And what are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? You can't legislate that.\"\n\n\"It's about the fact that 50 years ago, without telling anybody, they took civics out of the curriculum of all public schools in America, which means we have no knowledge of who the hell we are,\" Dreyfuss said of the work. \"And if we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die.

Casey Soward, said he \"shared\" attendees' concerns about Dreyfuss' comments.\n\n\"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic film has become a platform for political views,\" Soward wrote. \"We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and the discomfort it caused many customers.\"\n\nIn a Youtube video, Dreyfuss appears to come out on stage wearing a dress over her button-down shirt while a Taylor Swift song was playing. Then, two people ripped off the dress before Dreyfuss declared, \"this is the last time you'll see me in an LGBT costume,\" according to one viewer.\n\nThe same YouTube account published another video at the end of his speech, to the applause of the crowd.\n\n\"Fifty years ago, without telling anyone, they removed civics from the curriculum of every public school in America, which means we have no idea who we are, and if we don't get it back not soon, we'll be everyone's going to die,\" he said. \"Make sure your kids aren't the last generation of Americans, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"\n\nAccording to several social media posts, some audience members left the theater before the film as Dreyfuss made racist and homophobic remarks. One participant said in an email that he also made misogynistic comments about working with Barbara Streisand on their 1987 film \"Nuts,\" including calling her an \"idiot,\" according to one participant.\n\n\"So it turns out Richard Dreyfuss is BIG when it comes to hate,\" one participant said. wrote on Facebook. \"We lasted about 20 minutes before he started going after every group of marginalized people he didn't like.\"\n\nAnother participant said they went out, along with \"hundreds\" of other people. Another said about half the audience left after speaking out against transgender people and transgender children.\n\n\"Dreyfuss has spewed absolutely vile, dehumanizing and abhorrent things about trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, women and survivors of sexual violence,\" they wrote. \"I feel so much pain for all the young trans people in the audience listening to so much hate.\"\n\nLast week, Dreyfuss was in New Hampshire for a similar evening before a screening of \"Jaws\". The Music Hall in Portsmouth has sold tickets for up to $300 for a meet-and-greet with the \"Stand By Me\" actor. One attendee from New Hampshire called the conference \"horrible.\"\n\n\"Sexist, mean, arrogant,\" the participant wrote on Facebook. \"I went out like many others, even before the screening of Jaws.\"\n\nThe comments aren't out of character for the \"Close Encounters\" actor.

However, many were surprised by what Dreyfuss spoke about, leading to backlash and an apology from the theater.\n\nPer Variety, the screening took place at The Cabot Theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, on Saturday evening. Some attendees have said that Dreyfuss did an odd dance while wearing a dress before he then made disparaging remarks about transgender children and women in filmmaking, drawing accusations of transphobia and sexism. He's also said to have taken a shot at Jaws director Steven Spielberg. Details of what the actor allegedly said have been posted on social media, and while no clips of these rants have emerged, there is a video that's been posted that reveals when the actor danced in a dress.\n\nRelated What Went Wrong with the Jaws Franchise? Steven Spielberg's Jaws was a blockbuster success. However, its sequels slowly dropped in quality to the point of Universal abandoning the franchise.\n\nAllegedly, Dreyfuss commented on Nuts co-star Barbra Streisand by saying, \"She's brilliant but an idiot, you know women are so passive, that's why the movie sucked.\" He's also accused of having remarked about how people \"shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl,\" which is said to have prompted a fiery response from the crowd. Additionally, Dreyfuss is accused of taking a shot at Steven Spielberg, calling the director \"brilliant\" but an \"idiot,\" claiming that Close Encounters of the Third Kind only worked because Dreyfuss convinced Spielberg to hire him instead of Gene Hackman.\n\nThe Theater Has Offered an Apology\n\nThe Cabot Theater has since apologized for the controversy. An email was sent to attendees that stated that Dreyfuss' comments were \"not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect\" of the theater. The Cabot also took full responsibility for the situation, calling it an \"oversight\" that they hadn't anticipated the actor's appearance taking that direction. That could be a reference to Dreyfuss making offensive comments in the past on other sensitive issues like Blackface and Oscar diversity requirements.\n\nRelated Jaws' Biggest Changes From Book to Movie Jaws is one of the biggest summer blockbusters to be based on a book. But the movie had many changes made from the book before it was released.\n\nClose\n\n\"Dear Cabot Patrons,\" the apology letter reads. \"I am writing to address an important matter concerning last night's event with Richard Dreyfuss at The Cabot. We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.\"\n\nThe apology continues, \"At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort it caused. We are taking immediate steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again. This includes more rigorous vetting of our event participants and more proactive communication strategies to keep our audience informed.\"\n\nJaws is currently streaming for Starz

Casey Soward said in Monday's statement \"do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.\"\n\nVideo verified by NBC News shows Dreyfuss appearing on stage in a breakaway dress that is removed by stagehands to reveal the actor in slacks, a dress shirt and a jacket, and using a cane.\n\nThe Dreyfuss Initiative, an Encinitas, California, nonprofit dedicated to reinforcing civics education in the United States, did not immediately respond to emails and a phone call seeking comment on Monday, a holiday.\n\nThe sold-out event was billed as \"An evening with Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws screening.\" The theater is about 23 miles north of Boston. \"Jaws\" was set in Martha's Vinyard, Massachusetts, about 120 miles south of Beverly.\n\nAudience members interviewed by the Boston Globe said they paid $300 each for a ticket that included a meet-and-greet with Dreyfuss, but were appalled when he allegedly disparaged women in film, the MeToo movement, and LGBTQ rights. Sarah Hogg told the publication remarks on transgender children prompted them to walk out with their partner.\n\nIn the Cabot Theater's statement, Soward said the venue shares \"serious concerns ... following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss.\"\n\nHe continued: \"We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons. We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views.\"\n\nDreyfuss, 76, has been the source of controversial remarks in recent years, most notably his response to the Academy Awards' announcement last year that entries for the Oscars will have to meet certain diversity and inclusion standards.\n\n\"No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is,\" he told PBS' \"Firing Line With Margaret Hoover\" during an interview.\n\nThe purported remarks from Saturday drew both criticism and support. One audience member, saying she was echoing a comment on Facebook, characterized the event as \"An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss.\"\n\nBorn in New York City, raised in Beverly Hills, and based in San Diego County, the actor scored a breakout role in the 1973 film \"American Graffiti.\" But it was his portrayal of a marine biologist in the ultimate summer movie, \"Jaws,\" that made him a top-shelf performer in Hollywood.\n\nDreyfuss has used some of the credit he's earned on-screen to decry the state of education and politics in the United States and opine \"in favor of privacy, freedom of speech, democracy, and individual accountability,\" according to his initiative's website.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC

Talk about the movie a**hole.\"\n\nAnother person wrote on Facebook that they left the Q&A after 20 minutes. \"Should have been fun, but what a disappointment. Dreyfus is a pathetic clown and an intolerant jerk. Sad.\"\n\n\"This was disgusting,\" another attendee fumed on the venue's Facebook page. \"How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better. Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap.\"\n\nThe Cabot theatre later sent an email to those present at the screening, writing: \"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organisation. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\"\n\nAmid all this, another person on social media shared their own encounter with Dreyfuss from five years ago.\n\n\"Okay so we saw him do a pre-show talk in 2019 and holy s**t it went off the rails, too. He talked for at least 3 hours too long. It was WEIRD,\" they wrote, alongside a photo of them with the star.\n\nDreyfuss has been a prolific actor since the late 60s, winning an Academy Award for Best Actor in 1997 for his role in The Goodbye Girl.

The screening took place Saturday at The Cabot Theater in Beverly, which is a suburb of Boston.\n\nThe event, billed as \"An Evening with Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,\" was anticipated to feature behind-the-scenes stories from the making of the classicfilm. However, attendees were instead subjected to Dreyfuss' controversial views on topics including trans youth and the Academy Awards' inclusivity rules, The Hollywood Reporterreports.\n\nSocial media posts from attendees describe how Dreyfuss, who initially appeared on stage wearing a dress to the tune of Taylor Swift's \"Love Story,\" began his alleged rant while discussing Barbra Streisand.According toPeople, his remarks escalated from there, touching on various contentious issues.\n\nDreyfuss reportedly criticized trans youth and expressed disapproval of the Academy Awards' inclusivity requirements. He allegedly questioned the legitimacy of affirming trans kids' gender identity and shared his opposition to the rules meant to increase diversity and inclusion in the film industry.\n\nAccording to People, one attendee wrote on The Cabot's Facebook page, \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundreds of others because of his racist, homophobic, misogynistic rant.\" Another described the comments as \"disgusting\" and \"offensive.\"\n\nSarah Hogg and their partner, Jonah Hoffmann,told the Boston Globe that they walked out when Dreyfuss directed his comments at the parents oftransgender children. Hogg, who identifies as queer and nonbinary, said, \"It's one of those moments where you feel like you're having an out-of-body experience. It was horrifying.\"\n\nThe Cabot Theater issued an apology on Monday in response to the backlash. \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization,\" the establishment wrote. \"We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons. We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views.

Then, two people ripped the dress off before said Dreyfuss said \"that's the last time you'll see me in LGBT garb,\" according to one viewer.\n\nThe same YouTube account posted another video of the end of his talk, where the crowd cheered.\n\n\"50 years ago, without telling anybody, they took civics out of the curriculum of all public schools in America, which means we have no knowledge of who the hell we are, and if we don't get it back soon, we're all gonna die,\" he said. \"Make sure that your kids are not the last generations of Americans, and you know exactly what I'm talking about.\"\n\nAccording to multiple social media posts, some audience members walked out of the venue before the film as Dreyfuss made racist and homophobic remarks. One attendee said in an email that he also made misogynistic comments about working with Barbara Streisand on their 1987 movie \"Nuts\" that included calling her an \"idiot,\" according to an attendee.\n\n\"So, it turns out Richard Dreyfuss is BIG on hate,\" one attendee wrote on Facebook. \"We lasted about 20 minutes before he started going off about all the groups of marginalized people he didn't like.\"\n\nAnother attendee said they walked out, along with \"hundreds\" of others. Another said about half of the audience left after he ranted about transgender people and transgender children.\n\n\"Dreyfuss spewed absolutely vile, dehumanizing, abhorrent things about trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, women, and survivors of sexual violence,\" they wrote. \"I feel so much pain for any trans youth in the audience listening to so much hate.\"\n\nLast week, Dreyfuss was in New Hampshire for a similar evening before a screening of \"Jaws.\" The Music Hall in Portsmouth sold tickets for up to $300 for a meet-and-greet with the \"Stand By Me\" actor. One attendee in New Hampshire called the talk \"awful.\"\n\n\"Sexist, mean, arrogant,\" the attendee wrote on Facebook. \"I walked out as did many others even before the Jaws screening.\"\n\nThe comments aren't out of character for the \"Close Encounters\" actor. Dreyfuss went on PBS's Firing Line last year and defended Laurence Olivier's 1965 performance of \"Othello,\" where he wore blackface to play the titular character.\n\n\"He played a Black man brilliantly,\" he said. \"Am I being told that I will never have a chance to play a Black man? Is someone else being told that if they're not Jewish, they shouldn't play the Merchant of Venice? Are we crazy?\"\n\nDreyfuss also said diversity standards for the Academy Awards make him \"vomit.\"\n\nIn their statement, the Cabot said Dreyfuss's views don't reflect their values of inclusivity.\n\n\"We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons,\" Soward wrote.", "source": {"uri": "boston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "molly_farrar@boston.com", "name": "Molly Farrar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_by_Me_(Ben_E._King_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stand by Me (Ben E.

But it's a free country. People are allowed to have different opinions about stuff.\"\n\nDuring an event billed as \"An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,\" the actor made several remarks that perplexed and offended many in the audience, including comments seemingly intended to belittle Barbra Streisand, the MeToo movement, and LGBTQ rights.\n\nAt one point, talking about trans rights, Dreyfuss said, \"It's not OK because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus.'\" That angered many in the audience, who responded by shouting at the actor. Others registered their displeasure by walking out.\n\n\"That was the comment that sparked the first wave of walkouts,\" said Casey Soward, executive director of the Cabot. \"He got booed and then said, 'Oh, it's gonna be one of those kinds of crowds' or something like that.\"\n\nDreyfuss, whose credits include \"American Graffiti,\" \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind,\" \"Mr. Holland's Opus,\" and \"The Goodbye Girl,\" for which he won the best actor Oscar in 1978, has made provocative statements in recent years.\n\nLast year, in an interview on PBS, Dreyfuss criticized the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for creating new diversity and inclusion standards. \"No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is,\" the actor said. \"What are we risking? Are we really risking hurting people's feelings? You can't legislate that.\"\n\nAt The Cabot, Dreyfuss warned that many young people in the US don't understand how government works, and he called for more civics education in American schools. \"If we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die,\" Dreyfuss said. \"Make sure your kids are not the last generation of Americans. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.\" (In 2006, the actor founded the The Dreyfuss Civics Initiative, whose mission is to revive civics education.)\n\nSoward said staff at The Cabot encountered several patrons who were \"really distraught\" by Dreyfuss's behavior and comments.\n\n\"Sometimes people go to see a comedian who has these views and it's well known. They're kind of opting in for that experience,\" he said. \"But in this case, people thought they were going to see a screening of a movie and maybe hear some anecdotes from the movie.\"\n\nAs soon as people started walking out, Soward said he began crafting an apology, which was then emailed to all ticket holders. (The event was sold out -- the capacity of the Cabot is 850 -- and Soward estimated that 125 people left before the movie started.)\n\n\"At the Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way,\" the statement reads. \"We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort it caused.\"\n\nIt turns out Dreyfuss had also upset patrons at a similar event at The Music Hall in Portsmouth the night before. Seth Fiermonti, an engineer who attended the special \"Jaws\" screening with his wife, described Dreyfuss as somewhat \"incoherent\" and also \"extremely arrogant\" for deriding Streisand, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino.\n\nAfter a man in the audience yelled, \"We love you!,\" Fiermonti said Dreyfuss responded: \"You love me? Do I love you? Are you gay?\" When the man yelled again, according Fiermonti, Dreyfuss leaned forward and said, \"Don't be gay.\"\n\nAs Fiermonti and his wife were walking out, he said a worker at the Music Hall apologized and gave them free movie tickets.\n\nSoward said \"Jaws,\" which is coming up on its 50th anniversary, will be screened at The Cabot again sometime, but Dreyfuss won't be invited.\n\n\"Been there, done that,\" he said. \"There were a number of his fans who stayed and appreciated this event, but I think it'll be different next time.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Cabot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Civics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goodbye_Girl_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Goodbye Girl (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_(business)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diversity (business)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Pacino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets_For_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Tickets For Shows", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/5lCVG8YsfSwnER6XrxowRYFnFhk=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/CBCU7VITQ7BBWEKRFNTJRITKRI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Attendees anticipated an evening filled with behind-the-scenes insights from the iconic film. However, according to reports by Deadline, they were instead subjected to Dreyfuss's opinions on trans youth and the Academy Awards' inclusivity rules.\n\nAlthough no official transcript of the event has surfaced, social media posts indicate that Dreyfuss's controversial comments began while discussing Barbra Streisand and escalated thereafter. Notably, Dreyfuss made his entrance wearing a dress to Taylor Swift's \"Love Story,\" which set the tone for the unexpected turn of events.\n\nOne attendee expressed their discontent on The Cabot's Facebook page, stating, \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundreds of others because of his racist, homophobic, misogynistic rant.\"\n\nIn response to the backlash, The Cabot issued a statement on Monday, May 27, apologizing to those who attended. \"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot,\" the statement read. \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\"\n\nThe statement further acknowledged the unexpected shift in the event's tone, saying, \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.\"\n\nThe statement concluded by reaffirming the venue's commitment to its audience: \"We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.\"\n\nThe incident has sparked widespread discussion and raised questions about the responsibilities of public figures during live events.\n\nLast update on 2024-05-28 / Affiliate links / Images from Amazon Product Advertising API", "source": {"uri": "socialitelife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Socialite Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cabot", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Cabot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love Story (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affiliate_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affiliate marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://socialitelife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/richard-dreyfuss-06-23-2022-the-los-angeles-premie-scaled.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 288, "textEnd": 294}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 1196, "textEnd": 1202}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

But it's a free country. People are allowed to have different opinions about stuff,' journalist Ben Dreyfuss, 37, wrote on X on Tuesday.\n\nDreyfuss, who played a marine biologist in the movie, walked onstage wearing a blue, floral-patterned dress that stage workers helped him remove before he put on a sport coat.\n\nDuring what was supposed to be a lighthearted question-and-answer session, some people in the audience walked out over his remarks about women in film and the #MeToo movement, transgender youths and LGBTQ+ rights, and the Academy Awards' efforts to foster inclusivity.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss, who played a marine biologist in the movie Jaws, walked onstage wearing a blue, floral-patterned dress\n\nHis son Ben son Ben defended him after a his rant at a $300-a-head screening of his legendary movie Jaws\n\nHis son Ben, one of the co-founders of progressive magazine Mother Jones, had previously laughed off the controversy.\n\n'Wow, just looked at my phone and learned about the disgusting outrageous behavior of one of my relatives,' he said on X, adding a screenshot of a relative telling him they had an Android instead of an iPhone.\n\nHe followed up: 'Re: My father, well, now you know why I refused to give him the password to his own Twitter account for a decade lol.'\n\nAn attendee at the question and answer session in Massachusetts over Memorial Day weekend told DailyMail.Com the Oscar-winner 'kept going' with homophobic and racist comments during his appearance.\n\n'He started the night coming out with a dress on dancing to Taylor Swift saying that this was LGBTQ moment.

'He began to say a lot of sexist things about her, about all women. Their stupid, they shouldn't have any power etc,' she continued.\n\nOther accounts say that Dreyfuss accused women of being 'passive' which is why the 1987 film Nuts 'sucked.'\n\nAnother member of the crowd said Dreyfuss said that society, 'Shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.'\n\nKerry said that the atmosphere in the theater quickly soured with many booing the star and some walking out. 'Now, now, don't turn into an angry mob,' Dreyfuss told the crowd, according to Kerry.\n\nDespite the walkouts, Dreyfuss received applause when he ended the discussion by referencing his book, 'One Thought Scares Me...' and his opinion that civics is no longer being taught in classrooms, to the country's detriment.\n\nDreyfuss pictured alongside his now-deceased Jaws co-stars Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw\n\nAccording to some audience members, Dreyfuss made disparaging remarks about Barbra Streisand, his co-star in the 1987 movie Nuts\n\nThe Cabot Cinema's management issued a full apology to customers who attended Dreyfuss's appearance\n\nThe lack of a foundation in civics means 'we have no knowledge of who the hell we are,' he said.\n\n'If we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die.'\n\nThe Cabot sent an email apology in which it said it didn't endorse the opinions of the actor, who also starred in Close Encounters of The Third Kind, American Graffiti and The Goodbye Girl, a performance for which he received an Oscar.\n\nThe venue's executive director didn't respond immediately to emails Tuesday, and a representative for Dreyfuss could not be reached.\n\n'We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot.

Most of them probably expected the moderator to lead Dreyfuss on an overview of his amazing career, allowing him to discuss not only Jaws (and set the record straight about whether or not he was a jerk on set) but also films like American Graffiti, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Stand by Me, Stakeout, What About Bob?, or the two that earned him recognition from the Academy: Mr. Holland's Opus (he earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance in the film) and The Goodbye Girl (he won the Best Actor Oscar for that one). Instead, Dreyfuss used the event as an opportunity to go on a free-form rant that led to a lot of audience members to walking out on him, shocked and offended by the things he was saying.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Dreyfuss's rant was partly a continuation of what he had to say last year when he bashed the Academy's inclusion rules. Things got off to a confusing start when Dreyfuss took the stage in a dress, dancing to a Taylor Swift song. After being helped out of his dress, he sat down for the interview and after \"speaking about Barbra Streisand\" he \"moved into his bigoted perspective on trans youth, the Academy Awards' inclusion rules, and then on to trans kids affirming their gender.\" As one person in attendance described it, \"An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss. Disappointing doesn't even begin to cover it.\" Another said they \"walked out of his interview along with hundred of others because of his racist homophobic misogynistic rant.\"\n\nDreyfuss ended the Q&A by talking about his book One Thought Scares Me...

Now, at a screening this week, he allegedly used his platform to make comments against the transgender community.\n\nDreyfuss starred in many successful movies in the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. Most notably, he played marine biologist Matt Hooper in the 1975 Steven Spielberg film Jaws. He also had roles in Close Encounters of the Third Kind, American Graffiti, and more.\n\nHowever, his reputation is under threat by some of his recent public comments. In 2023, Dreyfuss took hits at the Academy Awards' new diversity guidelines, which require films to meet at least two of four diversity benchmarks, including that the lead actors are from underrepresented groups or that at least 30 per cent of the cast and crew come from these groups. He claimed the new rules \"make me vomit\", adding, \"no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give into the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\nDreyfuss also spoke about the history of Blackface in performance, complaining, \"Am I being told that I will never have a chance to play a Black man?\" Of the decision to rid Hollywood of the problematic racial performance, he said, \"This is so patronizing. It's so thoughtless and treating people like children.\"\n\nHis latest comments came at a Jaws retrospective screening at The Cabot theatre where he took digs at trans rights, the Me Too movement and seemingly, women in general. One attending told the Boston Globe that \"[Dreyfuss] said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds.\"\n\nAnother attendee commented on a Facebook post regarding the comments, stating they were \"vile, dehumanizing, abhorrent things about trans youth, LGBTQ+ people, women and survivors of sexual violence.\"\n\nIn response to the comments, Cabot executive director J. Casey Soward issued an apology, claiming he didn't know Dreyfuss would say what he did. \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views,\" he wrote in a statement, adding, \"We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused to many patrons.\"\n\nThe Cabot also emailed ticket holders with a further apology. They wrote, \"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.\"\n\nDreyfuss is yet to comment on the alleged incident.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucy_harbron@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Lucy Harbron", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blackface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Close Encounters of the Third Kind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Spielberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dehumanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parenting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2023/06/Richard-Dreyfuss-American-Actor-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

But, nope, Richard Dreyfuss truly went full a**hole for an audience that just wanted to know about the robot shark.\n\nAccording to The Boston Globe, the Q&A with Dreyfuss went immediately off the rails as he started ranting about LGBTQ kids, women, and the #MeToo movement. Turns out Mr. Holland's Opus is in the key of hate:\n\n\"He said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds,\" said Diane Wolf, of Salem, who was in the audience. She said Monday that the event is all she's been able to think about since Saturday.\n\nIn one comment that was captured on video, Dreyfuss said, \"It's not okay because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus.' \" The crowd can be heard shouting at him.\n\nDreyfuss also had a lot of pepper in the tank for the #MeToo movement, and if you're wondering if that's because Dreyfuss was one of the male actors accused of preying on women, you bet! Most people probably forgot about those accusations or completely missed them, but they're sure hearing about them now.\n\nA Twitter user claimed her girlfriend's parents were at the Dreyfuss event and provided a rundown of his meltdown, which reportedly included insulting both Barbra Streisand and Steven Spielberg for having too much power for a woman and being an idiot, respectively.\n\nShortly after the event, The Cabot Theater sent out the following email (via Variety) where it apologized for Dreyfuss's remarks and planned to do a better job vetting its future guests. The actor has yet to comment on the debacle, but when he does, I'm sure it'll be real dumb.\n\nDear Cabot Patrons,\n\nI am writing to address an important matter concerning last night's event with Richard Dreyfuss at The Cabot.\n\nWe deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.\n\nAt The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community.

It was so bad that the venue had to apologize.\n\nDreyfuss, who starred in Jaws as Matt Hooper, came out on stage with a cane and dress. Deadline reports that attendees at The Cabot noted that he was being homophobic, transphobic, and sexist during his time in the limelight.\n\nThis all happened on Saturday night, on what was supposed to be an exciting evening for fans of Jaws and the actor. Before the classic Steven Spielberg movie was screened, there was a Q&A. And that's when things become unhinged.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss's wild rant at Jaws screening\n\nThe actor came out on the stage and oddly wielded his cane like a baseball bat. According to social media accounts from people there, he started talking about his Nuts director, Barbara Streisand. First, he called her a \"genius,\" but women \"are so passive that's why the movie sucked.\"\n\nIt was then that he started laying into the MeToo Movement and also discussing how you shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.\n\nOne commenter on Cabot's Facebook page said, \"I am absolutely horrified to learn about Dreyfuss's disgusting behavior tonight. His transphobic, homophobic, misogynistic rhetoric should have been shut down.\"\n\nSomeone else stated, \"Yo that was bonkers! I was wondering why someone of his caliber, and age, would bother with a tour of small theaters. I believe I see the agenda now.\"\n\n\"Crowd was shouting at him and most walked out before the movie even started,\" another comment says. \"Talk about the movie asshole.\"\n\nA statement of apology from the Cabot to attendees wrote, \"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused many of our patrons.\"\n\nIt continued, \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views. We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort it caused many patrons. We are in active dialogue with our patrons about their experience and are committed to learning from this event how to better enact our mission of entertaining, educating and inspiring our community.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Dreyfuss has caused an uproar. In fact, a Friday night screening of Jaws at The Music Hall in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he apparently made anti-gay remarks, according to a commenter. Also, on PBS's Firing Line, the actor stated that the diversity efforts of The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences \"make me vomit.\"\n\nWe could be wrong, but we're guessing Richard Dreyfuss won't be invited back to The Cabot anytime soon.

At one time, I could quote the movie verbatim. Singing the praises of \"Jaws\" is another column for another time.\n\nOver the weekend, Richard Dreyfuss hosted \"An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening\" at the Cabot Theater in Beverly, Mass. According to some reports, it did not go over well with all of the attendees. Deadline notes that Dreyfuss took the stage wearing a dress, wiggling his hips, and brandishing his cane like a baseball bat. And the crowd went wild.\n\nAccording to Breitbart, Dreyfuss was asked to make a few remarks prior to the screening. The actor took the opportunity to speak out against the trend toward inclusivity in the Academy Awards and transgenderism -- in particular, the practice of transitioning children. He also criticized Barbra Streisand.\n\nVarious sources said that some members of the audience began booing Dreyfuss while others left the theater before the movie began. Those who catcalled and stormed out accused the actor of being misogynistic, racist, and homophobic. You know the drill. The Cabot Theater even went so far as to issue an apology:\n\nWe are aware of and share serious concerns. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\n\nThe theater is also in \"active dialogue\" with its patrons and is committed to learning from the event. That, of course, is the only acceptable response the theater could give. Heaven forfend it stand up for Dreyfuss' First Amendment rights.\n\nThat being said, more than a few people received Dreyfuss' comments well, as is evidenced by this video at the end of the Q&A:\n\nThe audio is not the best, so here is a transcript. Dreyfuss is speaking about his new book, \"One Thought Scares Me...: We Teach Our Children What We Wish Them to Know; We Don't Teach Our Children What We Don't Wish Them to Know.\"\n\nIt's about the fact that 50 years ago, without telling anybody, they took civics out of the curriculum of all public schools in America, which means we have no knowledge of who the hell we are. And if we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die. Make sure your kids are not the last generation of Americans. And you know exactly what I'm talking about.\n\nHad Dreyfuss used the opportunity to take potshots at Trump and conservatives and laud all the traditional left-wing causes, no one would have stormed out, jeered, or scurried off to their social media accounts to throw the requisite tantrums.\n\nMost people would dub Dreyfuss a classical liberal. He started The Dreyfuss Civics Initiative, which is an organization that spreads awareness about basic civics, the Constitution, and the things that make America great. It also advocates for greater education in those areas.\n\nFrom the website:\n\nThe United States of America was one of the first political bodies that gave its subjects distinct individual freedoms, which are outlined in the Bill of Rights. Built from the ideas of the Enlightenment, America was constructed as a nation dependent on the sovereignty of the people, a breakthrough in a world full of monarchies and tyrannies. Our political system emphasizes the power of the individual by granting citizens the distinctive ability to be part of a sovereign body that elects representatives and impacts policies.\n\nNone of those thoughts are music to a progressive's ears.

Talk about the movie... we never made it to that.'\n\nThey added: 'Steven Spielberg is a genius but an idiot and close encounters only worked because he convinced Spielberg to hire him instead of Gene Hackman for the part.'\n\nIn the Instagram comments for The Cabot, Oliver said: 'He was rightfully met with boos and people walking out.'\n\nIn the r/Jaws subreddit, user ConstructionPitiful9 shared: 'From what i remember he touched on being anti trans and letting kids transition, then was asked what he thought on me too and said it made him throw up.\n\n'I will say though, I thought it was strange the interviewer was egging him on and kept asking questions of the nature for a bit instead of shutting it down.'\n\nThe statement from the Cabot Theatre read: 'Dear Cabot Patrons, I am writing to address an important matter concerning last night's event with Richard Dreyfuss at The Cabot.\n\n'We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize.\n\n'At The Cabot, we are committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members of our community. The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect our beliefs, and we do not endorse them in any way.\n\n'We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for any discomfort it caused. We are taking immediate steps to ensure that such an incident does not happen again.\n\n'This includes more rigorous vetting of our event participants and more proactive communication strategies to keep our audience informed.'\n\nThis is not the first time Dreyfuss has said something controversial as he told PBS's Firing Line host Margaret Hoover inclusivity rules at the Oscars 'make [him] vomit'.\n\nDreyfuss went on: 'No one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.'\n\nHe then praised Laurence Olivier as 'the last white actor to play Othello', stating: 'He did it in 1965. And he did it in blackface. And he played a black man brilliantly.'\n\nIn 2020 he hit out at MeToo, saying he did not welcome it 'at the cost of the loss of due process'.\n\n'Unfortunately, it became immediately equating an accusation being heard as a verdict,' Dreyfuss claimed.\n\n'Women have been abused by men for millennia, but it's not something that's going to be solved by committing an equal or worse crime, which is kicking process into the ocean.'\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to reps for Dreyfuss and The Cabot for comment.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page -

The Boston Globe reports that he continued by saying that allowing such young people to transition \"was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds.\"\n\nHowever, a video from the end of the event indicates that many audience members did remain and were highly appreciative of the actor, who cautioned against a decline in critical thinking to considerable applause.\n\nWriting on The Cabot's Facebook page, one attender said: \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundred [sic] of others because of his racist homophobic misogynistic rant.\"\n\nSaid another: \"This was disgusting. How could the Cabot not have vetted his act better.

He told PBS: \"they make me vomit, because this is an art form\".\n\n\"It's also a form of commerce,\" he continued, \"and it makes money. But it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\nThe requirements, he went on to say, were \"patronising\", and he cited Laurence Olivier's 1965 Othello, saying: \"He played a Black man brilliantly.\"\n\n\"What are we risking?\" Dreyfuss continued. \"Are we really risking hurting people's feelings?

Suddenly, the artist began to make controversial and \"offensive\" comments.\n\nHe ranted over issues involving trans people, the LGTBIQ+ collective in general, the Me Too movement, women and even the singer and actress Barbra Streisand. His comments unsurprisingly went viral on social media.\n\nAccording to Diane Wolfe of the Boston Globe, the actor stated: \"Allowing parents of trans youth to transition was bad parenting. Someday those kids might change their minds.\"\n\nMany people responded on X, with one saying: \"An evening of misogyny and homophobia with Richard Dreyfuss.

Dreyfuss has previously said the academy's diversity efforts \"make me want to vomit.\"\n\nDreyfuss received applause when he ended the discussion by referencing his book, \"One Thought Scares Me...\" and his opinion that civics is no longer being taught in classrooms, to the country's detriment. The lack of a foundation in civics means \"we have no knowledge of who the hell we are,\" he said. \"If we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die.\"\n\nThe Cabot sent an email apology in which it said it didn't endorse the opinions of the actor, who also starred in \"Close Encounters of The Third Kind,\" \"American Graffiti\" and \"The Goodbye Girl,\" a performance for which he received an Oscar.

The actor, who plays Hooper in the shark thriller Jaws is not new to negative headlines, especially with his political, sociocultural views, and aversion to modern-day \"standards of morality\" or the Oscars' diversity requirements.\n\nRichard attended a screening of the Steven Spielberg-directed film at The Cabot Theatre, in Beverly, Massachusetts on Saturday. While appearing in the Q&A session, the Hollywood legend went on a rant, which left many attendees reeking with anger, to the point of walking out mid-way through the interview. But what exactly did Richard Dreyfuss say?\n\nThe full content of the interview capturing Richard Dreyfuss' comments is yet to surface. However, those who witnessed the moment have deemed it \"disgusting,\" \"misogynistic\" \"racist,\" and \"homophobic.\" Additionally, Richard reportedly made \"abhorrent\" remarks demeaning women and survivors of sexual violence. The icon began on a hearty note though, thrilling the audience with a dress performance of Taylor Swift's Love Story. As the interview progressed, the 76-year-old went into various sensitive topics, spanning the #MeToo movement, trans youths and Barbara Streisand.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss reportedly made comments opposing his select topics, ultimately making a light-hearted Q&A session about the thriller Jaws, into a scandalous political rant. While the interview is yet to go public, some attendees at the Saturday event have taken to social media to vent their outrage.\n\nAlthough some of these outraged theatregoers have directed their grievance at the Jaws actor, others have targeted The Cabot for giving him an audience despite knowing his history of spewing hateful comments. Cheri Ziegra, who witnessed the rant wrote on Facebook,\n\n\"This was disgusting. How could The Cabot not have vetted his act better? Apparently (I found out too late), he has a reputation for spewing this kind of racist, homophobic, misogynistic bullcrap. ...

This was offensive and we demand a refund.\"\n\nAnother attendee wrote,\n\n\"A young family with a 10-year-old daughter had to leave,\" recounted another commenter. Dozens of patrons reportedly walked out of the venue.\"\n\nA third Facebook user also expressed their grievance, writing,\n\n\"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundreds of others because of his racist, homophobic (and) misogynistic rant.\"\n\nAmid the incessant criticism of The Cabot for offering Richard Dreyfuss a platform to spew racist and anti-LGBTQ comments, the performing arts center offered a public apology. In his statement, Cabot executive director J. Casey Soward apologized for not foreseeing Richard Dreyfuss' tendency to say provocative things. He also expressed regret that an event meant to celebrate an iconic movie \"became a platform for political views.\" Mr. Soward voiced the cinema's willingness to take \"full responsibility\" and utilize the Memorial Day weekend event as a learning experience. He shared,\n\n\"We take full responsibility for the oversight in not anticipating the direction of the conversation and for the discomfort, it caused to many patrons.\"\n\nThe Cabot also reached out to attendees via personal emails, apologizing for the \"distressing\" and \"offensive\" comments Richard Dreyfuss made. They reassured patrons of their intentions to take immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Given Richard's outspokenness and history of airing misguided political views, expecting reconciliatory efforts on his part would be too much to ask.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judith_ike@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Judith Ike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thriller (genre)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performing_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Performing arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Race-Ethnic-Religious Relations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Satire", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Satire", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Richard-Dreyfuss-interview.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Directors like Steven Soderbergh and Kevin Smith do it frequently; friends of mine spoke fondly about attending a showing of Die Hard in which Alan Rickman shared some of his memories of working on the film. So you'd think that attending a screening of Jaws with an appearance by Richard Dreyfuss would offer insight into one of the most beloved summer movies of all time.\n\nInstead, the event seems to have abounded with offensive comments by the featured actor - and an apology from the theater in their aftermath.\n\nThe event took place on Saturday at the Beverly, Massachusetts theater The Cabot. As recounted by The Hollywood Reporter's Kevin Dolak and Carly Thomas, Dreyfuss's comments at the event prompted reports of walkouts at the event and a backlash to the actor's comments on social media. By Monday, the theater itself had issued a statement distancing itself from Dreyfuss.\n\n\"We are aware of, and share serious concerns, following the recent event with Richard Dreyfuss prior to a screening of the film Jaws at The Cabot,\" the theater stated. \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\"\n\nAccording to reports on social media, Dreyfuss's comments included insults directed at Barbra Streisand, transgender kids and women. \"It went pear shaped really quickly,\" wrote one Twitter/X user who was in attendance.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter also shared that a similar event in New Hampshire also found Dreyfuss inveighing about politics, to the chagrin of much of the audience.

{"uri": "8150203514", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-28", "time": "16:43:25", "dateTime": "2024-05-28T16:43:25Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-28T16:41:41Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7137255072593689, "url": "https://ca.news.yahoo.com/diversity-rules-vomit-richard-dreyfuss-163350873.html", "title": "'Diversity rules make me vomit': Richard Dreyfuss's history of controversy", "body": "Most Oscar-winning actors in their mid-70s might expect a quietly rewarding autumnal period in their lives and careers. Some acclaimed character acting work; perhaps an autobiography or two; and the warm acclaim of their peers, as well as the contented knowledge that they will be remembered as amongst the finest stars of their generation.\n\nWhatever Richard Dreyfuss is after, however, it certainly isn't this kind of regard. Instead, the man seems drawn to controversy like a moth to a flame; everywhere he goes, there is some new outrage, some incendiary incident that appalls everyone he comes into contact with. The man is a self-described \"manic depressive\" - he prefers the term to 'bipolar' - and the consequences can be unpredictable, to say the least.\n\nThe most recent demonstration of Dreyfuss's extraordinary ability to upset people came on May 25, when he appeared as a special guest at the Cabot theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts. The $300-a-ticket evening was described as \"An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening\", and most might reasonably have expected some good-natured reminiscence and anecdotes about his time working with Spielberg and the late Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw - to say nothing of the mechanical shark.\n\nInstead, Dreyfuss, who arrived on stage wearing a dress to the accompaniment of Taylor Swift's Love Story, proceeded to rant about everything and everyone from Barbra Streisand (\"she's a genius but I don't listen to her because she's a woman and women shouldn't have that power\") to his views on diversity and the MeToo movement. For good measure, he called Spielberg \"a genius but an idiot\" and announced that Close Encounters of the Third Kind only worked because he persuaded the director to hire him, rather than Gene Hackman, for the lead role.\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of this went down well. Amidst widespread discontent from the audience, one wit came up with an alternative title for the evening - \"An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss\". The Cabot was obliged to make a statement in which they apologised wholeheartedly: \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views.\"\n\nHad this been a one-off, then Dreyfuss - whose struggles with mental health and drug addiction have been well-documented - might have been expected to come forward, issue a grovelling apology and, perhaps, return, penitent, to the Cabot to give the audience what they had expected. This seems unlikely; it subsequently transpired that Dreyfuss had behaved in a similarly \"sexist and mean\" fashion the previous evening at a similar event at a cinema in New Hampshire.\n\nYet anyone booking Dreyfuss for any kind of public talk must be aware of the inevitable reputational risks that they run when dealing with such a loose cannon. One friend of mine, who was responsible for organising high-profile speaker events, singled out Dreyfuss as the last person on earth who he would book, citing both his unpredictability and the actor's likelihood to give serious offence. Here are some of the many, many reasons why Dreyfuss occupies such a curious place in public life - and, perhaps not coincidentally, why he has been a low-key presence in cinema for the past decades.\n\nThe early years of Dreyfuss's career now seem like an almost Faustian bargain for the young actor. After a brief appearance in The Graduate, he played the lead in George Lucas's American Graffiti, had the excellent supporting role of the oceanographer Hooper in Jaws and reunited with Spielberg two years later to star in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. All three films were massive hits and enabled him to appear in the $100 million-grossing romantic comedy The Goodbye Girl in 1977, for which he won an Oscar for Best Actor. Aged 30, he was then the youngest man to do so.\n\nWith the world at his feet, Dreyfuss enthusiastically plunged headlong into the gutter. As he later said, \"[I was] more than a bit silly. I became the worst kind of person... I was doing a play in LA and I had a revelation: if I had no secrets, no one could hurt me. I became a lying, low-down, dirty dog.\" Perhaps inspired by the scene in Close Encounters in which his character Roy Neary makes a tower out of mashed potato, Dreyfuss eschewed the opportunity to take the excellent roles that he could have been offered, and instead coasted by on the kudos that his Oscar had given him for a couple of years, while burying himself in mountains of cocaine.\n\nThis came to an artistic head in 1980, when he was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for Worst Actor for his performance in the musical drama The Competition: it was not a success. He now claims to have no record of shooting the follow-up picture, 1981's Whose Life Is It Anyway?, given how strung out he was on drugs at the time.\n\nDreyfuss has been married three times - his current spouse, Svetlana Erokhin, is someone who he has been with since 2006 - and has spoken candidly about his desires to right wrongs with people who he has offended in the past. He suggested that, after he attained sobriety, \"I realised I had hurt every woman I loved\", and wrote to them to apologise and ask for forgiveness, only for such absolution not to be forthcoming. As he said: \"That was harsh. But I revised my life goal and that included being a good person.\" Given many of his recent remarks about Streisand, with whom he co-starred in the 1987 psychological drama Nuts, this would seem to be a stretch.\n\nIt also resonated poorly with the writer Jessica Teich, who recounted many of her unpleasant and demeaning experiences working with a supposedly sober Dreyfuss in the Eighties, which included his exposing his erect penis to her in a 1987 incident and making her feel \"sexualised, objectified and unsafe\", to say nothing of his sending her love notes and telling her \"I want to f___ you.\" When Dreyfuss was asked for comment on these incidents in 2017, he answered that \"I emphatically deny ever \"exposing\" myself to Jessica Teich, whom I have considered a friend for 30 years. I did flirt with her, and I remember trying to kiss Jessica as part of what I thought was a consensual seduction ritual that went on and on for many years. I am horrified and bewildered to discover that it wasn't consensual.\"\n\n\"I respect that he's trying to grapple with it, and I regret that he's not being totally honest,\" Teich replied. \"Sadly, what I regret even more is I'll never forget the sight of his penis because I was so surprised to see it there.\"\n\nDreyfuss once said \"I am a wonderful actor, and I know it.\" The Oscar - and a subsequent nomination for his acclaimed performance in the 1995 musical drama Mr Holland's Opus - may be proof of this, but he has found it far harder to get along with his fellow actors. He described Bill Murray, who he appeared with in the 1991 comedy What About Bob?, as an \"Irish drunken bully\" and had a particularly contentious relationship with his Jaws co-star Robert Shaw, who believed that Dreyfuss was \"a young punk with no stage experience\" and needed \"a real slapping down\", something that he expressed by telling the younger actor to \"mind his mannerisms.\"\n\nDreyfuss, exasperated by Shaw's heavy drinking on set, knocked his co-star's bourbon glass out of his hand before filming one day, to which Shaw later responded by pointing a fire extinguisher at Dreyfuss's face while off camera, subsequently soaking him with it when the scene finished.\n\nAlthough Dreyfuss apparently came to venerate the late actor, calling him \"the kindest, gentlest, funniest guy you ever met\" in 2010, this may not have been wholly accurate. Shaw's son Ian, who co-wrote an acclaimed play about the production of Jaws and its underlying tensions, The Shark is Broken, described how, when he met Dreyfuss to seek his blessing before the show premiered in Edinburgh in 2019, the encounter went badly. \"He looked as if he'd seen a ghost, you know, a bad ghost,\" Shaw said. In 2023, Dreyfuss finally had his own say, telling Vanity Fair that watching the play was \"pretty awful....they just decided to make my character a big jerk.\" Even though he had happily posed for pictures with the cast at the Broadway premiere, he claimed that it was inaccurate, saying that the arguments he had with Shaw were only \"playful ribbing\", rather than the existential disagreements portrayed on stage.\n\nThe Mel Brooks musical adaptation of The Producers was a vast hit on Broadway, and when the time came for the London transfer, Dreyfuss was cast opposite Lee Evans, in the lead role of the conniving impresario Max Bialystock. All appeared to be going smoothly, until Dreyfuss appeared on Frank Skinner's chat show in October 2004, and announced to the audience \"The Producers opens November 9. Come from Christmas on. Do not come before that, OK?\"\n\nUnfortunately, Dreyfuss soon discovered that, for the physically demanding role of Bialystock, you had to be \"half actor, half athlete\" to make a success of it, and it soon became clear that, as he put it, \"At a very late date, I wondered too if my body couldn't do it. Really, my body divorced itself from me in July.\" He left the role 'by mutual consent' shortly after his interview with Skinner, and the original star Nathan Lane replaced him at a few days' notice, subsequently winning an Olivier award for his performance. Dreyfuss wryly complained that, had he lasted the course, \"You know, I would have won every award in Britain.\"\n\nHe later made his British stage debut at the Old Vic, under the artistic directorship of Kevin Spacey, in the 2009 play Complicit. Unfortunately, the now-forgotten political drama attracted far greater interest firstly for the fact that Dreyfuss, unable or unwilling to remember his lines, wore a prominent earpiece through which his dialogue was fed on stage, and secondly for his teenage son Harry later alleging that he was groped by Spacey while his oblivious father was rehearsing his lines in front of him. (At the time, Spacey's lawyer said that the actor \"absolutely denies the allegations\".) Given the embarrassment that he underwent for his inability to remember these lines, the whole affair might have been better left alone.\n\nAlthough Dreyfuss has worked with Spielberg three times - most recently on the all but forgotten supernatural 1989 firefighting drama Always - he has had less luck with other collaborators. When he worked with Oliver Stone on the 2008 political drama W., in which he played Dick Cheney, Dreyfuss helpfully rubbished the film and the filmmaker on the promotional circuit, saying \"You can be a fascist even when you're on the left\" and, when asked why he took on the role of Cheney, he replied \"Money\".\n\nStone, meanwhile - a man who has famously put casts of his through rigorous shoots - described working with Dreyfuss as \"probably the single worst experience I've ever had with an actor in my life\", and, after Dreyfuss was unable to remember his lines, said \"You're going to read these [expletive] cue cards, and if you don't read them, this scene is over\".\n\nYears later, Dreyfuss seemed to find the contretemps amusing, saying \"Oliver and I were at loggerheads about that and we still are. He screamed that I was the worst actor he's ever worked with. I'd held up the production and so on.\" However, Dreyfuss had what he thought was the last laugh. \"I told him he had made one strategic error: the press junket is yet to come. I told the press exactly what I told [him].\"\n\nDreyfuss has, to date, written two books; a 1996 thriller, The Two Georges, and 2022's One Thought Scares Me...: We Teach Our Children What We Wish Them to Know; We Don't Teach Our Children What We Don't Wish Them to Know. In the latter, he made a forceful argument that civics should be more widely taught in American schools, and that the failure to do so risked jeopardising a generation's education.\n\nMany might have sympathy with this as an argument, but since the book's publication, Dreyfuss, who seems no longer to care about maintaining a career as an actor, has been vocal about everything from the Academy's new diversity and inclusion issues (\"They make me vomit...no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is\"), to the blackface backlash (\"so patronising...so thoughtless...it's treating people like children\").\n\nContinuing the culture wars theme, on Saturday he declared that parents of transitioning kids are irresponsible , and that someday these children might change their minds. Quite what this has to do with Jaws is anyone's guess.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to attendees, the 76-year-old actor made several controversial comments that were perceived as homophobic.\n\nThe event, held at The Cabot Theater in Beverly, Massachusetts, featured a $300-a-head screening of \"Jaws,\" the 1975 blockbuster that catapulted Mr. Dreyfuss to fame. During his appearance, Mr. Dreyfuss also criticized the MeToo movement, liberal transgender ideology, and his former co-star Barbra Streisand.\n\nOne attendee, identified only as Kerry, tells the Daily Mail that she attended the event with her sister, who had given her the tickets as a birthday present. Kerry described Mr. Dreyfuss's entrance, where he appeared on stage wearing a dress and dancing to a Taylor Swift song, calling it an \"LGBTQ moment.\"\n\nInitially, the event seemed to proceed smoothly, with Mr. Dreyfuss discussing his role in the 1977 Steven Spielberg film \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind.\" However, Kerry noted that the actor soon deviated from the discussion, making disparaging remarks about Streisand and women in general.\n\nOther attendees confirmed that Mr. Dreyfuss accused women of being \"passive,\" which he claimed was the reason the 1987 film \"Nuts,\" in which he co-starred with Ms. Streisand, was unsuccessful.\n\nMr. Dreyfuss's comments did not stop there. He continued with statements that many found homophobic, including criticism of the MeToo movement. Another attendee recalled Mr. Dreyfuss saying that society, \"shouldn't be listening to some 10-year-old who says they want to be a boy instead of a girl.\"\n\nOn Monday, the theater apologized to attendees of the event.\n\n\"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.

Then there's a video at the end where he talks about his book that's about the importance of teaching civics to kids to help preserve the America we know.

Dreyfuss has previously said the academy's diversity efforts \"make me want to vomit.\"\n\nDreyfuss received applause when he ended the discussion by referencing his book, \"One Thought Scares Me...\" and his opinion that civics is no longer being taught in classrooms, to the country's detriment. The lack of a foundation in civics means \"we have no knowledge of who the hell we are,\" he said. \"If we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die.\"\n\nThe Cabot sent an email apology in which it said it didn't endorse the opinions of the actor, who also starred in \"Close Encounters of The Third Kind,\" \"American Graffiti\" and \"The Goodbye Girl,\" a performance for which he received an Oscar. The venue's executive director didn't respond immediately to emails Tuesday, and a representative for Dreyfuss could not be reached.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize,\" The Cabot's statement said.\n\nMore from this section\n\nBill Walton, Hall of Fame player who became a star broadcaster, dies of cancer at 71\n\nClosing arguments, jury instructions and maybe a verdict?

{"uri": "8150198932", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-05-28", "time": "16:39:41", "dateTime": "2024-05-28T16:39:41Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-05-28T16:38:15Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.6784313917160034, "url": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/richard-dreyfuss-most-controversial-quotes/", "title": "'Diversity rules make me vomit': Richard Dreyfuss's history of controversy", "body": "Before offending Jaws fans in a dress, the 'sexist and mean' Oscar winner had turned saying - and doing - the wrong thing into a fine art\n\nMost Oscar-winning actors in their mid-70s might expect a quietly rewarding autumnal period in their lives and careers. Some acclaimed character acting work; perhaps an autobiography or two; and the warm acclaim of their peers, as well as the contented knowledge that they will be remembered as amongst the finest stars of their generation.\n\nWhatever Richard Dreyfuss is after, however, it certainly isn't this kind of regard. Instead, the man seems drawn to controversy like a moth to a flame; everywhere he goes, there is some new outrage, some incendiary incident that appalls everyone he comes into contact with. The man is a self-described \"manic depressive\" - he prefers the term to 'bipolar' - and the consequences can be unpredictable, to say the least.\n\nThe most recent demonstration of Dreyfuss's extraordinary ability to upset people came on May 25, when he appeared as a special guest at the Cabot theatre in Beverly, Massachusetts. The $300-a-ticket evening was described as \"An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening\", and most might reasonably have expected some good-natured reminiscence and anecdotes about his time working with Spielberg and the late Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw - to say nothing of the mechanical shark.\n\nInstead, Dreyfuss, who arrived on stage wearing a dress to the accompaniment of Taylor Swift's Love Story, proceeded to rant about everything and everyone from Barbra Streisand (\"she's a genius but I don't listen to her because she's a woman and women shouldn't have that power\") to his views on diversity and the MeToo movement. For good measure, he called Spielberg \"a genius but an idiot\" and announced that Close Encounters of the Third Kind only worked because he persuaded the director to hire him, rather than Gene Hackman, for the lead role.\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of this went down well. Amidst widespread discontent from the audience, one wit came up with an alternative title for the evening - \"An Evening of Misogyny and Homophobia With Richard Dreyfuss\". The Cabot was obliged to make a statement in which they apologised wholeheartedly: \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views.\"\n\nHad this been a one-off, then Dreyfuss - whose struggles with mental health and drug addiction have been well-documented - might have been expected to come forward, issue a grovelling apology and, perhaps, return, penitent, to the Cabot to give the audience what they had expected. This seems unlikely; it subsequently transpired that Dreyfuss had behaved in a similarly \"sexist and mean\" fashion the previous evening at a similar event at a cinema in New Hampshire.\n\nYet anyone booking Dreyfuss for any kind of public talk must be aware of the inevitable reputational risks that they run when dealing with such a loose cannon. One friend of mine, who was responsible for organising high-profile speaker events, singled out Dreyfuss as the last person on earth who he would book, citing both his unpredictability and the actor's likelihood to give serious offence. Here are some of the many, many reasons why Dreyfuss occupies such a curious place in public life - and, perhaps not coincidentally, why he has been a low-key presence in cinema for the past decades.\n\n'I became a lying, low-down, dirty dog'\n\nThe early years of Dreyfuss's career now seem like an almost Faustian bargain for the young actor. After a brief appearance in The Graduate, he played the lead in George Lucas's American Graffiti, had the excellent supporting role of the oceanographer Hooper in Jaws and reunited with Spielberg two years later to star in Close Encounters of the Third Kind. All three films were massive hits and enabled him to appear in the $100 million-grossing romantic comedy The Goodbye Girl in 1977, for which he won an Oscar for Best Actor. Aged 30, he was then the youngest man to do so.\n\nWith the world at his feet, Dreyfuss enthusiastically plunged headlong into the gutter. As he later said, \"[I was] more than a bit silly. I became the worst kind of person... I was doing a play in LA and I had a revelation: if I had no secrets, no one could hurt me. I became a lying, low-down, dirty dog.\" Perhaps inspired by the scene in Close Encounters in which his character Roy Neary makes a tower out of mashed potato, Dreyfuss eschewed the opportunity to take the excellent roles that he could have been offered, and instead coasted by on the kudos that his Oscar had given him for a couple of years, while burying himself in mountains of cocaine.\n\nThis came to an artistic head in 1980, when he was nominated for a Golden Raspberry for Worst Actor for his performance in the musical drama The Competition: it was not a success. He now claims to have no record of shooting the follow-up picture, 1981's Whose Life Is It Anyway?, given how strung out he was on drugs at the time.\n\n'I had hurt every woman I loved'\n\nDreyfuss has been married three times - his current spouse, Svetlana Erokhin, is someone who he has been with since 2006 - and has spoken candidly about his desires to right wrongs with people who he has offended in the past. He suggested that, after he attained sobriety, \"I realised I had hurt every woman I loved\", and wrote to them to apologise and ask for forgiveness, only for such absolution not to be forthcoming. As he said: \"That was harsh. But I revised my life goal and that included being a good person.\" Given many of his recent remarks about Streisand, with whom he co-starred in the 1987 psychological drama Nuts, this would seem to be a stretch.\n\nIt also resonated poorly with the writer Jessica Teich, who recounted many of her unpleasant and demeaning experiences working with a supposedly sober Dreyfuss in the Eighties, which included his exposing his erect penis to her in a 1987 incident and making her feel \"sexualised, objectified and unsafe\", to say nothing of his sending her love notes and telling her \"I want to f___ you.\" When Dreyfuss was asked for comment on these incidents in 2017, he answered that \"I emphatically deny ever \"exposing\" myself to Jessica Teich, whom I have considered a friend for 30 years. I did flirt with her, and I remember trying to kiss Jessica as part of what I thought was a consensual seduction ritual that went on and on for many years. I am horrified and bewildered to discover that it wasn't consensual.\"\n\n\"I respect that he's trying to grapple with it, and I regret that he's not being totally honest,\" Teich replied. \"Sadly, what I regret even more is I'll never forget the sight of his penis because I was so surprised to see it there.\"\n\n'Bill Murray? An Irish drunken bully'\n\nDreyfuss once said \"I am a wonderful actor, and I know it.\" The Oscar - and a subsequent nomination for his acclaimed performance in the 1995 musical drama Mr Holland's Opus - may be proof of this, but he has found it far harder to get along with his fellow actors. He described Bill Murray, who he appeared with in the 1991 comedy What About Bob?, as an \"Irish drunken bully\" and had a particularly contentious relationship with his Jaws co-star Robert Shaw, who believed that Dreyfuss was \"a young punk with no stage experience\" and needed \"a real slapping down\", something that he expressed by telling the younger actor to \"mind his mannerisms.\"\n\nDreyfuss, exasperated by Shaw's heavy drinking on set, knocked his co-star's bourbon glass out of his hand before filming one day, to which Shaw later responded by pointing a fire extinguisher at Dreyfuss's face while off camera, subsequently soaking him with it when the scene finished.\n\nAlthough Dreyfuss apparently came to venerate the late actor, calling him \"the kindest, gentlest, funniest guy you ever met\" in 2010, this may not have been wholly accurate. Shaw's son Ian, who co-wrote an acclaimed play about the production of Jaws and its underlying tensions, The Shark is Broken, described how, when he met Dreyfuss to seek his blessing before the show premiered in Edinburgh in 2019, the encounter went badly. \"He looked as if he'd seen a ghost, you know, a bad ghost,\" Shaw said. In 2023, Dreyfuss finally had his own say, telling Vanity Fair that watching the play was \"pretty awful....they just decided to make my character a big jerk.\" Even though he had happily posed for pictures with the cast at the Broadway premiere, he claimed that it was inaccurate, saying that the arguments he had with Shaw were only \"playful ribbing\", rather than the existential disagreements portrayed on stage.\n\n'At a very late date, I wondered too if my body couldn't do it'\n\nThe Mel Brooks musical adaptation of The Producers was a vast hit on Broadway, and when the time came for the London transfer, Dreyfuss was cast opposite Lee Evans, in the lead role of the conniving impresario Max Bialystock. All appeared to be going smoothly, until Dreyfuss appeared on Frank Skinner's chat show in October 2004, and announced to the audience \"The Producers opens November 9. Come from Christmas on. Do not come before that, OK?\"\n\nUnfortunately, Dreyfuss soon discovered that, for the physically demanding role of Bialystock, you had to be \"half actor, half athlete\" to make a success of it, and it soon became clear that, as he put it, \"At a very late date, I wondered too if my body couldn't do it. Really, my body divorced itself from me in July.\" He left the role 'by mutual consent' shortly after his interview with Skinner, and the original star Nathan Lane replaced him at a few days' notice, subsequently winning an Olivier award for his performance. Dreyfuss wryly complained that, had he lasted the course, \"You know, I would have won every award in Britain.\"\n\nHe later made his British stage debut at the Old Vic, under the artistic directorship of Kevin Spacey, in the 2009 play Complicit. Unfortunately, the now-forgotten political drama attracted far greater interest firstly for the fact that Dreyfuss, unable or unwilling to remember his lines, wore a prominent earpiece through which his dialogue was fed on stage, and secondly for his teenage son Harry later alleging that he was groped by Spacey while his oblivious father was rehearsing his lines in front of him. (At the time, Spacey's lawyer said that the actor \"absolutely denies the allegations\".) Given the embarrassment that he underwent for his inability to remember these lines, the whole affair might have been better left alone.\n\n'You can be a fascist even when you're on the left'\n\nAlthough Dreyfuss has worked with Spielberg three times - most recently on the all but forgotten supernatural 1989 firefighting drama Always - he has had less luck with other collaborators. When he worked with Oliver Stone on the 2008 political drama W., in which he played Dick Cheney, Dreyfuss helpfully rubbished the film and the filmmaker on the promotional circuit, saying \"You can be a fascist even when you're on the left\" and, when asked why he took on the role of Cheney, he replied \"Money\".\n\nStone, meanwhile - a man who has famously put casts of his through rigorous shoots - described working with Dreyfuss as \"probably the single worst experience I've ever had with an actor in my life\", and, after Dreyfuss was unable to remember his lines, said \"You're going to read these [expletive] cue cards, and if you don't read them, this scene is over\".\n\nYears later, Dreyfuss seemed to find the contretemps amusing, saying \"Oliver and I were at loggerheads about that and we still are. He screamed that I was the worst actor he's ever worked with. I'd held up the production and so on.\" However, Dreyfuss had what he thought was the last laugh. \"I told him he had made one strategic error: the press junket is yet to come. I told the press exactly what I told [him].\"\n\n'Diversity rules? They make me vomit'\n\nDreyfuss has, to date, written two books; a 1996 thriller, The Two Georges, and 2022's One Thought Scares Me...: We Teach Our Children What We Wish Them to Know; We Don't Teach Our Children What We Don't Wish Them to Know. In the latter, he made a forceful argument that civics should be more widely taught in American schools, and that the failure to do so risked jeopardising a generation's education.\n\nMany might have sympathy with this as an argument, but since the book's publication, Dreyfuss, who seems no longer to care about maintaining a career as an actor, has been vocal about everything from the Academy's new diversity and inclusion issues (\"They make me vomit...no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is\"), to the blackface backlash (\"so patronising...so thoughtless...it's treating people like children\").\n\nContinuing the culture wars theme, on Saturday he declared that parents of transitioning kids are irresponsible , and that someday these children might change their minds. Quite what this has to do with Jaws is anyone's guess.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_larman@telegraph.co.uk",

The event left many in the audience feeling rattled after watching a beloved actor spew hateful remarks that prompted many to walk out, while others wished they had.\n\nIn a video from the event, Dreyfuss walked onto the stage to a Taylor Swift song while wearing a dress, which was then torn off prior to his talk by a few helpers. At first, Hogg said, Dreyfuss's misogynistic remarks, in which they recall him saying women were submissive and weak, sounded like they could be ironic -- more of a commentary about how Hollywood has traditionally viewed women.\n\n\"Then it just got so quickly off the rails,\" Hogg said, recalling comments about hating the MeToo and LGBTQ movements.\n\nWhen the remarks turned to transgender kids, Hogg and Hoffman walked out, along with many others.\n\n\"He said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds,\" said Diane Wolfe, of Salem, who was in the audience. She said Monday that the event is all she's been able to think about since Saturday.\n\nIn one comment that was captured on video, Dreyfuss said, \"it's not okay because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus.'\" The crowd can be heard shouting at him.\n\nDreyfuss's representative did not respond to a request for a comment.\n\nJ. Casey Soward, executive director for The Cabot, said in an emailed statement that the theater is aware of -- and shares serious concerns about -- Dreyfuss' comments at the event, which he said do not \"reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.\"\n\nHe also expressed regret about failing to anticipate that the talk could go in that direction.\n\nIn recent years, Dreyfuss has made other, similar remarks. In an episode of PBS' Firing Line last year, he said the Film Academy's rules about inclusivity, \"make me want to vomit.\" He went on to say, \"no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"\n\nLooking back, Hogg said it's upsetting to think about having shaken Dreyfuss's hand before the event and shared a nice conversation about how much Jaws meant to Hoffman, only to have Dreyfuss then go on stage and say the things he did.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_and_submission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominance and submission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salem, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salem, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_Line_(TV_program)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firing Line (TV program)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Octopus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/LuR7cxcgqCfmr3PXg-gENyQQg4c=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/YAN2NVFPUUI6HHD7YKCZ63CCO4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

And if we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die. Make sure your kids are not the last generation of Americans. And you know exactly what I'm talking about,\" he said.\n\nThe Cabot later issued an apology for Richard's \"distressing\" remarks.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at the Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offense to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize,\" executive director J.

(AP) -- The actor Richard Dreyfuss showed up in a dress at a \"Jaws\"-themed event in Massachusetts, where the blockbuster 1975 movie he starred in was shot, and then proceeded to make demeaning remarks about women, LGBTQ+ people and diversity.\n\nThe venue, The Cabot in the community of Beverly, issued an apology after Saturday's event.\n\nThe 76-year-old actor, who played a marine biologist in the movie, walked onstage wearing a blue, floral-patterned dress that stage workers helped him remove before he put on a sport coat.\n\nDuring what was supposed to be a lighthearted question-and-answer session, some people in the audience walked out over his remarks about women in film and the #MeToo movement, transgender youths and LGBTQ+ rights, and the Academy Awards' efforts to foster inclusivity. Dreyfuss has previously said the academy's diversity efforts \"make me want to vomit.\"\n\nDreyfuss received applause when he ended the discussion by referencing his book, \"One Thought Scares Me...\" and his opinion that civics is no longer being taught in classrooms, to the country's detriment. The lack of a foundation in civics means \"we have no knowledge of who the hell we are,\" he said. \"If we don't get it back soon, we're all going to die.\"\n\nThe Cabot sent an email apology in which it said it didn't endorse the opinions of the actor, who also starred in \"Close Encounters of The Third Kind,\" \"American Graffiti\" and \"The Goodbye Girl,\" a performance for which he received an Oscar. The venue's executive director didn't respond immediately to emails Tuesday, and a representative for Dreyfuss could not be reached.\n\n\"We deeply regret that Mr. Dreyfuss's comments during the event were not in line with the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold at The Cabot. We understand that his remarks were distressing and offensive to many of our community members, and for that, we sincerely apologize,\" The Cabot's statement said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He also slandered transgender people and their parents. \"He said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds,\" one audience member told The Boston Globe.\n\nThe audience didn't take Dreyfuss' comments sitting down, with some vocally protesting his views and several people leaving the event.

It was an apologetic follow-up to an event titled \"An Evening with Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws Screening,\" wherein the theater stressed that \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization.\" Reading about how what \"was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views,\" many wondered: what the hell did Richard Dreyfuss say to prompt such an apology?\n\nThere's still no full transcript of the event, but some scant videos and reports from attendees have filled in some of the blanks. The bizarre evening began with the Oscar winner coming out on stage doing a half-assed routine to Taylor Swift's \"Love Story\" while wearing a dress (a pair of stagehands helped him take it off, and he put on a suit jacket before sitting down). Once the actual talk began, he made remarks about women being submissive and weak that were so outrageous some attendees actually thought he was satirizing old-school Hollywood misogyny, according to The Boston Globe.\n\nInstead, it seems Dreyfuss's remarks were just actual old-school Hollywood misogyny. One social media post claims that the actor called his Nuts producer Barbra Streisand a \"genius\" but one he wouldn't listen to because she's \"a woman, and woman shouldn't have that power.\" He reportedly complained about the #MeToo movement and \"said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds,\" another attendee told the Globe. Additional video of Dreyfuss's disparaging remarks about trans kids included his opinion that \"It's not okay because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus'\" (per the Globe). According to one comment on The Cabot's Facebook page (via Deadline), \"Crowd was shouting at him and most walked out before the movie even started.\" The commenter added: \"Talk about the movie asshole.\"\n\nThese remarks are apparently in line with Dreyfuss' late-stage career (one commenter shared that he \"made anti-gay remarks\" at a similar event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire days earlier, per Deadline). Last year on PBS' Firing Line he professed that new inclusivity rules for the Academy Awards \"make me vomit.\" He explained, \"[This] is an art form. It's also a form of commerce and it makes money, but it's an art. And no one should be telling me as an artist that I have to give in to the latest, most current idea of what morality is.\"", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

They don't know that opposing views are entwined and threaded through the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and what we show to the world we believe in,\" Dreyfuss told Glenn, noting that kids don't learn about history these days the way they used to or should.\n\n\"I certainly think that when we allow our kids to tell us what is valuable and what is nurturing, we're going to the wrong people,\" he explained.\n\nBefore finishing their conversation, Dreyfuss left Glenn with a pearl of wisdom -- which is a far cry from what fans angry at his performance over the weekend seem to believe he is capable of.\n\n\"It infuriates me that people don't understand what this place means, what an advance on human progress this country is all about, and how quickly we can abandon it without a second thought,\" Dreyfuss tells Glenn.\n\n\"I once said that we hold this pearl in our hands, and then we think, 'Yeah who cares,' and we toss it away, and it lands on the top of the stairs and we trip over it and we fall down through this state of constant decay -- until we reach Donald Trump and the cheapening of every great thought, every great move that we gave to humanity. And it just kills me.\"\n\n\"It's beyond my ability to comprehend why people who are in a position to burnish our reputation make it filth, choose to make it filth. I just don't get it,\" he finished.\n\nTo enjoy more of Glenn's masterful storytelling, thought-provoking analysis, and uncanny ability to make sense of the chaos, subscribe to BlazeTV -- the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Beck", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Beck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_youth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transgender youth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political correctness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beverly, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Bill of Rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaze_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blaze Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In_Daily_Life", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/In Daily Life", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=52337393&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

However, some patrons walked out of the event before the film even started when the actor shared his opinions on gender ideology.\n\n\"He said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds,\" attendee Diane Wolf told The Boston Globe.\n\nRICHARD DREYFUSS: AMERICANS' IGNORANCE OF CONSTITUTION, DISRESPECT FOR OPPOSITION HAS DAMAGED OUR COUNTRY\n\nAt one point, the crowd shouted at Dreyfus after he said, \"It's not okay because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus,'\" according to the Globe.\n\n\"I'm queer, I'm nonbinary. This is personal to me,\" attendee Sarah Hogg said. \"It's one of those moments where you feel like you're having an out-of-body experience.

Commenters claiming to be attendees described what happened afterward.\n\nAlleged attendees described what happened afterward in the video's comment section.\n\n\"I was there - he talked about how he didn't like working with Barbra [Streisand] because she wasn't 'submissive to him enough as a woman', and then went on about how he doesn't support MeToo or LGBT, and how 10-year-olds shouldn't be able to get surgery. Later on he jabbed the crowd by mentioning his 'famous Republican friends' and so on,\" one person wrote. \"Just felt really bizarre and out of place. About 20 to 30 people walked out, not 'hundreds' like some articles state.\"\n\nAnother person also said the actor made some \"snide sexist comments\" about how Streisand was difficult to work with because she was a \"woman who should be submissive.\"\n\nSCREENWRITER DAVID MAMET BRISTLES AT HOLLYWOOD'S 'GARBAGE' DEI EFFORTS: 'IT'S FASCIST TOLTALITARIANISM'\n\nThe crowd reacted negatively to these remarks, the commenter wrote.

There was also a woman in the back left of the balcony heckling quite loudly whenever Richard made his rude/ sexist remarks (I believe she was eventually escorted out after his anti LGBT+ spiel).

It's a sad state of affairs where people are so emotional and sanctimonious that they can't even stay in the same room with someone they disagree with,\" Kyle Fiske wrote. \"And ironically, that's the whole theme of Dreyfuss's book, that people need to be able to tolerate and engage with people on different sides of the political spectrum, as that's a foundational requirement of a democratic system.

Jaws Star's Sexist Rant Sparks Apology From Massachusetts Theater After Audience Walkout", "body": "Richard Dreyfus was accused of engaging in an offensive tirade at Massachusetts Theater over the weekend. Here's what he said\n\nOscar winner Richard Dreyfus is under fire again over a sexist and homophobic rant that reportedly prompted a Massachusetts theater to issue an apology over the offensive remarks.\n\nIt all began when the Cabot hosted the 76-year-old \"Jaws\" star for \"An Evening With Richard Dreyfuss\" on Saturday, May 25, before the film's Massachusetts Theatre screening.\n\nHowever, things supposedly went off the rails as soon as Richard Dreyfus walked to the stage wearing a dress over his clothes. In a YouTube video taken by an audience member, the actor was seen on stage wearing a floral print dress, shaking his hips to Love Story by Taylor Swift in the background.\n\nShortly after, according to multiple reports citing audience members at the theater, most of the crowd walked out of the venue after the actor allegedly launched into a sexist, Homophobic and transphobic tirade.\n\nOne audience member on The Cabot's Facebook page wrote: \"We walked out of his interview tonight along with hundreds of others because of his racist, homophobic, misogynistic rant.\"\n\nWhile no event transcript was available, attendees took to social media to share Richard Dreyfus's offensive rant.\n\nA user on X shared a screenshot of a text from a friend's parents, who reportedly attended the event. According to the text, Dreyfus, while applauding Barbra Streisand as a \"genius\", added that he \"didn't listen to her\" because \"women shouldn't have that power.\"\n\nThe message also showed Dreyfus allegedly referring to an unknown actress in a movie as an \"idiot\", saying, \"She brilliant but an idiot. You know women are so passive. That's why the movie sucked.\"\n\nThe actor also allegedly slammed the #MeToo movement before going off on transgender issues.\n\nThe actor reportedly slammed parents for listening to \"10-year-olds\" with gender identity issues. Diane Wolf of Salem, who was in the audience, told the Boston Globe, \"He said that the parents of trans youth, allowing them to transition, was bad parenting and that someday those kids might change their minds.\"\n\nAccording to the publication, one comment that was captured on video showed Dreyfuss saying, \"It'ss not okay because when the kid's 15, she's going to say, 'I'm an octopus\"'\n\nAccording to the text shared by a social media user, Richard Dreyfus, who has collaborated with Steven Speilberg in several films, including Jaws and Close Encounter, allegedly called the director a \"genius\" but an \"idiot.\" Dreyfus also claimed Close Encounters was a hit because he convinced Spielberg to hire him instead of Gene Hackman.\n\nRichard Dreyfuss\" tirade prompted the theater to issue a statement to the attendees on May 27, apologizing for the event.\n\nThey said, \"The views expressed by Mr. Dreyfuss do not reflect the values of inclusivity and respect that we uphold as an organization. We deeply regret the distress that this has caused to many of our patrons.\"", "source": {"uri": "koimoi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Koimoi"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anushree_madappa@koimoi.com", "name": "Anushree Madappa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jaws (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Dreyfuss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Story_(Taylor_Swift_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love Story (Taylor Swift song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Misogyny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbra_Streisand", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbra Streisand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MeToo_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MeToo movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gene Hackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boston_Globe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Boston Globe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Spielberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Salem, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salem, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static-koimoi.akamaized.net/wp-content/new-galleries/2024/05/richard-dreyfus-sexist-rant-sparks-apology-from-massachusetts-theatre-after-audience-walkout-01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602577", "eventUri": "eng-9602577", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 423, "textEnd": 429}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 2766, "textEnd": 2772}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Severe weather across the U.S. kills 24. And actor Richard Dreyfuss' controversial comments at a \"Jaws\" screening spark backlash.\n\nHere's what to know today.\n\nClosing arguments are set to begin today in Donald Trump's hush money case. After receiving instructions from Judge Juan Merchan, 12 ordinary New Yorkers who make up the jury will determine whether the former president is guilty in his first criminal trial.\n\nProsecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office have worked to show that Trump directed a scheme to cover up an alleged sexual encounter with adult film star Stormy Daniels at a fraught moment for his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records.\n\nOver 20 days, jurors heard from star witness and Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen about his involvement in the payment to Daniels; tabloid impresario David Pecker about a \"catch and kill scheme\" he said was concocted with Cohen; and defense witness Robert Costello, whose tense exchange with Merchan was among the trial's most memorable. Here's what else happened over 20 days of testimony.\n\nThe defense will deliver its closing arguments first, with lead Trump attorney Todd Blanche expected to argue that Bragg's office has not proved that Trump is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Prosecutors are expected to argue that not only did they prove Trump was responsible for the falsified business records, but also that he did so to cover up another crime -- a necessary element of the felony charge.\n\nThe threat of severe thunderstorms, lightning, large hail, strong wind gusts and possibly a few tornadoes are possible in the Northeast this morning, the National Weather Service said. The threat follows a deadly spate of storms across the South and the Midwest.\n\nAt least 24 people were killed in severe weather over Memorial Day weekend, including in Kentucky, Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas. And in Colorado, a rancher and 34 of his cattle were killed in a lightning strike. Meanwhile, thousands of homes and businesses were without power in multiple states. Here's what else we know.\n\nPalestinians searching through charred remains described a \"horrifying\" scene of people running to escape the blaze that swept through a tent camp in Rafah, as Israeli forces pushed deeper into the southern Gaza city despite mounting global condemnation.\n\nIsraeli tanks reached the city center for the first time, according to NBC News' crew on the ground, defying international pressure to halt an offensive that has sent nearly 1 million people fleeing Rafah and left those still sheltering there facing dire conditions and deadly attacks.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday the deadly strike on the tent camp was \"tragic,\" adding that it was under investigation. The Israel Defense Forces initially said it had targeted two senior Hamas leaders and did not strike a designated humanitarian area. But it said a full investigation would be conducted into \"the deaths of civilians in the area of the strike.\"\n\nMore on the Israel-Hamas war:\n\nA Massachusetts theater is distancing itself from actor Richard Dreyfuss, who reportedly made controversial comments during a \"Jaws\" screening. According to The Boston Globe, witnesses said Dreyfuss disparaged women in film, the MeToo movement and LGBTQ rights during a Saturday event billed \"An evening with Richard Dreyfuss + Jaws screening.\" A spokesperson for the Cabot Theater in Beverly released a statement yesterday expressing regret for the \"distress\" it caused to patrons. The statement continued: \"We regret that an event that was meant to be a conversation to celebrate an iconic movie instead became a platform for political views.\"\n\nDreyfuss, whose starring role in the 1975 blockbuster \"Jaws\" made him a top-shelf Hollywood performer, has been the source of controversial comments in recent years.\n\nUkraine is desperately seeking new soldiers, but some men are desperately trying to avoid being called up. With a shortage of soldiers on the battlefield, Ukraine has taken action to bolster its army, including the passage of a mobilization law that makes more men eligible to be enlisted, increased fines for draft dodging and a decision to withhold consular services from Ukrainian men abroad who lack up-to-date military documents.\n\nSoldiers on the front lines said they wholeheartedly support the measures. But a growing number of men across the country are fearful of being drafted into the army as Russia launches a fresh wave of attacks. Exacerbating fears among draft-eligible men are videos circulating on social media showing altercations between civilians and recruitment officers, leaving many apprehensive to venture into public spaces. Others are looking for ways to escape abroad -- even though men ages 18 to 60 are barred from leaving the country -- even if it means risking death.\n\nTexas elections: Moderate GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales is fighting to keep his seat from MAGA firebrand Brandon Herrera in Texas' 23rd Congressional District, stretching from San Antonio to El Paso. And state House Speaker Dade Phelan, who oversaw impeachment proceedings against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is up against conservative activist David Covey in a bitter primary fight for the Republican Party's future.\n\nImmigration: The Biden administration is giving immigration judges and asylum officers more access to classified information to help them determine if any migrants might have ties to terrorism or pose a threat to public safety after an NBC News story revealed that an Afghan migrant on the terrorist watchlist was released at the border.\n\nWant more politics news?

He reportedly also described Steven Spielberg, who directed Jaws, as \"a genius but an idiot\".\n\nAccording to AP, Dreyfuss received applause when he ended the discussion by referencing his book, \"One Thought Scares Me...\" and his opinion that civics is no longer being taught in classrooms, to the country's detriment.

Paige Baptiste, 21, and Lesha Johnson, 24, were originally charged with attempted murder in connection with the attack on Z\u2019annie Charles, 20, who was 16 at the time. However, the charge was reduced to wounding with intent and a jury found them guilty of the lesser charge. On Friday, at High Court No. 2, in Kingstown, Lewis asked Justice Rickie Burnett to order his clients to pay Charles EC$5,000 in compensation. He said the social inquiry report aligns with the practice direction that the court should avoid criminalising young offenders. Lewis further said that the victim had stated in court that the permanent scar she has on her face as a result of her injuries does not make her less attractive to men or less likely to get a job. \u201c\u2026 the victim clearly stated to the court, pompously, that she could get a new man; that doesn\u2019t prevent her from getting a man; she can still get a man and it does not prevent her from getting a job,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cShe even pompously said that she made a video while she was in hospital, saying when she comes back she will take anybody\u2019s man.\u201d The lawyer further said that when the person who prepared the social inquiry report contacted Charles, she said, \u201cMiss, let me make your work easier.\u2019 \u201cAnd that was it. She didn\u2019t want to discuss anything. That pomposity in court may well have been the reason for the initiation of the challenges that came for her and not as an example of any trauma,\u201d Lewis told the court. He said that when Charles gave evidence before the court, \u201cthere was no indication that [she had] suffered from any trauma as a result of the injury. \u201cThe doctor clearly said that it healed perfectly well. I am standing about 10 feet away from the box, you can see no mark at all; none you will see on the face of the individual.\u201d He and the trio were friends and the social inquiry report confirmed his suggestion of counselling, generally, and for anger management, specifically. Lewis said that the report was \u201cbased on psychological analysis in which there may have been an attempt to go into psychiatric analysis, but it stopped halfway\u201d. \u2018an archaic statement\u2019 He took issue with the report\u2019s author\u2019s suggestion that the court impose a sentence befitting the crime. The report also concluded that the defendants are good candidates for rehabilitation and may benefit from anger and conflict resolution sessions. \u201cThis old maxim that the court imposes a sentence befitting the crime should be avoided, especially in situations where the report provides information that is contrary,\u201d Lewis told the court. Lewis said it is \u201can archaic statement, especially when it comes to sentencing and sentencing guidelines where the punishment is always qualified by societal factors, cultural factors.\u201d The lawyer reminded the court of the sentencing principles concerning people below 18, adding, \u201c\u2026 it is rather amazing that precisely what this direction is saying that we should avoid, all those factors are identified in the social inquiry report.\u201d Lewis said the guidelines say there should be a focus on the individual, especially when the offender is under 18. He added that the practice direction further said that factors that should be given serious consideration in determining the sentence are deprived homes, poor parental employment, low educational attainment, early experience of offending by family members, experience of abuse and or neglect, negative influences from peers and associates and the misuse of drugs and alcohol. Lewis said the social inquiry report points to several adverse childhood experiences in Baptiste\u2019s life, including paternal neglect, emotional and physical abuse, exposure to domestic violence, abuse and becoming a young mother when she was 13 or 14. He further told the court that the practice direction said that to criminalise is to impose a stigma. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not only the impact on the individual offender but also the welfare of the offender,\u201d he said, adding that Baptiste\u2019s 6-year-old son talks about self-harm. \u201cWhy? Because in school they\u2019re talking about his mother being in prison. So that has started already. \u2018When is your mother coming home?\u2019 The impact is not only on that individual\u2019s life, personally, but also the life of a son,\u201d the lawyer said. Lawyer suggests community service The lawyer also recommended that the court consider ordering community service. \u201cThat is also very good because what it does is that it demonstrates and shows that within the community that work not only helps to mend bridges, but it also helps to impose a responsibility on the individual to recognise and accept that what was done may have had some impact on the community,\u201d he said. He also referred the court to an Antiguan case where a young man was beaten, knocked unconscious and ended up in intensive care with punctured lungs and broken bones but his assailant did not serve prison time before he was a minor. \u201cThat child wasn\u2019t given a custodial sentence,\u201d Lewis said, adding, \u201cI implore you in the circumstances to look at those things very carefully, to review my recommendations as I stated them\u2026\u201d", "summary": "<img width=\"150\" height=\"81\" src=\"https://cdn.iwnsvg.com/uploads/2024/06/Leisha-Johnson-and-Paige-Baptiste-150x81.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"Leisha Johnson and Paige Baptiste\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://cdn.iwnsvg.com/uploads/2024/06/Leisha-Johnson-and-Paige-Baptiste-150x81.jpg 150w, https://cdn.iwnsvg.com/uploads/2024/06/Leisha-Johnson-and-Paige-Baptiste-300x163.jpg 300w, https://cdn.iwnsvg.com/uploads/2024/06/Leisha-Johnson-and-Paige-Baptiste.jpg 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" title=\"Lawyer asks court not to jail Greiggs women for cutlass attack 1\">A lawyer has asked the court not to jail two Geriggs women who attacked another villager with a cutlass and a knife on Jan. 29, 2020, when they were all...", "url": "https://www.iwnsvg.com/2024/06/09/lawyer-asks-court-not-to-jail-greiggs-women-for-cutlass-attack/", "image": "https://cdn.iwnsvg.com/uploads/2024/06/Leisha-Johnson-and-Paige-Baptiste.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:38:11", "author": "News Admin", "authors": ["News Admin"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "vc", "sentiment": -0.526}

That includes Scripps officials, production staff and college-aged volunteers, many of whom are former spellers.\n\n\"We help the kids have a great experience, you know, interact with the parents and their siblings and really make sure that they're having a really positive time at Bee week and really foster that sense of love of spelling and vocabulary,\" said Tara Singh, college crew co-leader.\n\nSingh was 8 years old during her first appearance on the national stage. This marks her 11th year being active in the spelling bee universe.\n\n\"You can't keep away,\" Singh said. \"There's something so special about the spelling bee. I say this to everyone I meet.\"\n\nHer college crew co-leader, Amelia Ballingall, has been participating or volunteering in spelling bees since second grade, and that deep experience with words and language inspired her college major.\n\nScripps Spelling Bee\n\nExcitement builds as 96th Scripps National Spelling Bee kicks off Maya Rodriguez 12:22 PM, May 27, 2024\n\n\"I had worked with kids throughout high school, and then looking into what I wanted to do in college, I stumbled across the major that I'm in now: speech therapy. It kind of brought together working with kids and linguistics,\" Ballingall said.\n\nBut the Bee Week experience is about more than just what happens on stage. Singh and Ballingall said Scripps does a great job planning activities and experiences away from the main stage to ensure the spellers and their families enjoy the entire week.\n\nSome of those experiences include field trips around the Washington D.C. area and team challengers with prizes on the line.\n\nSo whether it's spellers, families or staff, Bee Week is a unique environment where a passion for words can develop into lifetime friendships.\n\nAnd once the 2024 National Spelling Bee champion has been crowned, attention will quickly turn to next year when the Bee will celebrate its 100th anniversary.", "source": {"uri": "denver7.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Denver 7 Colorado News (KMGH)"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephanie_liebergen@denver7.com", "name": "Stephanie Liebergen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_National_Spelling_Bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scripps National Spelling Bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spelling_bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spelling bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech\u2013language_pathology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speech\u2013language pathology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maya civilization"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Software", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Software", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill_and_Spell", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Spill and Spell", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Apitherapy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Apitherapy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/990eb78/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2Fa8%2F5c%2F4f1d1b4646948a249cef4a2cc833%2Fap23153091302352.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9602929", "eventUri": "eng-9602929", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Jacques Bailly, the Bee's official pronouncer, has devoted his life to spreading the knowledge of words.\n\nMore than 200 spellers are competing this week during the 2024 Scripps National Spelling Bee in one of the largest fields since 2019. National qualifiers advanced through local and regional bees earlier this spring.\n\nRepeat state champion Aiden Wijeyakulasuriya of Madison and runner-up Nethraa Muthupandiyaraja of Franklin were the best of the bunch at the March 16 Badger State Spelling Bee at Madison College's Mitby Theater. The two, among a group of 50 spellers, both advance to the Scripps National Spelling Bee on May 28.\n\nHere's how to watch the Scripps Spelling Bee this year, and what to know about the event:\n\nWhen is the Scripps Spelling Bee?\n\nThe competition started May 26 and the preliminary round starts May 28 and the finals are May 30. The semifinals are May 29 and the next day's finals are broadcast on the ION television channel from 7 to 9 p.m.\n\nHow can I watch the 2024 Spelling Bee?\n\nION is available free over the air, and most cable, satellite and streaming services. You can find your ION provider at spellingbee.com/watch. You can also watch, pause and record the Spelling Bee on Ion with Tablo.\n\nHas anyone from Wisconsin ever won the Scripps National Spelling Bee?\n\nYes, but just one person. Joanne Lagatta of Clintonville won the competition in 1991 by correctly spelling the word \"antipyretic.\"\n\nRecently, Maya Jadhav won the state competition four times in a row and that may be the record, Wisconsin Public Radio reported.\n\nHow does the Scripps National Spelling Bee work exactly?\n\nBefore spellers can get to the national competition, they have to compete at the regional level and, often, other smaller competitions like at the school level. The Badger State Spelling Bee is a regional competition, consisting of 17 rounds until a winner is determined, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.\n\nOn the national level, the competition is in four phases: preliminaries, quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. Each phase has at least one round, where spellers either spell a word or answer multiple-choice vocabulary questions. Spellers get 90 seconds for each of their turns for spelling and 30 seconds for multiple-choice vocab questions.\n\nThings change a bit for the finals. If all spellers misspell a word, a new round begins and all get to compete. If only one answers correctly, a new round begins and the correct speller gets a chance to win by spelling a word from the \"championship word list.\" If they spell it correctly, they win. If not, the cycle repeats.\n\nThere's one more factor, though, since the spelling bee is on live television. If no one has won 1 hour and 55 minutes into the finals, and if it hasn't yet reached a championship word round, a spell-off begins. The spell-off can also happen in two other scenarios, both also having to do with either getting too close to or reaching 1 hour and 55 minutes.\n\nIn the case of a spell-off, it becomes a speed test of sorts. Spellers are given 90 seconds to spell as many words as they can and whoever spells the most right is declared the winner. If it's a tie, it's a tie.\n\nWho won the 2023 Spelling Bee?\n\nIn June 2023, Dev Shah became the 2023 Scripps National Spelling Bee Champion. The 14-year-old from Largo, Florida, won during his third appearance at the national competition.", "source": {"uri": "jsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Journal Sentinel"}, "authors": [],

She said the preteen would like to make it to the quarter finals.\n\nAarav, 12, a seventh-grade Lyford Cay International School (LCIS) student has been putting in approximately five to six hours a week, three to four days a week since March with Stine. He and Stine's sessions together focused on \"Two Bee\" words which are vocabulary as spellers need to know the definitions of words in a multiple-choice format.\n\nStine, an English teacher at LCIS, said Aarav's words have been selected from the Merriam Webster dictionary and provided to them by Scripps in a study guide.\n\nThe national champion's preparation has also included coaching with schoolmate Roy Seligman, who has inked his name in the annals of the national spelling championship as a four-time Bahamian champion, as well as in the history books of Scripps, as the first Bahamian to advance to the finals of the competition since The Bahamas began competing at Scripps in 1998. Roy made the finals of the 93rd Scripps Spelling Bee in 2021. He tied for fourth place with three other spellers.\n\nAarav coached with Roy via Zoom four hours per week. Their sessions focused on \"Three Bees\" words, which are strictly spelling.\n\nHe also coached with Demetria Rolle from the Ministry of Education, who also set up Zoom sessions with Eckward Ferguson, who traveled with Aarav to the May 26-31 competition at Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center. Their sessions focused on Latin/Greek roots and also took the route of mock bees.\n\nAarav is speller number eight for the Washington, D.C. competition.\n\nEckward, 12, an eighth-grade student at Central Eleuthera High School, is speller number nine.\n\nThe duo's sessions with Rolle focused on Latin/Greek roots and were also mock Bees.\n\nAarav, according to his coach also used Word Club and Spelling Pundit games to increase fluency and accuracy.\n\nAccording to Stine, Aarav feels that the upcoming Scripps experience will be \"cool\" and a great experience to meet others at the highest level of spelling bee.\n\nThere's much more to the Scripps National Spelling Bee than the nationally-televised competition. Bee Week is a week-long experience for spellers and their families that includes special events, educational workshops, excursions into Washington, D.C. and more.\n\nStine said the preteen is looking forward to the picnic and the Bee Bash and all the other fun activities planned around the actual competitions.\n\nScripps can be watched on Ion Plus for the preliminaries and quarterfinals on Tuesday, May 28 from 8 a.m. to 7:40 p.m., and Wednesday, May 29 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., respectively; and the semifinals and finals on Ion on Wednesday, May 29 and Thursday, May 30 between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. nightly.\n\nAfter winning the 27th national title with the word bromeliad, Aarav said he was eager to begin preparation for Scripps, and said spelling wasn't just about memorizing words, but learning about the roots, origins, and parts of speech.\n\nAarav and Eckward will be among 245 spellers at the 2024 Bee representing all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Department of Defense Schools in Europe. Spellers will also represent three countries outside the U.S. - The Bahamas, Canada and Ghana.\n\nThis year's spelling competition features one eight-year-old, five nine-year-olds, eight 10-year-olds, 26 eleven-year-olds, 46 twelve-year-olds, 89 thirteen-year-olds, 69 fourteen-year-olds, and one 15-year-old.\n\nThere will be 103 female spellers, 141 male spellers, and one who preferred not to answer, contesting for the top title\n\nTwenty-four spellers have relatives who have participated in a combined 40 Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nComing into this year, 65 spellers have previously competed in the Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nThe champion will walk away with a $50,000 cash prize, commemorative medal and the Scripps Cup from Scripps National Spelling Bee; a $2,500 cash prize and reference library from Merriam-Webster; $400 of reference works, including a 1768 Encyclopaedia Britannica Replica Set and a three-year membership to Britannica Online Premium.\n\nThe National Spelling Bee began in 1925 when nine newspapers joined together to host a spelling bee. Little did they know that almost a century later, their literacy effort would reach millions of students each year.\n\nFrank Neuhauser was 11-years-old when he won the first bee in 1925. He was also the first male winner. He won a stack of gold coins worth $500 and a visit with United States President Calvin Coolidge.\n\nThe first female champion was Pauline Bell (1926).\n\nJody-Anne Maxwell, from Jamaica, became the first Black winner and first non-American bee champion in 1998. Zaila Avant-garde became the first Black American winner in 2021.\n\nThe youngest competitor was Edith Fuller, six-years-old in 2017.\n\nIn 2019, eight co-winners were dubbed the \"Octochamps\" and hold the Guinness World Record for \"Most winners of the Scripps National Spelling Bee (single competition).\"\n\nOf the 108 total champions, 53 have been girls and 55 boys - 33 were 14-year-olds, 53 were 13-year-olds, 19 were 12-year-olds, and three were 11-year-olds.\n\nCompetitors from Texas comprise the winningest state with 16. It is also the only double-digit state. The next winningest state is Ohio with nine.\n\nThe longest word was \"scherenschnitte\" (2015); the shortest word was \"luge\" (1984).\n\nThe longest one-day competition took place in 1957. The 30th Scripps National Spelling Bee started at 9 a.m. and lasted until 6:55 p.m. - almost 10 hours. Dana Bennett, 13, from Denver, and Sandra Owen, 14, from Navarre, Ohio, were declared co-champions after the word list was exhausted. Both failed to spell the final word: \"schappe\".\n\nThe 2023 Scripps National Spelling Bee was won by Dev Shah, who correctly spelled \"psammophile\" in his third appearance at the competition.\n\nThere have been four years when a spelling bee was canceled - 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 1945 because of World War II, 1944 because of World War II and 1943, because of World War II.", "source": {"uri": "thenassauguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nassau Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shavaughn_moss@thenassauguardian.com", "name": "Shavaughn Moss", "type":

(Scripps News)\n\nUnder the bright lights, 245 spellers will take the stage this week at National Harbor, near Washington, D.C., for the 96th Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nThe spellers are coming in from all 50 states and from countries in places as far away as Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. All of them are part of the competition's largest group of spellers in five years. Among them is 13-year-old Oviya Amalraj of Virginia.\n\n\"I like how it's just you focus on the word and there's an order to how you do it,\" she said.\n\nThis will be her second time at the Bee, after reaching 23rd place last year. This year, the black belt in tae kwon do hopes to kick her way into the top spot by applying some of the skills she's learned in that martial art.\n\n\"I liked how it was like physical and you had to focus a lot,\" Oviya said of her interest in tae kwon do.\n\nWhile she spends some of her free time on the guitar and the piano, Oviya is not the only musician buzzing their way to this year's Bee. Ethan Dunlap, of North Carolina, is another speller who also moonlights as a musician.\n\n\"I actually picked it up back in the 7th grade. My dad used to be a saxophone player,\" Ethan said. \"My great-grandfather also played the saxophone. So, I just carried the traits, I guess, and I got pretty good at it.\"\n\nFor Ethan, 12, this will be his first trip to the Bee, and he was thrilled to find out he qualified after winning his local spelling bee.\n\n\"Oh my gosh! I've won and I'm getting to go to the Scripps National Spelling Bee!\" he recalled. \"It's really awesome. I can't wait to go out there and spell my best.\"\n\nIt's a chance Ethan and his fellow spellers are about to get.\n\nThe spelling bee begins in earnest Tuesday, with all 245 competitors getting their chance to spell on stage during the preliminary round.\n\nFrom there, the field will slowly dwindle through the quarterfinals and semifinals on Wednesday, before Thursday night's final round and the crowning of a new Bee champion. Watch it all here.\n\nScripps News is a subsidiary of the E.W.

So, it's very, very hard for me to make a mistake.\"\n\nHe also understands exactly what these spellers are dealing with because he's been in their shoes. Bailly is a former Bee champion, winning the competition back in 1980.

He returned to the buzz of the Bee for one main reason.\n\n\"I really just enjoyed being in the spelling bee,\" he said. \"I enjoyed that competition. I enjoyed the camaraderie and I love words.\"\n\nScripps Spelling Bee\n\nBehind the scenes at the Scripps National Spelling Bee Stephanie Liebergen 4:45 PM, May 27, 2024\n\nAs for this week's competition, Bailly offers this advice to those who want to follow in his steps and become a Bee champion.\n\n\"My biggest advice for spellers is that you should study really hard and learn as much as you can,\" Bailly said. \"Spell it the way you think it should be spelled. Go with your gut and go with a simple spelling because most words in the end are sort of spelled the way they sound.\"\n\nYou can watch the Scripps National spelling bee semi-finals Wednesday at 8 pm ET on the ION channel.

like getting up there and kind of performing.\"\n\nI asked Cadi to pick a challenging word for me to spell and see if she could stump me.\n\nShe gave me \"Ardhamagadhi,\" which is \"a Prakrit language of north India used in a large part of the Jain canon,\" according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary.\n\nI soon regretted my decision to be quizzed as I very quickly spelled that word wrong but Cadi decided to give me a second chance, next selecting the word, \"Dendrochronology.\"\n\nIt means the science of dating tree rings and the study of climate and atmosphere through wood on trees.\n\nI almost got that word, only missing an \"O\" near the end.\n\nCadi said the long words are especially difficult when under pressure, it's easy to forget a pesky vowel.\n\nSpelling isn't Cadi's only skill and she's a talented pianist with big dreams.\n\n\"I think I'd like to pursue some career in astrophysics or astronomy, stuff like that,\" she said.\n\nCadi is one of more than 200 spellers, including four from Utah, who are already in Maryland getting ready for the competition this week.\n\nREAD: South Jordan student one of 4 Utah contestants in Scripps National Spelling Bee\n\nThe

Cell phones and computers have no problem storing the entire corpus of the English dictionary and consulting it at a moment's notice. Like all games and sports, spelling bees aren't strictly speaking necessary or useful - at least not in an immediately practical way. Yet questions about spelling bees' utility (or lack thereof) miss what makes them so beloved - why it broke spellers' and logophiles' hearts when the Scripps National Spelling Bee was cancelled in 2020 amid the pandemic; why the Bee was quickly revived in 2021 and 2022, with altered rules and a partially virtual format; and why the Bee continues to captivate people internationally, motivating countries like Jamaica, China, and Ghana to send teams to Washington DC to compete.\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence is provoking a great deal of anxiety these days. The development of machine-learning technologies which vastly outstrip human abilities forces us to meditate upon what, in the final analysis, differentiates us from AIs. It also compels us to consider which spheres of human life we think ought to be automated, and which activities we feel should be defended against AI incursions.\n\nAlthough the development of ChatGPT and other potent natural language processing models marks a new, potentially dangerous phase of the digital age, computers have eclipsed humans for decades without destroying the landscape of intellectual sports. The IBM computer Deep Blue vanquished international grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, and IBM Watson trounced all-time Jeopardy! champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011. Despite these victories for AI over raw human intellect, people still follow competitive chess and watch quiz shows. Likewise, the National Spelling Bee inspires considerable buzz annually, although we're now decades into the era of spell-checking software. Spelling bees, chess matches and quiz shows are celebrations of human skill, training, attainment and grace under pressure. Whether machines can duplicate or surpass the achievements of flesh-and-blood competitors is beside the point. And since computers can't experience nerves and jitters, it is impossible to replicate the lived experience of a human competitor using a machine substitute.\n\nThere is a remarkable thrill to watching spellers - who are generally between the ages of nine and 14 - figure out a word on stage, in real time, subject to high degrees of pressure. Spellers have just 75 seconds to ask any questions and 90 seconds total to spell. The ballroom where the spelling happens is a highly pressurized environment. The tension is incredibly sharp - even if you're watching on TV, you sense spellers' focus and the force of their concentration. Spellers perform a mental tightrope walk: one misstep, one missed letter, and a journey which has encompassed years and thousands of hours of targeted practice and linguistic study is all over. It is all or nothing: absolute, brutal, and exhilarating to witness.\n\nCompetitive spellers are \"word detectives\". They receive a training in applied linguistics, often practicing with parents, teachers, and coaches like me. Spellers amass a vast repertoire of Latin and Greek stems - there are at least 800 in my textbook Words of Wisdom - which they can then use to analyze almost any Latin or Greek-derived word. They master the phonetic rules which structure the orthographic systems of French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, Greek and German. They train their unconscious mind to detect patterns, and they cultivate a sense of when a word is likely to be an exception to the phonetic rules. They acquire the capacity to develop and refine a hypothesis about a word's spelling in real time using Bayesian inference - iteratively updating their initial hypothesis before they begin spelling based on the answers they receive to their questions.\n\nSpelling isn't just about dotting your I's and crossing your T's. Just like good writing, spelling is to a great extent about the art of paying close, undivided attention. Indeed, attention is the most important element of being a champion speller. Spellers must closely attend to a word's etymology, the nuances of which may hint that they need to break a language's usual spelling rules. They must carefully consider the part of speech - in French words, for example, the plural endings -s and -x are generally silent. They must observe and sieve the definition, hunting for keywords: generally, if a word is Latin or Greek, the definition will contain one to three words which are clues to the roots. And they must ponder all pronunciations: if a word has multiple pronunciations, their spelling must satisfy them all, or their spelling is likely to be mistaken.\n\nNowadays, paying sustained attention is vital and increasingly difficult, a product of cell phones, the internet and \"brain fog\". In a world where our consciousness is pulled in a million different directions, the National Spelling Bee is a celebration of knowledge, discipline and focus. Each year, the competition showcases what undivided attention can accomplish. Spellers' feats of orthographic prowess, executed under high pressure only through intense effort, are an inspiration for us to strengthen our powers of concentration, an invitation for us to attend to the wondrous world around us, even as we're faced with omnipresent distraction.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

When they spell a word incorrectly, they are eliminated. All spellers eliminated within the same round are tied for the same place. The champion is awarded a $50,000 cash prize.\n\nTwo spellers hail from Concord, alongside one speller from Mooresville. The other North Carolinians in this year's cohort represent Durham, Wake, Harnett, Cumberland and Johnston Counties, respectively.\n\nNo one from North Carolina has won the competition since 1970.\n\nHere's a look at the eight spellers from North Carolina, and one Charlotte-area speller from Clover, South Carolina, based on their bios on the spelling bee website:\n\nAishwarya Kallakuri, 13, is in seventh grade at Valor Preparatory Academy, a public charter school in Concord. She enjoys reading, writing and learning new languages in her spare time. She also likes to sing classical south Indian music with her mom and play badminton with her dad. She hopes to one day pursue a career in psychology or neurology as well as help future spellers achieve their dreams.\n\nAnanya Rao Prassanna\n\nAnanya Rao Prassanna, 13, is in seventh grade at Davis Drive Middle School in Cary. This isn't her first rodeo: she previously competed in the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2022 and 2023, tying for 49th and 74th place, respectively. Prassanna has been a voracious reader from a young age, and she particularly enjoys books by Rick Riordan. In her free time, she enjoys practicing kathak, a type of Indian classical dance, and trying new foods.\n\nHarini Jayakumar, 11, attends sixth grade at The Brawley School in Mooresville. She's an avid fan of the Harry Potter books and is a member of her school's Battle of the Books team, where students read books and test their knowledge on the texts they've read in a competition. She also enjoys participating in science and math fairs. Jayakumar loves playing softball in her spare time. She previously competed in the Scripps National Spelling Bee in 2022, tying for 89th place.\n\nPhaneendra Bulusu, 12, is in sixth grade at Harris Road Middle School in Concord. He enjoys reading, playing chess and playing the flute. He also enjoys listening to music by his favorite musician, Northern Irish flutist Sir James Galway. In his spare time, Bulusu likes playing outdoors with his friends. His favorite word is caoutchouc - a type of rubber.\n\nJohannes Roxburgh, 13, is in seventh grade at Voyager Academy, a public charter school in Durham. His greatest passion is cooking: he once made a 13-course tasting menu for his family, complete with pan-seared duck with shaved asparagus and five-spice ice cream with almond tuiles. When Roxburgh isn't spelling, he loves performing in musical theater productions and watching horror movies.\n\nAngelo Aldoph, 14, is an eighth grader at R. Max Abbott Middle School in Fayetteville. He plays several instruments, including piano, violin and Okinawan drum. Aldoph and his little brother, Danielo, love to play computer coding games together, and Aldoph hopes to one day become a computer programmer. He's back at the Scripps National Spelling Bee after also competing last year, when he tied for 173rd place.\n\nEthan Dunlap, 12, is in eighth grade at Overhills Middle School in Harnett County. He's something of a math whiz. For the past three years, he's tutored others in math and has his own YouTube channel where he posts his problem-solving strategies. In his spare time, he enjoys reading adventure, fantasy and mystery books as well as playing volleyball. Dunlap is also a proud Boy Scout.\n\nOrrin Lam, 14, is in eighth grade at McGee's Crossroads Middle School in Johnston County. While this is Lam's first appearance at the Scripps National Spelling Bee, he's practiced since second grade and is thrilled to get his shot at the national competition. Lam loves math and science, and in his free time, he enjoys playing Minecraft and running track.\n\nMallory Greene, 14, is an eighth-grader at Clover Middle School just across the state border in Clover, South Carolina. She loves playing word games, shopping and spending time outdoors with friends and her three outdoor cats, Milky, Buttertoast and Cloudy. Greene also plays the flute in her regional band.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He enjoys reading books of all kinds and is a fan of Marvel movies. His favorite subject is math because he sees it as a puzzle. His favorite author is Brandon Mull, best known for his children's fantasy series, \"Fablehaven.\"\n\nBenjamin's favorite athletes are Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell and San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy.\n\nThe bee will begin with a field of 245 spellers from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Canada, the Bahamas, Germany and Ghana. The field is the largest since 2019.\n\nTuesday's preliminaries at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center will be streamed on ION Plus, Bounce XL, Grit Xtra, Laff More and spellingbee.com from 5 a.m. to their conclusion, expected to be around 4:40 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time.\n\nThe bee is limited to students in eighth grade or below and who were born Sept. 1, 2008 or later. Contestants for the 96th edition of the national bee range in age from 8 to 15.\n\nThe bee will conclude Thursday. The winner will receive $50,000 from the Scripps National Spelling Bee, $2,500 and a reference library from the dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster and $400 in reference works from Encyclopedia

Both years he represented The Indianapolis News.\n\nThe 2024 Scripps National Spelling Bee will be held May 28 to 30 in National Harbor, Md. The competition will start with 245 competitors, including six from Indiana. This area will be represented by Miah Miller, 13, a seventh grader at Creekside Middle School, who is sponsored by the Indiana University School of Education at Indiana University-Purdue University.\n\nBack in the day\n\nCompared to today's Scripps National Spelling Bee, 1974 and 1975 bees were much smaller and simpler. About 80 contestants competed each year.\n\n\"The first time doing anything, the anxiety is higher,\" Ogle said. \"I remember my mom was giving me grief. She said, 'Come on, Mark, you need to study more. You don't want to embarrass yourself.'\"\n\nOgle placed 38th in the 1974 National Spelling Bee after missing the word \"ligustrum.\"\n\nIn 1975, Ogle returned to Washington, D.C., with the advantage of experience, and he spelled his way to a showdown with competitor Hugh Tosteson Garcia, an eighth-grader from Puerto Rico.\n\nOgle stumbled first, missing the word \"brilliantine.\"\n\nGarcia correctly spelled \"brilliantine\" and then aced \"incisor\" for the win.\n\nOgle had to settle for runner-up, which earned him $500.\n\nMore than spelling\n\nBoth years, the days before and after the National Spelling Bee competition were a mad dash of parties and sightseeing trips for the young spellers and their families.\n\nThe 1974 bee was Ogle's first visit to Washington, D.C.\n\nA political junkie, he enjoyed staying in the historic Mayflower Hotel, which served as the National Spelling Bee headquarters both years.\n\n\"I remember seeing Hubert Humphrey in the lobby,\" he said.\n\nHe enjoyed visiting the White House.In 1974, the spellers attended a reception hosted by First Lady Pat Nixon. In 1975, First Lady Betty Ford came out on the balcony over the Rose Garden to greet the group.\n\nIn 1975, Will Geer, the actor who played Grandpa Walton on the iconic 1970s TV show \"The Waltons,\" mingled with spellers and their families during the week while filming a TV special about the National Spelling Bee.\n\n\"I think competing in the National Spelling Bee really helped me learn how to perform under pressure or scrutiny,\" he said. \"That whole process of being on stage and having to spell, helped me overcome anxiety.\"\n\nIt also taught him resiliency.\n\n\"Even though I did well, I finished second and lost. No matter how good you are at something there's a chance others will be better,\" he said.\n\nSince the bee\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Ogle earned his bachelor's degree in history from Wabash College in 1983 and his medical degree from Indiana University School of Medicine in 1987.

He is speller number 142 in this year's Scripps National Spelling Bee, but if you asked him just a few months ago, Eli had no idea his life would have taken a spontaneous turn like this.\n\nIn January, Eli discovered he had a spelling bee to participate in, which he believed to only be for one of his classes. After a tie-breaking round, he won, and moved forward to the regional competition against 25 peers from districts including Chester, Cornwall, Goshen, Minisink Valley, Monroe-Woodbury, Port Jervis, Valley Central, Warwick Valley and Washingtonville.\n\nEli won at the regional level on March 21, but even then he was surprised when the people around him, including those from sponsor Orange-Ulster BOCES, told him he'd earned a spot competing at the national level.\n\n\"Going into nationals, I'm feeling really confident and also excited to even be there,\" he said in a phone interview Thursday before making the trip to National Harbor, just outside Washington, D.C., over the holiday weekend.\n\nEli said he was looking forward to exploring a new place during the trip.\n\nIn his free time, Eli enjoys playing video games with his friends, particularly Fortnite and Overwatch. He also aspires to be an anesthesiologist when he grows up, and some of his favorite TV shows encouraged his interest.\n\n\"I think what made me want to be an anesthesiologist are 'The Good Doctor' and 'Grey's Anatomy',\" he said.\n\nEli is being sponsored by Orange-Ulster BOCES for the competition and since he won the regional competition to earn a spot on the national stage, Eli's mother, Shakirah Ren\u00e9e Jemerson said, his room and board are covered for the spelling bee. Transportation, food and all other expenses associated with the trip, though, are up to his family to cover. In the weeks leading up to the big event, a GoFundMe page created to help defray the costs raised $3,850 for Eli.\n\n\"We're extremely excited, surprised and thankful that with trying new things and stepping out there, he was able to win [regionals],\" Jemerson said. \"Either way, we got a winner on our hands.\"\n\nWho is Noah Kaplan, Speller 143\n\nNoah Kaplan, 12, is a seventh grader from Van Wyck Junior High School in Wappingers Falls, and is speller number 143 in this year's Scripps National Spelling Bee. This year's event is the second time he has competed at the national level.\n\nNoah, who underwent oral surgery days before leaving for the competition, said Friday he was still feeling nervous about competing, but he had a specific goal this year.\n\n\"I want to get past the round I got out on last year, hopefully get to the quarterfinals,\" he said. \"I'd be overjoyed if I got there.\"\n\nIn the 2023 competition, Noah misspelled \"sonography.\" This year he planned a few simple techniques to help him get through the big moment, including taking a deep breath on stage and trying to use his allotted time wisely.\n\nNoah's regional competition was conducted virtually on March 30 while he was on a cruise with his family over spring break. He'd felt nervous the entire trip leading up to the contest. Coming away with the win, and another shot at the national competition, gave him a chance to relax for the rest of his trip.\n\nIn his free time, Noah enjoys bowling with his dad, going to tennis lessons every Saturday, playing the cello and sometimes the piano, building with Lego, watching movies and eating hamburgers.\n\nNoah enjoyed the entire program Scripps prepared for the contestants last year, with activities including an ice breaker scavenger hunt throughout the hotel where they were staying, a Lego-building activity to socialize, as well as a dinner at the end of it all to celebrate the winner and see the other contestants one more time.\n\nThis summer, he's looking forward to going to music camp for the cello, an outdoors camp with pools and sports he's been attending for the past seven years, a tennis camp, and ending the summer off with another cruise with his family.\n\nWhen he grows up, Noah says he wants to go into the medical field and perform surgeries. \"Since I was in fourth grade, I really wanted to become a neurosurgeon,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- A four-letter word sent Shradha Rachamreddy to a third-place finish in last year's Scripps National Spelling Bee.\n\nAs the remaining spellers dwindled, Shradha was given \"orle,\" a heraldry term that means several small charges arranged to form a border within the edge of a field. It sounds exactly like \"oral.\" Shradha went with \"orel\" and heard the dreaded bell that signals a misspelled word.\n\n\"I overcomplicated it,\" Shradha said nearly a year later. \"It looks simple. It should have been simple, but I missed it.\"\n\nThe good news for Shradha was that she nearly won it all as a seventh-grader, meaning she had one year of eligibility left. The 14-year-old from San Jose, California, returned as one of 245 spellers competing in this year's bee, which began with Tuesday's preliminary rounds at a convention center outside Washington, D.C.\n\nLike other returning spellers, Shradha tried to learn from her mistake. She devoted part of her studying this year to the sorts of words she tends to miss.\n\n\"I did miss on a four-letter word, so my weakness tends to be those super short, tricky words, and I worked on compiling those into one list,\" Shradha said. \"I try to identify the words that seem likely to show up. If they're not spelled particularly the way they sound, then I'm like, 'OK, it's fair game,' and I study that.\"\n\nLearning as many words as possible isn't a foolproof approach. No one in the nearly century-long history of the bee has been able to memorize the more than 500,000 words in Webster's Unabridged dictionary, any of which can be selected for inclusion by Scripps' word panel of former bee champions, linguists and other experts.\n\nLast year's champion, Dev Shah, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that to become a champion speller, you must accept that you'll be asked a word you don't know -- and be calm enough to figure it out.\n\n\"The skill of guessing is everything,\" he wrote.\n\nAryan Khedkhar, a 13-year-old from Rochester Hills, Michigan, who finished tied for fifth last year, breaks down tricky words into categories.\n\n\"There are words with roots and words without roots that you just have to memorize. The ones that you have to memorize, I use language patterns. That really helps. If it doesn't have language patterns, I just try to use the simplest way possible,\" Aryan said. \"That's what the spelling bee is about. It's not about knowing as many words as you can.\"\n\nAditi Muthukumar said she tried to address her weaknesses on words derived from French or from the many languages of the Indian subcontinent. But the 13-year-old from Westminster, Colorado, expects she'll have to confront a word she doesn't know while competing in her final bee.\n\n\"I mean, probably,\" she said, \"and I hope I'll be OK with it.\"\n\nTEAM GHANA\n\nThis year's three spellers from Ghana showed up in a uniform -- black turtlenecks, white pants, shoes adorned with the Ghanian flag. The centerpiece: custom-designed jackets with sleeves made of woven kente fabric.\n\n\"We have to wear it,\" speller Abena Kwaffo said with a laugh.\n\nSpelling is an individual pursuit, but Team Ghana was unified by national pride. Ghana has sent a contingent of spellers for years, long enough that former competitor Darren Sackey is coaching this year's trio.\n\n\"It's teamwork. The spellers work very hard together,\" said Salome Dzakpasu, the Ghanian program director. \"Training together on weekends, on weekdays, sometimes evenings, learning how to combine schoolwork and preparing for the bee.\"\n\nWhile the past quarter-century of the bee has been dominated by the offspring of Indian immigrants, the only international champion was Jody-Anne Maxwell of Jamaica in 1998. Ghana's best finish was a tie for 18th by Afua Ansah in 2016.\n\nN'Dom Darko-Asare, a Ghanian seventh-grader competing for the third time, is more comfortable than ever.\n\n\"You may be scared of standing on stage. Once you've been there before, it doesn't really intimidate you as much,\" 13-year-old N'Dom said.\n\nVOCABULARY, DEFINED\n\nSpellers have been asked multiple-choice vocabulary questions onstage since 2021, and before that, vocabulary was part of a written test that determined which spellers made the semifinals.\n\nNonetheless, Scripps treated \"vocabulary\" like a dirty word, instead employing a euphemism: \"word meaning.\" That meant when introducing the vocabulary questions, pronouncers Jacques Bailly and the Rev. Brian Sietsema were forced to use the awkward construction, \"Your word meaning word is ...\"\n\nIn Tuesday's preliminary rounds, Sietsema handled pronunciation duties for the first batch of spellers. Those who spelled their first word correctly remained at the microphone while Sietsema told them, to cite one example, \"Your vocabulary word is 'terrarium.'\" (Jordin Oremosu, a 14-year-old speller from Florida, giggled with relief when she was asked to define that word.)\n\n\"There were discussions about it,\" Bailly said, adding though he wasn't responsible for the change, \"I always thought it should be 'vocabulary.'\"\n\n___\n\nBen Nuckols has covered the Scripps National Spelling Bee since 2012.

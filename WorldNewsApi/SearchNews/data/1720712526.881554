Dr Mosley had been with friends at Agios Nikolaos beach on Wednesday before going alone for a walk to the centre of the island. On May 25, he wrote his final ever social media post, which was a response to a fan who asked him if he'd ever heard the Dead Ringer's parody of himself. Dr Mosley replied: 'I have... I'm not convinced I really sound like that but my wife Clare says it is spot on.' One parody, included in Series 21, Episode 4 of Dead Ringers, mimicked Dr Mosley's voice and subject matter.

Mimi Spencer, who co-authored The Fast Diet with Dr Michael Mosley, also paid tribute to Dr Mosley as 'immediately likeable, genuinely funny' and said she will 'miss him terribly'. Read More Read Mail editor Ted Verity's tribute to 'unique' columnist Dr Michael Mosley Speaking on BBC Radio 4, she said: 'In person he was very much the sort of figure that you would see on television: immediately likeable, genuinely funny, enthusiastic, he had this innate enthusiasm about life and he was always very generous with his time. 'He had a brilliant line in tangential anecdote which comes out of his broadcasting as well, that his mind would go down rabbit holes and come out with fantastic snippets of information, and talking to him in person was much like that, you never quite knew where you were going to arrive, but the journey was always fascinating.' She said Mosley 'used himself as a human guinea pig', and said he was 'fascinated by the science of it'. Ms Spencer said she believes the 5:2 intermittent fasting plan and The Fast Diet gave him so much joy 'because it benefited so many people'. Ms Spencer added: 'Funnily enough in person, he could also be quite self-deprecating, and actually quite shy. So he never blew his trumpet, he was quite a humble person. 'I think when he had success, whether it was on the TV or through his books, he was rather thrown by it, he wasn't expecting it, and that speaks to the man really; that he kept that humility throughout.' The resort of Agia Marina, the location where Dr Mosley's body was found Police arrived at Agia Marina around 20 minutes after the body was discovered lying face up about 90 metres from the coastline. At around 2.09pm local time, firefighters arrived at the marina by boat and carried an orange stretcher and large black bag to where the body was found. Other people wearing plain clothes got off the white speed boat and took briefcases up the rocky hill. After around half an hour a party of six firefighters carefully gathered Dr Mosley's body and placed it onto the orange stretcher. It was then taken down to a jetty and loaded onto a small white tender and taken away to a mortuary on the island of Rhodes for a postmortem.

Just after 2pm local time the coroner's team arrived and wearing face masks they began to investigate examine the body and the scene around it. One could be seen taking pictures of the area and he occasionally paused to adjust the face mask he was wearing with his gloved hands. Minutes later a group of three rescuers also arrived carrying an orange plastic stretcher. At one point two of the coroner's party appeared to have picked up a rucksack which was separate from the body around 20ft away. It earlier emerged that Dr Mosley's grown-up children Alex, Jack, Dan and Kate were just 350ft away from where the body was found when they retraced their father's steps yesterday. It appeared the Mail columnist had walked around the perimeter of the beach bar at Agia Marina and was heading towards the sea. Temperatures at the time were around 37c and though he had a bottle of water with him the heat would have made it incredibly difficult. It appeared that he may have been trying to reach the sea as his body was just a few feet from the shore. A source said the distinctive umbrella he had been carrying at the time was close to him. At the time of his disappearance there was an excessive heat warning from the Greek Meteorological office, with temperatures predicted to hit a blistering 38c - unusual for early June.

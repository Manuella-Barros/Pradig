He was also named Man of the Series in the 1996 ICC ODI World Cup.\n\nSri Lanka have added Kusal Perera and Avishka Fernando, who missed the World Cup, to their squad. They've also selected uncapped all-rounder Chamindu Wickramasinghe, following his strong performances in the Lanka Premier League (LPL).\n\nSri Lanka's chief selector, Upul Tharanga, announced that Dushmantha Chameera will miss the Twenty20 and the one-day international series against India due to injury. Asitha Fernando is likely to replace Chameera in the Sri Lanka squad.\n\nFollowing the T20I series, India and Sri Lanka will compete in a three-match ODI series. The first match will be played at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Friday, August 2. The remaining two matches are scheduled at the same venue on August 4 and August 6, respectively.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanath_Jayasuriya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanath Jayasuriya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avishka_Fernando", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avishka Fernando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusal_Perera", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kusal Perera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sportstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallekele", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pallekele"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pallekele"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanindu_Hasaranga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wanindu Hasaranga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cricket_team_in_the_West_Indies_in_2016", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian cricket team in the West Indies in 2016"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asitha_Fernando", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asitha Fernando"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upul_Tharanga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upul Tharanga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Premadasa_International_Cricket_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R.

People have a deep love for cricket\" the Sports Minister had said.\n\nJayasuriya also stressed that Sri Lanka should get the best advantage from the absence of three experienced players; Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and allrounder Ravindra Jadeja, who have announced their retirement from the shorter format after T20 World Cup last month.\n\n\"They are not in the team, which is a loss to the Indian team, and we should take maximum advantage of it ,'' he said. \"Rohit, Virat and Jadeja are the best players in the world.

People have a deep love for cricket\" the Sports Minister had said.\n\nJayasuriya also stressed that Sri Lanka should get the best advantage from the absence of three experienced players; Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and allrounder Ravindra Jadeja, who have announced their retirement from the shorter format after T20 World Cup last month.\n\n\"They are not in the team, which is a loss to the Indian team, and we should take maximum advantage of it ,'' he said. \"Rohit, Virat and Jadeja are the best players in the world. With their talent, the cricket they played, we all know where they stand,\" Jayasuirya said.\n\nThe three T20Is will be played on July 27, 28 and 30 at Pallekele International Stadium followed by three ODIs, starting from August 2 in Colombo.", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanath_Jayasuriya", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanath Jayasuriya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_England_and_Ireland_in_2016", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in England and Ireland in 2016"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colombo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sri Lanka"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/ICC", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Science", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 48}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=Jayasuriya+disciplines+SL+cricketers+ahead+of+T2OI+series+against+India", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759102", "eventUri": "eng-9759102", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 9, "textEnd": 16}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 2258, "textEnd": 2266}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

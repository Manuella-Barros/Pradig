{"id": 231237856, "title": "\"Counsel Culture\" makes us wonder, is Nick Cannon really the best advocate for growth and healing?", "text": "Not taking Nick Cannon seriously is an involuntary reflex for some of us. We have our reasons. Maybe it's because he\u2019s a professional talent competition emcee, hosting shows like \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d and \u201cThe Masked Singer\u201d \u2013 a job that requires charisma but not necessarily intellectual agility or depth. He\u2019s also fathered 12 children with six different women over the last 15 years, ensuring regular tabloid exposure and mentions in stand-up routines. And the host and creator of MTV\u2019s \u201cWild \u2018N Out\u201d has said his share of, um, wild things over the years. One almost cost him that show in 2020, when he made antisemitic remarks on his podcast \u201cCannon\u2019s Class.\u201d The series\u2019 then-parent company ViacomCBS temporarily severed ties with him in the direct wake of that incident, only to plug him back in once Cannon \u201cdid the work,\u201d as they call it in self-help circles. So you can\u2019t blame people for looking at his new series \u201cCounsel Culture\u201d with all the side-eye in the known universe. Where to begin? There\u2019s the title and motto Cannon repeats in each episode \u2013 that \u201cit\u2019s not about cancel culture, it\u2019s about counsel culture.\u201d This invokes a concept that Cannon has proven several times doesn\u2019t really exist along with establishing the show\u2019s connection to the medium\u2019s fraught melding of psychotherapy and entertainment. Cannon referenced supposed cultural cancellation during a 2020 Variety virtual roundtable with editor-at-large Kate Aurthur in response to the firing of \u201cVanderpump Rules\u201d cast members Stassi Schroeder and Kristen Doute. \u201cI think we should shift the idea of cancel culture to counsel culture because we all have a past,\u201d he said. \u201cClearly we\u2019re living in a very systemic infrastructure where everyone's guilty . . . So in that, let's figure out how to fix that one individual at a time, and use these times when people may say something incorrectly or out of ignorance and educate.\u201d If only he hadn\u2019t promoted an antisemitic trope accusing Jewish people of controlling centralized banking, among other statements, on an episode of his podcast \u201cCannon\u2019s Class\u201d that surfaced a month after saying that. Once his TV studio overlords threatened to send Cannon down the road of unemployment, he negotiated a detour through what he refers to as a journey of atonement in an interview featured in a 2021 episode of ABC\u2019s \u201cSoul of a Nation.\u201d I realize how sardonic this reads about a man who, by all accounts, did much more than simply pay the standard forgiveness tax to a Jewish organization on top of issuing a perfunctory apology along with assurances about listening, meditation and other typical means of public mea culpa-ing to get it over with. That comes with the territory of dealing with multihyphenates with a massive platform and the influence that comes with it Cannon has been a fixture among Millennials since his Nickelodeon debut on \u201cAll That\u201d led to him fronting a self-titled spinoff, \u201cThe Nick Cannon Show.\u201d He\u2019s also a hip-hop performer and movie actor. The remarks that got him in hot water threatened his ability to continue with his most lasting success, the MTV show he also created and produced that\u2019s been on since 2005, save for a six-year hiatus between 2007 and 2013. All of which is to say, he has a financial stake in representing himself as someone who made a huge mistake, held himself accountable and demonstrated growth. From what he\u2019s said in the podcast that inspired his TV show, he tried to do that \u2014 at least on some fronts. In a recent podcast conversation with inspirational speaker and life coach Iyanla Vanzant, who hosted \u201cIyanla: Fix My Life\u201d from 2012 to 2021 on OWN, Cannon said he\u2019s in counseling three or four times a week on top of managing his career \u2014 and somehow making time to keep up with his expansive family. What he\u2019s taken from that experience informs the tone and approach of his Amazon series, where a roundtable of \u201ccounsel men\u201d delves into conversations ranging from discussions about anxiety, depression, body image, modern dating and (of course!) fatherhood. Joining Cannon\u2019s regular presence is Dr. Ish Major \u2013 who is a board-certified psychiatrist on top of being a TV personality, which is more than Dr. Phil McGraw can claim \u2013 and bestselling author and psychotherapist and bestselling author Dr. Mike Dow. Howie Mandel in \"Counsel Culture\" (Prime Video)Otherwise, Cannon fills the rest of the seats at the table with his fellow comedians like Howie Mandel and Tim Chantarangsu and other public figures known for their mental health expertise, including Yolo Akili Robinson and John Kim. He\u2019s also joined stars whose struggles were also chronicled in tabloid pages, including former NBA star Lamar Odom and Ray J (both of whom also happen to be Kardashian-adjacent) and other TV personalities in the advice-dispensing business. The show is billed as a safe space to explore issues of men\u2019s vulnerability, although many of the audience members happen to be young, attractive women. That also makes it an extension of Cannon\u2019s mindscape, including his moments of self-examination and his frailties. That\u2019s not necessarily to its detriment. Since \u201cCounsel Culture\u201d devotes itself to showing its creator\u2019s serious side, he doesn\u2019t shy away from taking its medicine in front of the cameras. Cannon\u2019s son Zen died from brain cancer at 5 months old in 2021, one of the inspirations for his \u201cUnderstanding Grief\u201d episode. But when he quietly begins to cry while the panel discusses loss, you can tell it\u2019s unplanned. Not many celebrities grieve openly unless the space is orchestrated for it, even on shows like this. And the producers could have kept his expression out of the final cut, allowing the host to regain his composure. Instead, a fellow panelist calls attention to his tears and invites Cannon to share what he\u2019s going through. He does, until he says, \u201cI\u2019m not going to sit here and cry my eyes out.\u201d \u201cBut if you did,\u201d Major tells him, \u201cit would be OK.\u201d When considering its place in the larger TV therapy landscape, \u201cCounsel Culture\u201d leaves me conflicted. Cannon has that baggage we\u2019ve mentioned and others he hasn\u2019t had to answer for, like his characterization of Planned Parenthood\u2019s mission as \u201cpopulation control\u201d and \u201cmodern-day eugenics\u201d on a 2016 broadcast of \"The Breakfast Club\" radio series. His newest series is grounded in the notion that people can change, which he considers solemnly. Even so, in May, a podcast episode of \u201cCounsel Culture\u201d featured a conversation with Dr. Umar Johnson, a pan-Africanist who is against interracial marriage and homosexuality, sharing his views on polygamy. For many viewers, watching shows centered on mental health is, in its way, their version of therapy. And some mental health professionals featured on such series operate with care, considering that knowledge. But it\u2019s always a slippery proposition to make entertainers like Cannon the face of growth and psychological wellness. The examples provided by Dr. Drew Pinsky and McGraw let us know how perilous it can be to mix psychological wellness and celebrity culture. The legacy of the syndicated \u201cDr. Phil\u201d is one of cheapening the process for shock value. When he ended his show last year after 21 seasons it still averaged around 2 million viewers per episode. Along the way he also collected a trail of lawsuits, a publicized beef with Britney Spears\u2019 family, and a flirtation with COVID denial, to name a few reasons to be glad he\u2019s disappeared from major broadcast platforms. (But not entirely; this week he announced an interview with Donald Trump on a nascent Internet streaming service, preaching, among other nonsense, the necessity to forgive the convicted fraudster who has promised to use his office to take vengeance on his enemies if he\u2019s re-elected president.)

Cannon wisely doesn\u2019t position himself as an expert, although he\u2019s said that he\u2019s pursuing his master\u2019s degree in psychology. Instead, he acts as a facilitator, leaving the bulk of the analysis and advice to his (TV-branded) experts. Lamar Odom in \"Counsel Culture\" (Prime Video)And his approach is relatively responsible. This isn\u2019t just my observation \u2013 I watched a few episodes with my husband, a practicing psychologist with more than two decades of experience as a mental health professional. He likened the \u201cCounsel Culture\u201d setup to the broadly recognizable format of ESPN\u2019s \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d which is a compliment, not a critique. If the goal is to destigmatize psychological health concerns among young men, mimicking a casual sports show without the hype and minimizing applause during sensitive insights, isn\u2019t the worst approach. In fact, the \u201cFox NFL Sunday\u201d panel thrives on its openness concerning the co-hosts' mental health struggles. An episode of the late great HBO series \u201cReal Sports with Bryant Gumbel\u201d explored that side of the show as a public service asset. \u201cCounsel Culture\u201d has a long distance to travel before we can begin to consider it as a peer in that space. It might not make it beyond the few episodes streaming this week or substantially change how or what we think of Cannon. But at the very least it gives us something new and perhaps even valuable to talk about the next time his name enters the chat for whatever reason, and for whatever that\u2019s worth. \"Counsel Culture\" is streaming on Prime Video.", "summary": "Extending his podcast into a streaming series, the TV host is inviting us to participate in his atonement journey", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2024/06/07/counsel-culture-nick-cannon-prime-video-review/", "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/06/counsel_culture_still_01.jpg ?>", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:14:36", "author": "Melanie McFarland", "authors": ["Melanie McFarland"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.121}

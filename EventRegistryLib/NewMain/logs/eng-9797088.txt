The charges relate to breaches of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code during the 2024 Kabul Premier League.\n\nInsanullah Janat, a prominent top-order batter for Afghanistan, has been banned from all cricket-related activities for five years due to corruption charges, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) announced on Wednesday. The ban, effective immediately, stems from breaches of both ACB and ICC anti-corruption codes during the second edition of the Kabul Premier League earlier this year.\n\nThe ACB's statement highlighted Janat's violation of Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code, which addresses improper influence or efforts to manipulate the outcome, progress, conduct, or any other aspect of a match. 'Janat was found guilty of violating Article 2.1.1 of the ICC Anti-Corruption Code, which involves improper influence or efforts to fix the result, progress, conduct, or any other aspect of a match,' the Board stated, as quoted by ESPNCricinfo.\n\nThe Board further added, 'In light of this violation, he has been handed a five-year ban from all cricket-related activities. Janat has admitted to the charges and confessed to his involvement in corrupt activities.' Additionally, the ACB is investigating three other players for potential involvement in similar corrupt activities, with decisions pending based on the confirmation of their guilt.\n\nDuring the Kabul Premier League 2024, Janat represented the Shamshad Eagles, scoring 72 runs in four innings at an average of 18 and a strike rate of 150. The team finished at the bottom of the six-team league, securing just one win from five games. On the international stage, Janat has played in 20 matches for Afghanistan across all formats since his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in February 2017, accumulating 307 runs in 16 ODIs at an average of 21.92. He has also featured in three Tests, scoring 110 runs at an average of 22.00, and one T20I, where he scored a 14-ball 20 in June 2022 against Zimbabwe in Harare, marking his last appearance for the national team.\n\nJanat hails from a cricketing family, with his brother Nawroz Mangal being a key figure in Afghanistan's early years of international cricket. Nawroz captained the national team when they achieved ODI status at the 2009 World Cup qualifiers and again during their qualification for the 2010 T20 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan_Cricket_Board", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan Cricket Board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kabul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPNcricinfo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPNcricinfo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawroz_Mangal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nawroz Mangal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harare"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/07_08_2024_13_51_17_7220291.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797088", "eventUri": "eng-9797088", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-02-", "textStart": 1915, "textEnd": 1928}], "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Ihsanullah Janat over corruption", "body": "Afghanistan's cricket board said on Wednesday it had banned former top-order international batter Ihsanullah Janat for five years after he admitted to \"corrupt activities\" in a domestic league.\n\nThree other unidentified players were also under investigation over match-fixing, the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said.\n\nJanat, 26, the younger brother of former Afghan skipper and selector Nawroz Mangal, was regarded as a talented player with three Tests, 16 one-day internationals and one Twenty20 international under his belt.\n\n\"Janat has been banned from all forms of cricketing activities for five years following breaches of ACB and ICC (International Cricket Council) Anti-Corruption Codes during the second edition of the Kabul Premier League 2024,\" the ACB said in a statement\n\n\"Janat has admitted to the charges and confessed to his involvement in corrupt activities,\" it said.\n\nJanat scored 72 runs in four innings for the Shamshad Eagles, who finished sixth and last this year in the Kabul League, which was launched in 2022.\n\nThe ban on Janat, who last played for the national team in 2022, takes effect immediately, the ACB said.\n\nFormer Afghan national player Shafiqullah Shafaq was banned from cricket for six years over corrupt practices in 2020.\n\nAfghanistan have progressed rapidly at the international level, beating former champions England, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the ODI World Cup last year.\n\nTheir highest point came in the Twenty20 World Cup in June when they beat Australia and New Zealand on their way to the semi-finals.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

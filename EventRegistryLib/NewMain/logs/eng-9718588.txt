Also present was Galway GAA chaplain Fr Pat Farragher.\n\nCrowds packed into the cathedral long before the celebration of life began and Mass opened with a haunting rendition of 'The West Awake,' which was highly-appropriate for a man who had guided Mayo, Leitrim and Galway to eight Connacht football titles and Galway to two All-Ireland titles.\n\nSymbols of John's life presented by his grandchildren included the football jersey he wore when Mayo won the All-Ireland minor final in 1971, alongside Ballaghaderreen and St Nathy's jerseys, a geography book to mark his many years as a teacher, the Oireachtas pin from his first day in the D\u00e1il in 2007, a family picture and a crucifix blessed by Pope Francis.\n\nFr Dan O'Mahony welcomed everyone and said while hearts were heavy and it was hard to comprehend his brother would no longer be present in body, everyone was extremely thankful for having 71 wonderful years with John.\n\nIn a heartfelt homily, Fr Stephen, said his late brother was a man of faith who had gone out to the world and proclaimed the good news in his own inimitable way. \"He spent his life doing this - not from a pulpit but by the way he lived. He treated everyone with great respect. Pauper and prince got the same billing,\" the priest stated.\n\nLater, in an extremely well-delivered eulogy, Deirdre, one of five daughters of John and Gerardine O'Mahony, gave the congregation an insight into her father. \"If he was here he would tell me 'they won't remember what you say - they'll remember how you made them feel.'\n\nShe explained how he lived a life embedded in \"love, loyalty, empathy and community,\" and explained how her father would have both loved and hated all the fuss there has been since he passed away over the weekend.\n\n\"He never made anything about himself, so he'd have hated all the fuss, but he'd have loved it too - meeting all the people who shaped his life and meant so much to him.\"\n\nShe went on to speak about her father's love of potential and his determination to develop the person, not just the footballer.\n\n\"So many people have come to us over the past few days and told us about his impact on their lives. It seems he was training people not just for exams or the pitch, but for life with his concentration on integrity, loyalty and positivity.\"\n\nDeirdre went on to speak about the incredible bond her parents had and recounted the words her father used to describe her mother, Gerardine, the love of his life.\n\n\"He would say, when times were good she's behind you and when times are tough she's out in front fighting for you.\"", "source": {"uri": "mayonews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mayo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gallagher_michael@mayonews.ie", "name": "Gallagher Michael", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Mahony_(Mayo_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John O'Mahony (Mayo politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballaghaderreen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ballaghaderreen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ballaghaderreen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galway", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Galway"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Mayo", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "County Mayo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "County Mayo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitrim_GAA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leitrim GAA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_(liturgy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mass (liturgy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael D.

Stephen, one of John's two brothers, said his success in football and politics was not due to chance but to a fiercely competitive spirit which he had displayed since childhood.\n\nAs well as winning numerous accolades as a GAA player and inter-county manager, John, a native of Magheraboy, Kilmovee, served with distinction as a public representative at the highest level.\n\nHe was a TD for the Mayo constituency from 2007 to 2016 and subsequently served as a Senator from 2016 to 2020.\n\nFr. Stephen, one of the con-celebrants of the Requiem Mass, said John \"believed the difference between success and failure was down to inches\" and \"he would do whatever it takes to win.\"\n\nHe went on to say that success had not changed his brother - despite his public face - in any way.\n\n\"He loved a challenge, he loved bringing potential to fruition,\" continued Fr. Stephen..\n\nA diagnosis of serious illness four years ago was but another challenge, a challenge to be tackled.\n\nSince the diagnosis, John, apart from necessary medical treatment, had practically lived a normal life.\n\nAny failures or difficulties in life were a chance to pick himself up, dust himself off, try again to do better.\n\nThe main celebrant of the Funeral Mass was John's older brother, Fr. Dan.\n\nConcelebrants included Fr. Stephen, John's brother-in-law Fr. Tommy Towey, and one of John's close friends, Fr. Pat Donnellan.\n\nFr. Dan said family hearts were heavy since John's death on Saturday last as they faced the reality he was no longer with them in body but was there in spirit.\n\n\"He lived such a full life right to the very end,\" Fr. Dan recalled.\n\nAn Taoiseach Simon Harris attended today's funeral as well as GAA President Jarlath Burns.\n\nPresident Michael D. Higgins was represented by his aide-de-camp, Captain Paul O'Donnell.\n\nThe chief mourners were John's widow, Gerardine, their daughters Grainne, Niamh, Rhona, Deirdre and Cliodhna and their families.\n\nJohn and Gerardine have eleven grandchildren.\n\nTom Shiel Published: Thu 11 Jul 2024, 4:08 PM Last updated: Thu 11 Jul 2024, 4:09 PM", "source": {"uri": "con-telegraph.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Connaught Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Mahony_(Mayo_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John O'Mahony (Mayo politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Requiem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Annunciation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballaghaderreen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballaghaderreen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ballaghaderreen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayo_(D\u00e1il_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayo (D\u00e1il constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(Gaelic_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (Gaelic games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seanad_\u00c9ireann", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seanad \u00c9ireann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teachta_D\u00e1la", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teachta D\u00e1la"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilmovee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kilmovee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kilmovee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarlath_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarlath Burns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Gaelic_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "President of the Gaelic Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Donnellan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Donnellan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael D.

He passed away at the weekend following an illness.\n\nHe guided Galway to All-Ireland titles in 1998 and 2001. He managed his native Mayo on two occasions, from 1987-91 and 2006-10. He also led Leitrim to a Connacht title in 1994. He served as a teacher in St Nathy's in Ballagaderreen.\n\nAfter the service, his coffin was draped in a flag featuring the GAA crest, along with those of Leitrim, Galway, Mayo and Ballaghaderreen.\n\nJohn's brothers Fr Dan and Fr Stephen concelebrated the Mass with John's wife Geraldine's brother Fr Tommy Towey among the celebrants.\n\nThe Taoiseach Simon Harris and Captain Paul O'Donnell, representing President Michael D Higgins, were present along with the GAA President Jarlath Burns.\n\nFr Stephen in his homily spoke of his immense pride at being known as John O'Mahony's brother. He spoke of John's faith, how he treated everyone the same, and the competitor he was.\n\n\"He respected life and the lives of the many people he came in contact with, whether for a brief moment or for those who are part of the fabric of his life.\n\n\"Pauper and Prince got the same respect and with that attitude he was a life giver.\n\n\"He treated people as people, not just as a student, as a footballer, as a background team member, as a canvasser, as a constituent or as a politician.\n\n\"And many stories have been told over the last few days of people and ways in which he had helped, help he had always gave freely and willingly to support anyone who needed it.\n\n\"It was allied to a fiercely competitive spirit.\"\n\nFr Stephen recounted a funny episode from their childhood.\n\n\"I'm sure you all know who's a Halloween brack is. Myself and John were at home and we had the brack and of course the competition, for John anyway, was to get the ring.\n\n\"I was took a nice slice and no luck but John was into doorsteps and if he didn't get through the first one he'd figure out where that he had the next turn as well.\n\n\"But I only recount that because it's underlines that competitive spirit that he would do anything it takes to win.\n\n\"And that attitude was taken into all aspects of his life whether it be as a teacher, as a football coach or as a politician.\n\n\"He would do whatever it took to win.\n\n\"And that famously I suppose, as many people will know, meant attention to detail, where he often talked about the difference between success and failure came down to inches. Everything was important in achieving the goal.\"\n\nThe famous Leitrim Connacht final win over his own Mayo took meticulous planning.\n\n\"Before the Connacht final in 1994 he had arranged for a meal in a secluded hotel near Hyde Park in Roscommon. He was worried that the gate of the hotel wouldn't be wide enough for the team bus and he drove up to Roscommon to measure if there was an inch to spare.\n\n\"And I suppose that sums him up in many ways.\"\n\nBut of the many great teams John O'Mahony was part of, one always took priority,.\n\n\"I have no doubt in my mind that the greatest team he was part of was team O'Mahony Towey based in Tower House because as I say he was a team player and together with Geraldine they formed formidable team.\"\n\nJohn's daughter Deirdre gave a eulogy after communion. She spoke about her father's love for where he came from and his deep sense of community and love for his family.\n\n\"Everything about Johnno ran deep, especially his sense of place and community. He grew up out the road in Magheraboy, his father was a proud Cork man and his mother a gentle woman from Erris. And theirs was the last house before the border.\n\n\"When we were small he showed us a small stream a few yards away from the house dividing Mayo and Roscommon, and although you'd hardly notice it, he said that when he was growing up it may as well have been a 10 foot wall.\n\n\"And that fuelled his passion for football. He said rivalry was the heartbeat of the GAA and pumps ever more furiously the closer you get to the border.\n\n\"Johnno faced lots of challenges at home. it wasn't easy living with six women and John and Ger would have a triage system for when things would go wrong. You would go through Ger first and if it was serious enough it would be escalated to the boss.\n\n\"It mostly worked well, he gave great advice, sometimes offers of intervention but above all he gave you that feeling that you would get through it and he always had your back.\n\n\"He'd often say when the five of us would turn on each other there are plenty of people out there who are willing to tear you down but in here we had to stick together and we had to have each other's backs. He applied that to his teams as well, loyalty to each other and to the team was all important, no place for fancy dans.\n\n\"He loved his home place and the places that adopted him, especially Ballagadereen. He was technically a blow-in but Ballagadereen and St Nathy's through and through. Green and white running through his veins even as he wore other colours on the outside.\n\n\"He loved his friends, his Monday night card games which I think came as close to religion as anything ever did.\n\n\"He loved the sun although he didn't have a great relationship with airplanes.\n\n\"The late P\u00e1id\u00ed \u00d3 S\u00e9 once tried to help him with that. On the way back from an All Stars tour where he prescribed something to help dad get over the flight.

{"id": 225043820, "title": "Martin Freeman is back in the best, most intense police drama in years", "text": "The Responder\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605SBS, Thursdays, 9.50pm Martin Freeman returns for a second season of one of the best, most intense police dramas in years. Two years ago, we met his Chris Carson, a hardened Liverpool copper working nights in Urgent Response, dealing with an incessant carousel of addicts, the mentally ill, the homeless and the lonely. Created and written by former police officer Tony Schumacher, The Responder is again as much about civilian life as it is a depiction of copper life in an underfunded police force. A series of dodgy goings-on last season saw Chris tangled up in the murder of a local drug dealer, Carl (Ian Hart), and the weight of that, coupled with his troubled marriage (to MyAnna Buring\u2019s Kate), his mother dying (Rita Tushingham) and unprocessed childhood trauma from his violent father (Bernard Hill), were all crushing him. It was a surprise he didn\u2019t have a stroke by the third episode. I thought I might have one myself watching Freeman\u2019s incredible portrayal of a bewildered, raging man on the edge (Freeman won an International Best Actor Emmy for the role last year). This season, Chris and Kate have separated, his mum has died, he\u2019s trying his best at a men\u2019s support group, and living in a shitty flat his daughter Tilly (Romi Hyland-Rylands) tells him \u201csmells like kebabs\u201d.

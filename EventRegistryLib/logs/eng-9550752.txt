With the debut of their new arena, the Intuit Dome, Clippers owner Steve Ballmer is poised to infuse the team with new energy and a revitalized spirit. This isn't just a change of venue -- it's potentially a whole new era for the franchise. Despite the star-studded roster with Kawhi Leonard and Paul George at the helm, who had underachieved so far together, the Clippers' recent performance has been lackluster, stained by repeated playoff disappointments even as they added James Harden this season. Over the past five years, their playoff journey has included two first-round exits, a second-round departure, a Western Conference Finals loss, and a season missing the playoffs entirely.\n\nAt 32, Kawhi Leonard's career has been plagued by injuries, raising concerns about his long-term viability as a franchise cornerstone. Paul George, similarly injury-prone, has faced criticisms of being overrated, especially when the stakes are high. James Harden, once a dominant force in the league, appears to have his best years behind him. With these factors in mind, the Clippers stand at a crossroads, contemplating a future that could pivot away from their current stars to embrace a dynamic, energetic team characterized by high flyers and staunch defenders. This new direction could not only redefine the team's identity but also perfectly complement the fresh start promised by the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Clippers Send Kawhi Leonard To The Warriors\n\nAs the Clippers look to shake things up and move past a stretch marked by injuries in the playoffs, trading Kawhi Leonard could be a smart move. His time with the team, though speckled with stellar performances, was often overshadowed by his struggle to stay healthy during the key postseason moments. This could tempt a team like the Golden State Warriors, hungry to get back to the playoffs, to take a chance on Leonard's superstar abilities.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Receive: Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Gary Payton II, 2026 First-Round Pick, 2028 First-Round Pick\n\nGolden State Warriors Receive: Kawhi Leonard\n\nThe Warriors are keen to bounce back strong, and snagging Leonard could be their big play. He brings that clutch factor and defensive grit they've been missing.\n\nFor the Clippers, this deal would hit the reset button and bring in some fresh legs. Jonathan Kuminga is a promising young talent who averaged 16.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game last season, showing flashes of brilliance and a lot of potential. Andrew Wiggins, chipping in with 13.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, would add some solid scoring and dependable defense. Throw in Gary Payton II for his fierce defense and hustle, and this lineup starts looking pretty spicy. Not to mention, those two future first-round picks could really help the Clippers build a strong team for the years ahead.\n\nKawhi Leonard, despite the ups and downs, was a key player for the Clippers when he was on the floor. In the 2023-24 season, he managed to put up 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game across 68 games. His ability to change the game when he's playing is undeniable.\n\nThis trade would not just give the Clippers some exciting new players and valuable draft picks, but also a chance to craft a new identity that's all about vibrancy and defensive smarts. It's a chance to build something that could stand the test of an ever-evolving NBA landscape.\n\nPaul George Returns To The Pacers\n\nPaul George has a big decision to make: pick up his $48 million player option with the Clippers for this season or opt for a sign-and-trade that could secure him a larger salary than hitting the free agency market directly. Either way, it looks like a return to the Indiana Pacers could be on the cards for George via a trade.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Receive: Bennedict Mathurin, Aaron Nesmith, Doug McDermott, 2027 First-Round Pick, 2029 First-Round Pick\n\nIndiana Pacers Receive: Paul George\n\nFor the Clippers, this deal could be a win. Here's why: They'd be getting a fresh young talent in Bennedict Mathurin, who put up 14.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game last season. Aaron Nesmith isn't too shabby either, contributing 12.2 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Doug McDermott, known for his sharpshooting, would bring experienced depth to the squad. Plus, snagging two future first-round picks gives the Clippers valuable assets to either rebuild or trade for more immediate help.\n\nMoving Paul George might seem bold, but it could make sense for the Clippers. They get younger, add depth, and secure draft assets that could set them up for the future. As for George, his stats last season -- 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game -- show he's still a force on the court.\n\nIn Indiana, George's arrival would be huge. Teaming up with Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam, who are leading the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, could push the team to the next level. George's experience and scoring ability would complement Haliburton's playmaking and Siakam's versatility, creating a dynamic trio capable of contending in the East.\n\nThis trade isn't just about nostalgia; it's about strategic fit. George knows the Pacers, the city, and some of the management. His return could be the spark Indiana needs to go from a semi-final team to a genuine title contender. For the Clippers, it's about reshaping a team that needs to get younger and more flexible financially while still staying competitive. It's a bold move, but one that could benefit both sides immensely.\n\nJames Harden Sign-And-Trade To The Heat\n\nJames Harden's time with the Clippers seems to be nearing an end. After a disappointing finish in the first round of the playoffs, the Clippers could be looking to move Harden as part of a broader youth-focused rebuild.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Receive: Tyler Herro\n\nMiami Heat Receive: James Harden, Bones Hyland\n\nThis deal seems like a win-win for both teams. The Clippers land Tyler Herro, a young sharpshooter who could quickly become the new face of the franchise. Herro averaged 20.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game last season, showcasing his scoring ability and playmaking skills. His youth and potential make him an ideal centerpiece for the Clippers' retooling efforts.\n\nThe Miami Heat, in need of a true point guard and always keen to shake things up, would receive James Harden, whose playmaking and scoring would be a huge boost. Last season, Harden put up 16.6 points, 8.5 assists, and 5.1 rebounds per game. He could be the perfect partner for Bam Adebayo in pick-and-roll situations and help relieve Jimmy Butler of some playmaking duties, allowing Butler to focus more on scoring.\n\nAdditionally, the Heat would get Bones Hyland, a promising young guard known for his energy and scoring off the bench. Hyland's versatility and potential to grow could make him a valuable asset for Miami as they continue to contend in the Eastern Conference.\n\nFor the Clippers, acquiring Herro represents a strategic move towards youth and scoring prowess, keeping the team competitive while also building for the future. Meanwhile, the Heat would solidify their backcourt and enhance their championship aspirations by adding a seasoned veteran like Harden, known for his ability to take over games and his playoff experience. This trade could reshape both teams, giving them what they need to tackle their respective challenges in the coming seasons.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers Should Let Go Of Russell Westbrook\n\nAs the Los Angeles Clippers assess their roster moving forward, it's becoming evident that Russell Westbrook may not be the right fit. Despite his stellar regular-season contributions, Westbrook's performance in the postseason left much to be desired, raising questions about his compatibility with the team's young core. With reports circulating about Westbrook seeking opportunities elsewhere, it's clear that a change is imminent.\n\nFor the Clippers, parting ways with Westbrook could open up avenues for younger talent to flourish and for the team to explore different play styles. Westbrook's $4 million Player Option could be better utilized elsewhere if he rejects it and enters free agency, especially if the Clippers aim to bolster their roster with players who better complement their emerging stars.\n\nAs Westbrook hits free agency, teams like the New Orleans Pelicans or a return to Oklahoma City Thunder could provide him with the opportunity he seeks, even if it means accepting a half MLE deal in the range of $7-8 million per season. It's a move that could benefit both Westbrook and the Clippers as they chart their respective paths forward.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles Clippers Believe Kawhi Leonard Needs \"Elite Team\" To Offset Injuries\n\nYoung Clippers Debut In Intuit Dome\n\nStarting Lineup: Tyler Herro, Bennedict Mathurin, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Ivica Zubac\n\nBench: Terance Mann, Aaron Nesmith, Norman Powell, Gary Payton II, Amir Coffey, Robert Covington, Goga Bitadze\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are gearing up for an exciting season at the Intuit Dome with a young and dynamic lineup.

Over the past five years, their playoff journey has included two first-round exits, a second-round departure, a Western Conference Finals loss, and a season missing the playoffs entirely.\n\nAt 32, Kawhi Leonard's career has been plagued by injuries, raising concerns about his long-term viability as a franchise cornerstone. Paul George, similarly injury-prone, has faced criticisms of being overrated, especially when the stakes are high. James Harden, once a dominant force in the league, appears to have his best years behind him. With these factors in mind, the Clippers stand at a crossroads, contemplating a future that could pivot away from their current stars to embrace a dynamic, energetic team characterized by high flyers and staunch defenders. This new direction could not only redefine the team's identity but also perfectly complement the fresh start promised by the Intuit Dome.\n\nThe Clippers Send Kawhi Leonard To The Warriors\n\nAs the Clippers look to shake things up and move past a stretch marked by injuries in the playoffs, trading Kawhi Leonard could be a smart move. His time with the team, though speckled with stellar performances, was often overshadowed by his struggle to stay healthy during the key postseason moments. This could tempt a team like the Golden State Warriors, hungry to get back to the playoffs, to take a chance on Leonard's superstar abilities.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Receive: Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Gary Payton II, 2026 First-Round Pick, 2028 First-Round Pick\n\nGolden State Warriors Receive: Kawhi Leonard\n\nThe Warriors are keen to bounce back strong, and snagging Leonard could be their big play. He brings that clutch factor and defensive grit they've been missing.\n\nFor the Clippers, this deal would hit the reset button and bring in some fresh legs. Jonathan Kuminga is a promising young talent who averaged 16.1 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists per game last season, showing flashes of brilliance and a lot of potential. Andrew Wiggins, chipping in with 13.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, would add some solid scoring and dependable defense. Throw in Gary Payton II for his fierce defense and hustle, and this lineup starts looking pretty spicy. Not to mention, those two future first-round picks could really help the Clippers build a strong team for the years ahead.\n\nKawhi Leonard, despite the ups and downs, was a key player for the Clippers when he was on the floor. In the 2023-24 season, he managed to put up 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, and 3.6 assists per game across 68 games. His ability to change the game when he's playing is undeniable.\n\nThis trade would not just give the Clippers some exciting new players and valuable draft picks, but also a chance to craft a new identity that's all about vibrancy and defensive smarts. It's a chance to build something that could stand the test of an ever-evolving NBA landscape.\n\nPaul George Returns To The Pacers\n\nPaul George has a big decision to make: pick up his $48 million player option with the Clippers for this season or opt for a sign-and-trade that could secure him a larger salary than hitting the free agency market directly. Either way, it looks like a return to the Indiana Pacers could be on the cards for George via a trade.\n\nLos Angeles Clippers Receive: Bennedict Mathurin, Aaron Nesmith, Doug McDermott, 2027 First-Round Pick, 2029 First-Round Pick\n\nIndiana Pacers Receive: Paul George\n\nFor the Clippers, this deal could be a win. Here's why: They'd be getting a fresh young talent in Bennedict Mathurin, who put up 14.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game last season. Aaron Nesmith isn't too shabby either, contributing 12.2 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Doug McDermott, known for his sharpshooting, would bring experienced depth to the squad. Plus, snagging two future first-round picks gives the Clippers valuable assets to either rebuild or trade for more immediate help.\n\nMoving Paul George might seem bold, but it could make sense for the Clippers. They get younger, add depth, and secure draft assets that could set them up for the future. As for George, his stats last season -- 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game -- show he's still a force on the court.\n\nIn Indiana, George's arrival would be huge. Teaming up with Tyrese Haliburton and Pascal Siakam, who are leading the Pacers in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, could push the team to the next level. George's experience and scoring ability would complement Haliburton's playmaking and Siakam's versatility, creating a dynamic trio capable of contending in the East.\n\nThis trade isn't just about nostalgia; it's about strategic fit. George knows the Pacers, the city, and some of the management. His return could be the spark Indiana needs to go from a semi-final team to a genuine title contender. For the Clippers, it's about reshaping a team that needs to get younger and more flexible financially while still staying competitive. It's a bold move, but one that could benefit both sides immensely.\n\nJames Harden Sign-And-Trade To The Heat\n\nJames Harden's time with the Clippers seems to be nearing an end. After a disappointing finish in the first round of the playoffs, the Clippers could be looking to move Harden as part of a broader youth-focused rebuild.\n\nThis deal seems like a win-win for both teams. The Clippers land Tyler Herro, a young sharpshooter who could quickly become the new face of the franchise. Herro averaged 20.8 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game last season, showcasing his scoring ability and playmaking skills. His youth and potential make him an ideal centerpiece for the Clippers' retooling efforts.\n\nThe Miami Heat, in need of a true point guard and always keen to shake things up, would receive James Harden, whose playmaking and scoring would be a huge boost. Last season, Harden put up 16.6 points, 8.5 assists, and 5.1 rebounds per game. He could be the perfect partner for Bam Adebayo in pick-and-roll situations and help relieve Jimmy Butler of some playmaking duties, allowing Butler to focus more on scoring.\n\nAdditionally, the Heat would get Bones Hyland, a promising young guard known for his energy and scoring off the bench. Hyland's versatility and potential to grow could make him a valuable asset for Miami as they continue to contend in the Eastern Conference.\n\nFor the Clippers, acquiring Herro represents a strategic move towards youth and scoring prowess, keeping the team competitive while also building for the future. Meanwhile, the Heat would solidify their backcourt and enhance their championship aspirations by adding a seasoned veteran like Harden, known for his ability to take over games and his playoff experience. This trade could reshape both teams, giving them what they need to tackle their respective challenges in the coming seasons.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers Should Let Go Of Russell Westbrook\n\nAs the Los Angeles Clippers assess their roster moving forward, it's becoming evident that Russell Westbrook may not be the right fit. Despite his stellar regular-season contributions, Westbrook's performance in the postseason left much to be desired, raising questions about his compatibility with the team's young core. With reports circulating about Westbrook seeking opportunities elsewhere, it's clear that a change is imminent.\n\nFor the Clippers, parting ways with Westbrook could open up avenues for younger talent to flourish and for the team to explore different play styles. Westbrook's $4 million Player Option could be better utilized elsewhere if he rejects it and enters free agency, especially if the Clippers aim to bolster their roster with players who better complement their emerging stars.\n\nAs Westbrook hits free agency, teams like the New Orleans Pelicans or a return to Oklahoma City Thunder could provide him with the opportunity he seeks, even if it means accepting a half MLE deal in the range of $7-8 million per season. It's a move that could benefit both Westbrook and the Clippers as they chart their respective paths forward.\n\nYoung Clippers Debut In Intuit Dome\n\nStarting Lineup: Tyler Herro, Bennedict Mathurin, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, Ivica Zubac\n\nBench: Terance Mann, Aaron Nesmith, Norman Powell, Gary Payton II, Amir Coffey, Robert Covington, Goga Bitadze\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers are gearing up for an exciting season at the Intuit Dome with a young and dynamic lineup. The starting roster features Tyler Herro, Bennedict Mathurin, Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, and Ivica Zubac, promising a mix of sharpshooting, athleticism, and solid defense.\n\nHerro, freshly arrived from Miami, is set to lead the team's offense, complemented by Mathurin's energetic play and Wiggins' experienced wing presence. Kuminga offers versatility and high-flying action, while Zubac holds down the paint with reliable rebounding and rim protection.\n\nOff the bench, the Clippers boast depth with players like Terance Mann, Aaron Nesmith, and Norman Powell, each ready to contribute in various roles. Gary Payton II and Amir Coffey add defensive prowess and hustle, enhancing the team's perimeter defense.\n\nNew signings Robert Covington and Goga Bitadze, coming from the 76ers and Orlando respectively, bring veteran leadership and additional defensive capabilities. Covington is known for his three-point shooting and defensive versatility, while Bitadze provides depth at the center position.\n\nThis revamped Clippers team is designed not just to entertain but to compete, blending youthful energy with strategic veteran additions, ready to make a mark in their new home at the Intuit Dome.\n\nA New Chapter For The Clippers Starts\n\nAs the Los Angeles Clippers usher in a new era at the Intuit Dome, they are not just moving into a new home -- they are fundamentally reshaping their identity. With a roster brimming with young talent and a few strategic veteran additions, the Clippers are poised to offer fans an exciting brand of basketball.\n\nTyler Herro, Bennedict Mathurin, and Jonathan Kuminga represent the new core of the team, each bringing unique skills that promise to energize the Clippers' offensive and defensive schemes. Andrew Wiggins and Ivica Zubac add the necessary experience and stability to guide the younger players through the rigors of an NBA season.\n\nThe Clippers' strategy indicates a clear shift towards building a sustainable and exciting team capable of growing together and challenging the established powers in the NBA. As they settle into the Intuit Dome, the Clippers are not just looking to compete; they are looking to captivate, making every game a must-watch event for fans. This season marks the beginning of a promising chapter, one filled with the potential for growth, thrilling plays, and the pursuit of championship glory.", "source": {"uri": "fadeawayworld.net",

Smith Regarding Paul George and Clippers - The SportsRush", "body": "Apr 14, 2024; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Clippers forward Kawhi Leonard (2) forward Paul George (13) and guard James Harden (1) watche game action against the Houston Rockets during the first half at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMany decisions await the Los Angeles Clippers' management before they move to their new arena building in Inglewood next season. The LA Clippers' season was cut short in the first round due to injuries, which leaves a massive question mark regarding the tandem of Kawhi Leonard, Paul George, and James Harden for the next season. With many contracts expiring, many analysts have advised the LA side to break apart this losing combination.\n\nLike ESPN's Stephen A. Smith, former NBA players Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes of All The Smoke podcast also believe it's high time for the Clippers to switch things up before moving to their new home arena. Bringing up the contract situation of the team's superstars, Barnes and Jackson discussed how the Clips might get some good assets in exchange for their stars, who could still be anchors in some teams.\n\nPaul George and James Harden will soon become free agents. On the other hand, Kawhi Leonard's injury situation for the past few seasons doesn't guarantee that he will continue as a player for the Clippers. Russell Westbrook also has a smaller player option.\n\nOn that note, Stak believes that it's high time the Clippers 'blow it up' and start afresh, \"I think it's the perfect time, with the contract situation with everybody, to break it up. You are going to a new arena, you might as well start new. This ain't working.\"\n\n\"You might just try to get new and offload Kawhi if we can. James Harden is a free agent and Paul is definitely going to opt out now as his team is definitely trying to throw him the bag now. This is the perfect time to go to the new arena- new coach, new team, and try something new,\" Stak added.\n\nVery recently, Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe discussed this topic, highlighting Kawhi Leonard's lack of contributions during playoffs. SAS highlighted how Kawhi was present only for four of the Clippers' last 19 playoff games, which definitely shows how the 2x NBA champion is doing just about enough to remain healthy to play the minimum number of games in his contract.\n\nFurthermore, the disappointing playoff showings from James Harden and Paul George have also convinced fans to call for a breakup of this Big 3. Nevertheless, Clippers' President of basketball operations, Lawrence Frank, believes he should instead keep all his players.\n\nThe Clippers seem clear about their intent to retain the Big 3 before moving to the new arena. However, the situation seems precarious, as Paul George has rejected multiple contract offers that weren't max deals, per Shams Charania.\n\nWhile Kawhi Leonard has already signed a max contract extension with the team, George has a player option that he is likely to opt out of. Meanwhile, Harden will be an unrestricted free agent by the end of the season.\n\nGeorge is eligible to sign a four-year extension worth roughly around $221.1 million. If he doesn't sign a new deal by June 30, he could become an unrestricted free agent by declining his $48.8 million player option for the 2024-25 season.\n\nFor George, potential rumblings around the Philadelphia 76ers and the Orlando Magic preparing to sign the All-Star player are running rampant. If the Clippers don't offer him a max contract, PG could very well test his market value in free agency.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "siddid_dey_purkayastha@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Siddid Dey Purkayastha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amway Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Management will have some difficult decisions to make, and it is possible several of the big names Clipper fans have come to know and love could be out of the picture.\n\nOne thing seems certain: Steve Ballmer will not consider going into a rebuild. As the Clippers prepare to move all their operations into the soon-to-be-christened Intuit Dome, one of the main goals will be to drum up excitement for the team and sell plenty of tickets for the first season in the brand new, state-of-the-art arena.\n\nThe Clippers' current core of players certainly has their problems, but one thing they will undoubtedly do is get fans to come out and support the team in person. In terms of on-court performance, Kawhi Leonard's knee of course remains a major issue, and there is legitimate doubt if the Clips can ever live up to their true potential in the 213 era with him at the helm considering his fluctuating health.\n\nThe other half of LA's superstar duo is also a question mark, but in a different way. Paul George is far from a guarantee to remain with the Clippers past this summer, but there are a few reasons why the team may actually be better off without him moving forward.\n\nOf course, LA brought in George in 2019 with the understanding that he was Kawhi's teammate of choice. Leonard was not coming to the Clippers without the knowledge that his running mate would be by his side. And while Paul has been unquestionably the team's second-best player of the last five seasons (even the best at times), his consistency has not always been there.\n\nClippers fans know well that George can score 38 points on incredible efficiency like he did against the Thunder on January 16, and then turn around and drop 12 points on dismal shooting splits the very next game. We have even seen this in PG's playoff performances. He was one of the main reasons LA made the conference finals in 2021, and this season he put up a mostly pedestrian effort in the six-game series with Dallas.\n\nAnother of the biggest reasons the Clippers should consider parting ways with George is his contract situation. The veteran wing will have a player option on his deal for next season worth $48.7 million. PG supposedly wants a new max extension, but it is looking unlikely LA will be willing to give it to him.\n\nThat leaves him still on the roster on an expiring deal, which makes him ripe for either an offseason sign-and-trade, or a midseason trade at the deadline next February. It would be hard to justify extending a player who is so frequently sidelined due to injuries with that price tag.\n\nThe final reason the Clippers may want to move on from George is his increasing age. PG just turned 34 years old, putting him far closer to the end of his career than the beginning. He is still a high-level wing that can have a big impact at both ends of the floor, but that impact is slowly diminishing year by year.\n\nWith age, the potential for injuries of course only increases as well. The Clippers may do well to send Paul elsewhere while he is still relatively healthy and his trade value is high.", "source": {"uri": "clipperholics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clipperholics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intuit Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Ballmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign-and-trade_deal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sign-and-trade deal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5681,h_3195,x_0,y_202/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/81/01hxb8qazt23sbp9v46r.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-16", "textStart": 1913, "textEnd": 1923}], "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

After a 4-2 defeat by the Dallas Mavericks, their early exit from the NBA Playoffs has left many questioning the team's future.\n\nWhen a loaded team gets ousted early in the postseason, many questions about their future will be posed, and speculations will abound. For former NBA champion and respected commentator Stephen Jackson, the time is right for the Clippers to clean house and start anew.\n\nPerfect time to start fresh\n\nAs the Clippers prepare to move into their new home at the Intuit Dome, Stephen Jackson sees this as a prime opportunity for a fresh start. With Paul George and James Harden's free agency and Russell Westbrook's player option, the team's roster is in a state of flux. This uncertainty presents a perfect chance for the Clippers to shake things up and build a new team that could contend for a championship.\n\n\"It's a perfect time with the situational contract situations with everybody. It's the perfect time to break it up. It's a perfect time,\" S-Jax shared on All The Smoke Unplugged.\n\nHealth, or the lack thereof, has always been the Clippers' biggest enemy. The team's stars often played with PG and Harden this season, who suited up in 74 and 72 games, respectively. Meanwhile, Kawhi Leonard, considered the godfather of \"load management,\" played in 68 games, which is the highest game total since the 2016-2017 season.\n\nHowever, right when the Clippers needed the two-time Finals MVP most, Kawhi was nowhere to be found. Due to a lingering knee issue, he played in only two games in the first round.\n\n\"You're going into a new arena; you might as well try to just start new. This ain't working. You might as well just try to get new and try to offload Kawhi if you can. James, a free agent. Paul's definitely going to opt out because there are teams just want to throw him the bag right now. So, this is the perfect time to go into that new arena, new coach, new team, and just try something new,\" Jackson added.\n\nPlayers uncertain of coming back\n\nAccording to All The Smoke co-host Matt Barnes, the most intriguing piece of the puzzle is Kawhi, who the Clippers handed a three-year contract extension that runs until 2027. With PG and Harden's future in LA still up in the air, it would be interesting to see what The Klaw would do this offseason.\n\n\"I think the interesting person on the roster to me is obviously Kawhi, being healthy, and if we're going to get a chance to see that because I think he played -- and I don't want to mistake -- he played a lot of games this year. I know he didn't sit out very much, but when they needed him the most in the playoffs, he wasn't there,\" Barnes said of the two-way beast, who averaged 23.7 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.6 steals per game in the regular season.\n\nBarnes added that PG's decision this summer holds a lot of weight for the team's future.\n\n\"Paul George, you know, there's talks to Indiana, the Knicks, you're hearing a lot of different things. Obviously, this is all speculation right now, but I think Paul George could be the one guy; if he decides to leave, you know, teams are still going to throw him good money. So, it'll be interesting to see where he lands if he does decide to leave,\" Barnes shared.\n\nThe Clippers are a team with many resources and play in a city where most players want to go. However, with the franchise playing in a new arena, how they'll approach this new chapter remains to be seen. Would they keep the same team and run the risk of achieving the same disappointing result? Or would they start anew? It would be safe to say it will be a thrilling offseason for the Clippers.\n\nRelated: \"You're asking me a question that I don't have the answer to\" - James Harden and Paul George on their plans after Clippers exit from playoffs", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intuit Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amway Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Barnes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Barnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/d8/cd887f3b-89ba-57a1-a1f4-d8f685280ab6/663c953bd5c9b.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Turner, who played with George briefly in Indiana, said his former teammate has a history of not showing up.\n\n\"PG has a history of not showing up,\" Turner said. \"Which is an understatement. I never met a human that would let a media rumor drive his energy or personality... You know how soft that team gonna be if he and Embiid go together? It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d probably be the most skilled duo ever since Kobe and Shaq. Embiid would be hurt, and PG gonna be Paul.\"\n\nThe conversation was about stars going back to their former teams, and what George would look like in Indiana alongside Haliburton. Turner shared his skepticism on George's fit with the Pacers or Philadelphia 76ers - the two teams rumored to have interest in the potential free agent.\n\nWhile George has a lot of great moments in the postseason, he has a lot of very low moments as well. This includes this most recent playoff run where George was tasked with leading the Clippers in the absence of Kawhi Leonard, and turned in his worst overall postseason showing in a decade.

That record would be good for the two seed in the East. The Clippers got the five seed Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the playoffs, and they weren't able to get the job done. They lost in six games and were sent home early in the postseason.\n\nAfter a promising regular season, that is not how the Clippers envisioned their playoff run going. They started the series well with a game one win, but they dropped game two at home. After winning a game in Dallas, it turned to a best of three and the Clippers had home court advantage. Losing game five at home by 30 points was the straw that broke the camel's back, however. Dallas won game six at home to finish the series.\n\nPaul George recently talked about the series on his podcast, Podcast P With Paul George. George thinks that the Clippers tried to play \"hero ball\" too often and make big plays when in reality they should've been taking a different approach.\n\n\"We should've played a lot quicker, we should've tried to get in transition more, after rebounds we should have tried to get out and run the lanes,\" Paul George said on his show. \"We should've tried to play on the second side, forced the ball to reverse a couple times, where we could attack with our iso players. But I thought we came down, and rightfully so it happens, you try to play hero ball, you try to make the big plays, you try to be the scorer and be dominant but you fail to realize sometimes you have to take what the defense gives you and it might not be your night, or it might be your night later in the game, opposed to try and will it to be your night, and I think we got in trouble with that.\"\n\nPaul George and James Harden had tough outings in game six\n\nGeorge and Harden could've been who George was talking about in terms of playing hero ball. Both of them shot a lot of threes in game six while facing elimination, and not a lot of them went in. The two were a combined 2-16 from three (13%) in that game. George was 2-10 and Harden was 0-6. The Clippers ended up losing the game by 13 points, 114-101.\n\nThat was a tough way for the Clippers to go out, but there's nothing that they can do about it now besides learn from it. Still, losing in the first round after a good regular season like the one they had is difficult.\n\nThe Mavericks won that series and they are now on to the next round taking on the top seed in the West, the Oklahoma City Thunder. Game one of that series took place earlier in the week and the Thunder ended up pulling away for an easy win.

Golden State was knocked out by Sacramento in a play-in game where Klay Thompson went scoreless. The Warriors missed the playoffs for the third time in the last five seasons and a major personnel revamp is expected particularly as the team leads the league in highest payroll at $209 million. Paying salaries to millionaires who don't deliver is an issue that will be addressed in the offeseason for sure.\n\nSacramento also didn't make it out of the play-in gates despite Domas Sabonis leading the league in double-doubles and triple-doubles. After disposing of Golden State, the Kings were bundled out by New Orleans. In an affront to Sacramento, the Pelicans didn't win a single game in an Oklahoma City sweep in the first round of the playoffs. If New Orleans was that bad, Sacramento had to be worse.\n\nThe two Los Angeles squads advanced to the playoffs but neither made a dent. The Lakers were crushed by Denver in five games despite playing a healthy LeBron James and Anthony Davis. The Clippers took two decisions from Dallas but fell in six just the same. The Mavericks were No. 5 and the Clippers, No. 4 in the West so the outcome was a mild upset. The Clippers lost Kawhi Leonard in the last eight games of the regular season and he sat out four of the six meetings against Dallas. In the two playoff games where Leonard played, the Clippers lost. Paul George and James Harden will be free agents this summer but not Leonard who signed a three-year, $152 million contract extension last January.\n\nThe Clippers will leave Crypto.com Arena to move to the Intuit Dome in Inglewood before the start of next season. For 25 years, the Lakers and Clippers shared Crypto.com Arena, formerly Staples Center, as their home. The transfer to Inglewood may not spark a fan exodus from Crypto.com Arena unless changes are made. As for the Lakers, coach Darvin Ham has been fired and rumored replacement candidates are Mike Budenholzer, Kenny Atkinson, JJ Redick and Clippers' coach Ty Lue. LeBron has a player option to remain with the Lakers next season for $51.4 million or could renegotiate for an extension of two or three more years. He'd like to play with his son Bronny who's among 78 players invited to the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago on May 12-19 but the problem is the 19-year-old, 6-4 Junior isn't anywhere close to being at his father's skill level. This season, Bronny averaged 4.8 points and 19.4 minutes in 25 games, including six starts, with the University of Southern California varsity. Wherever LeBron decides to play next season, expect his team to draft Bronny for sentimental reasons. Unfortunately, father and son won't make a winning combination.", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joaquin_m_henson@philstar.com", "name": "Joaquin M.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nPaul George could soon become the top unrestricted free agent in the NBA, but one of his former teammates seems skeptical that the nine-time All-Star will be a wise investment.\n\nDuring the latest episode of their \"Point Forward\" podcast, former NBA players Evan Turner and Andre Iguodala discussed how well certain superstars would fit if those players went back to their former teams. Iguodala said he thinks the Indiana Pacers would be \"scary\" if they had George back to play alongside Tyrese Haliburton.\n\nTurner, who played in Indiana with George for a brief period in 2014, did not agree. The former No. 2 overall pick believes Haliburton would have to be the guy in that scenario.\n\n\"I'm just saying because that's the only best option because P.G. has a history of not showing up, which is an understatement,\" Turner said. \"I've never met a human that would let a media rumor drive his, like, energy or personality. Somebody was like, 'I heard he going to Philly,' and that n -- - was like, 'You know what, I'm going to Philly, G.'\n\n\"You know how soft that team gonna be if him and (Joel) Embiid go together? It'd probably be the most skilled duo ever since Kobe and Shaq. Embiid would be hurt and P.G. gonna be Paul, though.\"\n\nGeorge has had plenty of big postseason games in his career. There is even a nickname for him that references how good he has been in playoff moments. George is also one of the best players in history to have never played in an NBA finals, however.\n\nGeorge struggled in the Los Angeles Clippers' opening-round loss to the Dallas Mavericks. The Clippers needed him to step up with Kawhi Leonard out, but he shot just over 40% from the field and completely disappeared with just 7 points in a crucial 101-90 loss in Game 3. Perhaps that is fresh on Turner's mind.\n\nAs Turner mentioned, George has been linked to the 76ers. The Clippers still want to re-sign the 34-year-old, and many expect George to remain right where he is.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evan Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Haliburton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Haliburton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/paul-george-clippers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-02-26", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Denver Nuggets are in trouble after dropping their first two games at home to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Why do you think the Nuggets are struggling so much against the Timberwolves?\n\nYaron: Jamal Murray isn't healthy, and Denver was already lacking in depth. But the answer is because of what the Timberwolves have done, and just how good they've become. We're seeing why they were the best defense in the NBA during the regular season; in Rudy Gobert, Jaden McDaniels and Anthony Edwards they might have three of the best 15-or-so defensive players in the league. And they're ability to have one big man defend Jokic so that Gobert can roam the weak side and shut down those lobs that Jokic loves to toss makes them more equipped to slow the Denver attack than anyone. Combine all that with Edwards' ascension on offense and you have the makings of what just might be a juggernaut.\n\nMelissa: Nikola Jokic recently joked that he needs a clone of himself against the Timberwolves' swarming defense and he might be right, especially with Jamal Murray struggling so much offensively. Murray, who is known as one of the top postseason performers in the league, went 6-for-14 from the field in Game 1 and 3-for-18 in Game 2. That's just not going to cut it against the Timberwolves, who are clicking on all cylinders right now, led by bonafide superstar Anthony Edwards.\n\n[Related: Anthony Edwards hears your Michael Jordan comparisons, but 'it's just not possible']\n\n2. The Indiana Pacers nearly stole one from the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden on Monday despite a rough night from Tyrese Haliburton. Should the Knicks be concerned? Are the Pacers a bigger threat than the masses are giving them credit for\n\nYaron: The Knicks should be concerned, but because this is the second round of the playoffs and the Pacers are a good team and a tough one to play, not because of anything the Knicks did wrong. The Pacers play really fast and are really tough to defend, and anyone who thought this was going to be a cakewalk for the Knicks was misguided. That said, the Knicks just have more talent. The way Indy sticks to shooters on defense is going to make life too easy for Jalen Brunson, and I expect the Knicks' size to wear the Pacers down.\n\nMelissa: It's not time for the Knicks to sound the alarm, not with Jalen Brunson scoring 40 or more points in each of his last four games. The Knicks just need to adjust the pace and settle down offensively after finishing with 14 turnovers, compared to the Pacers' 7. A scary point of focus for the Knicks: Their bench was outscored, 46-3. I fully expect the Knicks to make some adjustments in Game 2 and for this to turn into an interesting series. That said, underestimating the Pacers would be a huge mistake.\n\n3. The Dallas Mavericks are in the Western Conference semis after knocking off the LA Clippers in six games. Will we see Paul George back in a Clippers uniform next season? Why or why not?\n\nYaron: Maybe if they hadn't already locked up Kawhi Leonard to a longterm extension there'd be an argument to be made for the Clippers to reset things. And maybe if they weren't moving into a new stadium next season they'd be open to a rebuild. But they did sign Kawhi to an extension, meaning they'd basically have no cap space to replace George even if he did leave. And they are moving into a new building, meaning they're going to want to put a competitive product out on the floor. I expect George's camp to extract as much money as it can via leaks and leverage, but in the end, I'd be surprised if George is not back with the Clippers.\n\nMelissa: The Clippers have reportedly tried to sign George to multiple contract offers beneath the max, which his camp has rejected. The Clippers need to pay up if they want to keep him, which, I expect they will. The Clippers have been one of the NBA's biggest disappointments over the last three years, falling to advance past the first round of the playoffs since reaching the Western Conference Finals in 2021. Even though they can point to the health of their superstars as being their issue, it's clear something has to give. But, from what I hear, they want George back, and here's to betting Steve Ballmer will make that happen.\n\n4. Down the hall, the Los Angeles Lakers are about to begin their search for a new head coach. Which candidate stands out to you as the best fit for this Lakers team?\n\nYaron: None? I just think it's an impossible job. You have to coach a 40-year-old all-time great in LeBron. And deal with all the internal politics that come into play in Lakers-land. And you're inheriting a team with championship expectations despite a roster lacking talent. Ty Lue is one of those coaches who checks all these boxes, which is why the Lakers should have hired him in 2019, but the Clippers aren't going to let him go.\n\nMelissa: Ty Lue is the obvious choice. He led James to a championship in 2016 in Cleveland. They still have a great relationship. And James even publicly lauded him earlier in the season for the way he integrated James Harden into the Clippers' lineup, which was widely interpreted as a dig at Darvin Ham's stream of lineup changes. But Lue is still under contract with the Clippers for another season. And I don't see a world in which Ballmer lets him go.\n\n5. In addition to their head coaching search, the Lakers might be bracing themselves for a future without LeBron James. Do you think James will be back in LA next season, or is there a team that makes more sense for him at this stage of his career?\n\nYaron: I'd be stunned if he was wearing a different uniform next season. There's no situation that fits everything he wants and needs. The Sixers have the cap space and are contenders, but is really going to move cross country? The Warriors would be interesting, but they have no way to sign him, and I don't see LeBron signing for any form of a mid-level exception. Who else is there? And it's not like the Lakers are a wasteland, either.\n\nMelissa: I'd also be floored if James didn't return to the Lakers. He and Anthony Davis still very much believe in one another. He loves LA. And I don't see him uprooting his life and his family at this point in his career. The question is whether the Lakers will be able to make the necessary roster adjustments to actually turn the team into a contender, so they don't squander another one of his unprecedented performances in what will be his 22nd season. It's already clear that the Lakers would be willing to draft James' son, Bronny. Now, we'll see if they can do what it takes to make the roster formidable.\n\nYaron Weitzman is an NBA writer for FOX Sports.

They have over $50 million in cap space to spend, making them a threat in free agency or to swing a big trade.\n\nSince their season came to an end, Paul George has been one of the key players linked to the Sixers. The All-Star forward has a chance to hit the market this summer if he declines his player option. George and the Clippers have had talks about an extension, but the two sides were never able to agree on a deal.\n\nDuring a recent episode of ESPN's Get Up, Jay Williams shared his thoughts on the Sixers acquiring George this offseason. He feels pairing him with Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey instantly makes Philly a contender.\n\n\"I think they'd be right there in the championship contending range,\" Williams said. \"You think about him, Joel Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, now you have the youth. Now you have someone who can help you carry a lot of the weight during the course of the regular season. And I think that's really big for Joel Embiid.\"\n\n13 years into his NBA career, George is still competing at an All-Star level. However, he is getting ready to enter his mid-30s. The nine-time All-Star is fresh off celebrating his 34th birthday. This could be a cause for concern for the Sixers, especially considering George's injury history.\n\nOne positive is that George was a nightly fixture in the Clippers lineup this season. He appeared in 74 games for LA, his most in a season since his time with the OKC Thunder. George averaged 22.6 PPG, 5.2 RPG, and 3.5 APG during the regular season.\n\nFor now, all the Sixers can do is wait to see what George decides to do regarding his player option.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_Thunder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City Thunder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4905,h_2759,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_76ers/01hxf3ke2pm32ppvbw4y.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

At 34, there's a serious chance this upcoming contract is his last. It makes sense that George is pursuing a max deal, but all signs indicate the Clippers are unwilling to satisfy those desires.\n\nPlenty of franchises (LA included) could use a player like George on the roster. Although his athleticism has dramatically diminished since breaking into the league with the Indiana Pacers, he's still a professional scorer with guard-like handles who can play relentless defense. He's still a fringe All-NBA candidate and appears to have some gas left in the tank.\n\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are the presumed favorite to land George's services if he leaves Tinseltown. For all the talent he possesses, some are skeptical of his ability when the lights are brightest, especially if paired with Joel Embiid. In a recent episode of his Point Forward podcast, former NBA journeyman Evan Turner questioned George's toughness while acknowledging his tremendous ability on the floor.\n\n\"PG has a history of not showing up, which is an understatement ,\" Turner said. \"I've never met a human who will let a media rumor drive his energy or personality like that. You know how soft Philly would be if he and Embiid go together? It's probably be the most skilled duo ever since Kobe and Shaq. Embiid would be hurt and PG would be Paul though.\"\n\nThe influx of former role players starting a podcast has to be one of the worst things that has happened to modern basketball discourse. Like two guys in their college dorm room, these former athletes also want to drive consumers to subscribe to their show and have their clips spread across social media -- just ask Patrick Beverly.\n\nTurner and George played 39 games together for the Pacers in 2013-14. The latter was 24 at the time, in the midst of his breakout season. Is it fair to judge that guy compared to the seasoned veteran at the tail end of his career? It sure doesn't seem fair.\n\nI subscribe to the notion that George and Embiid would be a gifted tandem that fails to get over the hump due to injuries, much like his current situation in LA. Would they be the most skilled duo since Shaq and Kobe? No, not even close. LeBron and Dwayne Wade, Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, and Steph Curry and Kevin Durant are just the tip of the iceberg when discussing the best recent pairs.\n\nGeorge has had playoff struggles but is not a complete bum when the games matter most. Kawhi Leonard's recent playoff injury woes thrust him into the first option role, further exposing his inconsistencies. At this stage, he projects as a weak second or strong third-best player on a title team, which most organizations would love to have.\n\nTurner's word vomit was impressive and proved that even those who reach the highest level don't always know what they're talking about.", "source": {"uri": "clipperholics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clipperholics"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evan Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-NBA_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-NBA Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Durant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Durant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5656,h_3181,x_0,y_76/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/81/01hxdz19yejb0xcgwnpc.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Many teams will be interested in acquiring the nine-time All-Star forward, but one potential destination that has been mentioned is the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nHowever, former Sixer and now sports commentator Evan Turner doesn't believe that George and Joel Embiid would make a good pairing on the court. In a discussion on \"Point Forward\" with Andre Iguodala, Turner explained that PG's history of coming up short in big moments would not mesh well with Embiid's inadequacies, which can be a potent recipe for disaster in the \"City of Brotherly Love.\"\n\nHistory of playoff disappointments\n\nThe postseason is typically a time when the cream rises to the top. However, for PG, moments like those have been few and far between. Take the Los Angeles Clippers' recent flame-out against the Dallas Mavericks. Despite having enough talent to go toe-to-toe with any team in the loaded Western Conference, the Clippers were ousted by the Mavs in six games.\n\nGeorge played a substantial role in the disappointing early exit as he followed up his excellent 33-point, eight-assist showing in Game 4 with subpar performances in Games 5 and 6, which ended in lopsided losses to send the Clippers packing for Cancun.\n\n\"PG has a history of not showing up, which is an understatement,\" Turner said.\n\nThe 10-year vet surmised that while Paul is as skilled and talented as any top-tier star in the league, he might not have enough mental fortitude to combat criticism and adversity in the playoffs.\n\n\"I never met a human that will let a media rumor drive his energy or personality like somebody would be like, 'I heard he's going to Philly,' and that nig*** be like, 'You know what, I'm going to Philly, G.' But I could bet any guarantee he was like, 'You know, I started looking at real estate in Philly,'\" Evan added.\n\nAwkward fit\n\nPG signing with the Sixers would give Philly a formidable \"Big 3.\" With the uber-talented Tyrese Maxey, Embiid, and George, Philadelphia would have enough firepower and tenacity to combat the league's best squads. However, questions regarding Joel's availability and Paul's mental fortitude persist, with Turner saying the Sixers may become the league's softest squad if the two teamed up.\n\n\"Do you know how soft the team's gonna be if him and Embiid go together?\" Turner boldly quipped.\n\n\"It'll probably be one of the most disappointing, like just unbelievably talented. It probably be the most skilled duo ever since Kobe and Shaq, that's an understatement, and then probably Embiid and PG gonna be hurt,\" he added.\n\nPG's free agency will be one of the most closely monitored situations this offseason. Whatever team he ends up joining will no doubt become better. However, it would be interesting to see if he decides to join the Sixers and form a dynamic duo with Embiid. Would they truly be the league's softest squad, or would they prove their doubters wrong and dominate the court?\n\nRelated: \"You're asking me a question that I don't have the answer to\" - James Harden and Paul George on their plans after Clippers exit from playoffs", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonas_panerio@postandcourier.com", "name": "Jonas Panerio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evan Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/1a/c1a60b06-08e4-5ed7-a20d-e24c6e03bf70/663ce29608e3c.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Seemingly everyone has an opinion on the topic, including former Sixers, as we heard on the Point Forward podcast with Andre Iguodala and Evan Turner,\n\nIn a segment discussing hypothetical scenarios of superstars returning home, starting around the 29:45 mark, Iguodala says the Indiana Pacers would be scary with George back in the fold. However, Turner does not seem to hold George in high regard. Remember that the two were briefly teammates after the Sixers traded The Villain to the Pacers at the 2014 trade deadline. That Pacers team finished 56-26 in the regular season, before losing 4-2 to the Heatles Miami squad in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nHere's Turner on a possible George-Pacers reunion, before veering off into the current free agency rumors:\n\n\"I think their kryptonite would always be what it is. Haliburton would have to mature into like a go-to game-ender, which he's had some moments...That's the only best option, because PG has a history of not showing up, which is an understatement.\n\nI never met a human that would let a media rumor drive his energy or personality. Somebody's like 'I heard he going to Philly' and that [guy]'s like 'You know what? I'm going to Philly, G.' I could bet any guarantee he was like, 'You know, I started looking at real estate in Philly.' Do you know how soft that team gonna be if him and Embiid go together?...It would probably be the most skilled duo ever since Kobe and Shaq. That's an understatement. Embiid would be hurt and PG gonna be Paul, though.\"\n\nMan, Evan Turner does not appear to be a Paul George fan. I don't find the 'not showing up' criticism to be fair at all. It's not George's fault that he enters his prime just as a Superteam of LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh formed in Miami. Those Heat-Pacers series were some battles, even if Indiana could never quite get over the hump.\n\nTo me, Turner is probably still salty he only received 12.4 minutes per game (averaging 3.3 points) during that 2014 postseason with Indiana. On the flip side, George averaged 22.6 points on .438/.403/.789 shooting splits, 7.6 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 2.2 steals during that postseason. Oh, and he was the primary LeBron defender in that series. George had two separate postseasons with Indiana and Oklahoma City where he averaged over 28 points per game. Turner was a career 37.2 percent shooter from the field in the postseason.\n\nAs for the Embiid and George pairing, I think it's fair to point out that both players have recent injury histories. It's certainly something that should be taken into consideration if you're Daryl Morey and considering throwing max-ish money at George in free agency. Turner seems to completely ignore the presence of Tyrese Maxey, however, who would still slot in as the No. 2 scoring option if George were to come to Philadelphia.\n\nUltimately, Turner seems to have a bone to pick with George, and clearly isn't a fan of the city where he was once drafted second overall, as he goes on to bash Philadelphia fans at the tail end of the podcast. There are perfectly fair counterpoints to the idea that the Sixers should sign Paul George, but I don't believe taking into account what Evan Turner thinks is one of them.", "source": {"uri": "libertyballers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Ballers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_kennedy@libertyballers.com", "name": "Sean Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Turner", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evan Turner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Embiid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joel Embiid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Point guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaquille_O'Neal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shaquille O'Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrese_Maxey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrese Maxey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daryl Morey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bosh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Bosh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steal (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_per_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Points per game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwyane_Wade", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwyane Wade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45O7tYopyDyrK2NQ2u5kSO1VTh0=/0x408:4890x2853/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440595/1098004206.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

I don't watch current players now to be, like, working on my game. I watch a ton of Kobe s--t. I watch a ton of T-Mac s--t. And honestly, that's it. Just for me, it's the mentality. I watch the mentality of what Kobe would do in situations. And then watch the footwork, watch the, you know, just his attack angles. He might do one dribble and then go left. Or raise up over a smaller defender. Or he spots where the open space on the floor is.\"\n\nGeorge, 34, has long been one of the best two-way players in the league, and he is coming off the ninth All-Star season of his career.\n\nAs part of a veteran superstar trio with Kawhi Leonard and James Harden, George averaged 22.6 points, 5.2 rebounds, 3.5 assists, 3.3 three-pointers made and 1.5 steals per game.\n\nAlso, his 74 games played were his most in a single season since the 2018-19 campaign when he was with the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nGeorge is a four-time NBA All-Defensive Team selection, and while Kobe and T-Mac were both primarily known for their offensive abilities, they were both fierce competitors who rarely gave an inch to their opponents.\n\nIn many respects, George is similar in that regard, which is likely a big reason why he has enjoyed so much success over the years.\n\nFor as great of a player as George has been for Indiana Pacers, Thunder and Clippers, however, playoff success has largely eluded him, as he has never reached the NBA Finals, let alone won a championship.\n\nMcGrady never won a title either, but Kobe was one of the greatest playoff performers in NBA history, winning five championships and two NBA Finals MVP awards.\n\nDespite securing the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference this season, George and the Clips experienced an early playoff exit, falling to the Dallas Mavericks in six games in the first round.\n\nNow, George enters a pivotal time in his career, as he can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this offseason if he so chooses.\n\nBryant remained loyal to the Lakers throughout his career and it worked out in his favor, but with George nearing the twilight of his career, he has a tough decision to make in terms of where to pursue a title.\n\nRegardless of where George ends up, the team will be getting a complete player who has the desire to follow in the footsteps of some of the all-time greats.", "source": {"uri":

They were packing the paint and I should have saw that earlier -- let me just bait them and free up shots for teammates.\n\n\"When you have a rough game, you don't play well, your natural follow-up to that is to be more aggressive, which I was playing right into their hands at that point... So I'm like Game 6, I got to be more aggressive to score, which wasn't the answer. So I mean hindsight you think about those things, but it's a game. It's the reason why it's a game. You play the game to win and sometimes you're on the opposite end of it,\"\n\nGeorge averaged 19.5 points on 41.1 percent shooting, including 36.7 percent on threes, in the six games with Dallas. In Los Angeles' pivotal Game 6 loss, he went 6-of-18 from the field for 18 points, and to his assertion, it probably was a case of trying to do too much. Ten of his shot attempts were from long range.\n\nOf course, singling out the nine-time All-Star would be a little unfair. One reason the Mavs could focus so much of their defensive efforts on George was because they didn't have to worry about Kawhi Leonard. Knee trouble limited Leonard to two games in the opening round and he was clearly at less than 100 percent for the 59 minutes he played.\n\nEven if George had shot the ball more efficiently, it may not have been enough to save the short-handed Clippers.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zucker@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joseph Zucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/x_3,y_0,w_1792,h_1192,c_crop/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715276938/cjvwmufnwbgklqgnifl5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

On the latest episode of his podcast, George explained what went wrong for the Clippers.\n\n\"I think we relied on too much isolation, which their whole game-plan was to load up and force someone else to make plays and force other people to shoot,\" George explained. \"So, they were sending multiple defenders, they were plugging, they were forcing, kind of shutting the lane off by coming over and fake doubles, sending doubles. I think they were mixing a lot of coverage up, which was making it hard to catch a rhythm.\"\n\nGeorge added what the Clippers should have done differently against the Mavs.\n\n\"We should have played a lot quicker. We should have tried to get in transition more,\" he said. \"We should have, after rebounds, tried to get out and run the lanes and we should have played on the second side, forced the ball to reverse a couple times, where we could attack with our ISO players.\"\n\nThe Clippers won Game 1 of the series but only managed to win one more over the next five games. George averaged 19.5 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 4.8 assists during the series, while shooting 41.1% from the field.\n\nThose aren't exactly acceptable statistics, knowing what the Clippers typically expect from George (particularly in Kawhi Leonard's absence). He had an impressive 33-point performance in Game 4 that propelled the Clippers to their other win, but he was otherwise underwhelming.\n\nGeorge's performance could factor into what the Clippers are willing to offer him his offseason should he opt for free agency. George has a player option worth $48,787,676, and he can test unrestricted free agency.\n\nWhen asked about George's future, Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank made it clear that they want to keep him. However, the two sides haven't been able to agree on an extension.\n\n\"We want to retain those guys,\" Frank said of George and James Harden. \"We're hopeful we can. But also understand and respect the fact that they're free agents. Paul has a decision with his option. James will be an unrestricted free agent. So, our intent is to bring them back, but also realize that they are elite players and they'll have choices.\"\n\n\"I think that we want Paul, we value Paul,\" Frank added. \"Paul's done some tremendous things here. He's an elite player and our biggest thing is, we always want to be able to treat players well and pay them fairly, and we also have to build out a team, especially this is a new CBA. But in terms of the exact money, I would never go into details other than that we've had really really good conversations over the course of the year and hopeful that we can get him to remain a Clipper.\"\n\nAs Frank mentioned, the Clippers have to think about whether this core will bring them a title. Even if it's due to factors that's outside of their control, it's worth noting that the Clippers have not won a playoff series since making their first Western Conference Finals run in 2021.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Frank", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawrence Frank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Harden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawhi_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kawhi Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Continental Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/Luka%20Doncic%20Paul%20George%20050224.jpg?itok=kCrZXJOx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550752", "eventUri": "eng-9550752", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 452992365, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 21, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 21}}}

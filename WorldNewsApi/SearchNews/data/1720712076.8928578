{"id": 232039090, "title": "Going Home by Tom Lamont review \u2013 a debut with charm to burn", "text": "Charm is an underrated quality in fiction, perhaps because it\u2019s seen as a soft power, unlike supposedly more rigorous features such as plot and structure. It comes from an alchemical blend of elements including narrative voice and character, and Tom Lamont\u2019s debut novel, Going Home, set in the Jewish community in Enfield, north London, has charm to burn. Largely, this comes from the central character, a two-year-old boy named Joel, whose scattershot viewpoint opens the book. \u201cHe collects answers to your questions. Joel Woods. Two! Salt-and-vinegar flavour.\u201d He\u2019s playing in the park and the voice sketches his distractible vision (\u201cJoel saw another bird. Right, you\u201d) while dealing just enough information to the reader. Best of all, Lamont \u2013 an award-winning Observer and Guardian journalist before turning to fiction \u2013 rations Joel\u2019s appearances carefully and we don\u2019t get his viewpoint for the rest of the novel. He remains the central character, however, simply because the four people we do hear from are all focused on him. First come T\u00e9o Erskine and his father, Vic. T\u00e9o is a young man who has come back to Enfield from the city to see his dad, who\u2019s living with a degenerative condition. \u201cOne of the surname illnesses. Your slow declines.\u201d T\u00e9o used to go to school with Lia, Joel\u2019s single mother, and is still sweet on her. He babysits Joel for her sometimes, less out of altruism than hoping Lia will be impressed with \u201cthe value he was demonstrating\u201d. Lia sees T\u00e9o as responsible \u2013 a planner and a plodder \u2013 so she may never see him any other way. His friend and opposite is Ben Mossam, a rich kid whose parents moved away and left him their big house; he can afford to be impetuous. He wears a yarmulke not because he is a particularly observant Jew but because \u201che appreciated how it made women curious, and how it put men on their guard\u201d. (Oddly, the words jew and jewish in the novel are presented thus, and never capitalised.) The story cycles between T\u00e9o, Vic, Ben and Sibyl, a new local rabbi, and the story has so many developments \u2013 some unexpected, others foreseeable \u2013 that it\u2019s impossible for a reviewer to go far into the plot. But Joel stays with T\u00e9o longer than expected and the meat of the book is their growing relationship, both aided and impeded by Vic, Ben and Sibyl. Vic\u2019s sections are among the strongest, portraying his own masculine upbringing as well as offering one of the book\u2019s more surprising hairpin bends. Ben is harder for Lamont to animate, given his shtick is to be smug and broadly unsympathetic. Along the way we get nice observations on modern life (\u201cpeople were coming out of the cafe holding [...] sensational coffees, comedy coffees, too heavy to lift one-handed\u201d), but the book always springs to life when Joel is on the page, whether sweetly articulating himself while playing I-spy (\u201csomething beginner will \u2026 blue\u201d) or giving the other characters perspective. \u201cJoel viewed anybody older, taller, as expert. [He] was the only person in Vic\u2019s life who didn\u2019t hold his illness against him.\u201d And all the while, each character accelerates towards the end of their own story and all four head for a convergence. There are moments along the way that strain plausibility, but these don\u2019t seem to matter in a book that succeeds so strongly through its charm and its heart.", "summary": "<p>The award-winning journalist\u2019s first novel is a well-observed tale enriched by the perspective of a small boy</p><p>Charm is an underrated quality in fiction, perhaps because it\u2019s seen as a soft power, unlike supposedly more rigorous features such as plot and structure.

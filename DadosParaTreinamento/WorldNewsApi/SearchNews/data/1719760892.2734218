The abrupt end to the Scandinavian country\u2019s 200 years of neutrality following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and officials\u2019 warnings about the Russian threat to Sweden itself, worry many. Teenagers are no exception. Masai Bj\u00f6rkwall helped design a national program to educate students on the history and geopolitics of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization after students at Viktor Rydberg Junior High School earlier this year anxiously asked if war might come to Sweden. Their fears had been sparked by comments from the country\u2019s top military commander and the civil defense minister that there was a risk of war and that Swedes must prepare. The statements spread quickly, and the national children\u2019s help line reported an increase in questions about war. Sweden\u2019s last war ended in 1814. \u201cOf course, we have to deal with the students\u2019 worries about risk for conflict and war, and explain why we joined. We have had the policy of neutrality for so long, several hundred years,\u201d Bj\u00f6rkwall said. \u201cSo I have to teach about what has happened in the world, what has changed that made us change our policy.\u201d For teens unfamiliar with NATO, war and world politics, Bj\u00f6rkwall\u2019s new syllabus seeks to demystify topics his students see online. One lesson included a discussion of the implications of NATO\u2019s Article 5, the alliance\u2019s collective defense clause under which an attack against one ally is considered an attack against all allies. The discussion stressed that the clause doesn\u2019t lead to an automatic military response. Student Linnea Ekman didn\u2019t see any increased threat, pointing out that Article 5 does not require sending troops. Another student, Edith Maxence, was concerned about the world becoming more divided as Sweden takes sides. \u201cI feel safe that Sweden is with NATO, but I feel unsafe that (\u2026) it might start a war,\u201d said the 14-year-old. She isn\u2019t alone. Children\u2019s Rights in Society, which runs the national child help line, has seen increasing numbers of calls from children asking whether NATO membership increases the risk to Sweden. Callers rarely asked about war before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But the secretary-general of BRIS, Magnus J\u00e4gerskog, said that nearly 20% of calls were about war in the week after military chief Micael Byd\u00e9n and Civil Defense Minister Carl-Oskar Bohlin made their comments in January highlighting the risk. Addressing such concerns is where the program Bj\u00f6rkwall helped design comes in. Together with UR, a publicly funded civic education agency that creates educational content for teachers and students, he and others produced a series of video programs on NATO along with teaching materials. Launched in March, these programs have now reached an estimated 100,000 Swedish children. For his final-year students, Bj\u00f6rkwall has a more challenging question: Should Sweden align with authoritarian countries? He uses as examples Turkey and Hungary - NATO allies that delayed Sweden\u2019s membership for months after Nordic neighbor Finland had joined. The class is divided, with nearly half of the students unsure. \u201cWe found it hard to make one conclusion,\u201d said 15-year-old Adam Sahlen but acknowledged that \u201cthe military gets stronger and better if we cooperate with others, especially Turkey for example.\u201d Bj\u00f6rkwall said he\u2019s careful to avoid advocating one position over another: \u201cI want them to be mature, democratic citizens that can vote consciously later on.\u201d", "summary": "The teacher's opening question to students in Stockholm is blunt: \"Has joining NATO increased the threat to Sweden?\"", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/may/29/sweden-seeking-to-answer-worried-students-question/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/05/29/Sweden_Explaning_NATO_10863.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:17:08", "author": "Chisato Tanaka", "authors": ["Chisato Tanaka"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.159}

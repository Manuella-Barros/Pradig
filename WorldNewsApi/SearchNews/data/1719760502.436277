The Spice Girl's Instagram account shared a slew of snaps of the longtime friends together but a mistake in the caption quickly revealed that Geri wasn't the one to make the post. Alongside the images, the caption read: 'Sent images to Pippa and this wording asked her to tweak where needed. 'Happy birthday @officialmelb ! Hope you have an amazing day! [party emojis].' A few minutes later the caption was amended to remove the first line, but not before eagle-eyed fans had spotted it and flooded the comment section with sassy remarks. Fans shared: 'Brilliant! That\u2019s one heartfelt birthday post!'; 'I keep refreshing yet it\u2019s still there'; 'Caption is changed\u2026. But we all saw it'; 'Confirmation celebs don\u2019t even post legit birthday messages'; 'When your social media person does a copy and paste'; '*insert warm greeting*'; 'Anyone else singing \u2018Goodbye, my Friend\u2019?! as they read this?!' Others were concerned for 'Pippa', joking: 'Goodbye Pippa, I know you\u2019re gone, you said you\u2019re gone but I can still feel you here'; 'When your social media person does a copy and paste'; 'Pippa you in danger girl' 'Sending much love to Pippa on this day, she might need a wine glass or two'; 'Friendship never ends... unless Pippa gets involved'; 'Pippa, I\u2019d tweak it to add a little more sincerity'; 'Babe you need to sort your social media manager out.' The gaffe will no doubt do little to ease tensions after their 'frosty' reunion at Victoria Beckham's 50th birthday bash last month. The star-studded soiree saw all five of the Spice Girls come together to party but it was claimed Mel and Geri's greeting was tense. Despite having posed for a smiley snap with Victoria, Mel C and Emma Bunton, The Sun claimed Mel and Geri were feeling tense. Prior to the reunion, Mel B claimed in an interview that Geri has lied about her age for years and is not 51-years-old. Despite travelling the world together in the band's heyday, Scary Spice claimed Geri always kept her passport close to her chest so she 'still doesn't know' how old she is. After the interview the pair were said to have kept a distance from each other at Victoria's party - before Mel reportedly tried to offer and olive branch. A source told the publication: 'Mel tried to smooth things over with Geri at the party but it didn't go as planned. She was laughing it all off but Geri didn't seem interested in hearing what she had to say and wandered off. 'When it came to taking their group picture, Geri kept as far away from Mel as possible which was awkward to watch. 'Geri wanted to be there to celebrate -and have a good laugh with everyone, not talk to Mel about the embarrassing things she's said about her.' Mel previously said on Piers Morgan's Life Stories that she and her and Geri had previously slept together. In the clip, Piers is seen asking Mel: 'You were coming here to be brutally honest - did or didn't you sleep with Geri Halliwell? Did you sleep with her?' Looking bashful, Mel at first tries to dodge the question, telling Piers: 'Yeah. We all slept in a bed together, but not like that, all of us.' But Piers was relentless, asking: 'Did you sleep with Geri like that?' to which Mel smiles and nods as a shocked Piers checks, 'Yes? Really?' 'She's going to hate me for this because she's all posh in her country house with her husband,' said Mel of Geri, who is married to Formula 1 team boss Christian Horner.", "summary": "The Spice Girl's Instagram account shared a slew of snaps of the longtime friends together but a mistake in the caption quickly revealed that Geri wasn't the one to post.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13470985/Geri-Halliwell-mercilessly-mocked-fans-making-epic-blunder-birthday-tribute-Mel-B-frosty-Spice-Girls-reunion-singing-goodbye-friend-read-this.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/29/10/85459203-0-image-m-27_1716973323092.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:01:08", "author": "Editor,Rebecca Lawrence", "authors": ["Editor", "Rebecca Lawrence"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.084}

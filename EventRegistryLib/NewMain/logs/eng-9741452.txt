It is unclear when he will be extradited back to Texas. Waco police say they were made aware of a sexual assault that happened in 2013 involving Odiong.

The sheriff's office said the Archdiocese of New Orleans reached out after a claim in the Archdiocese Bankruptcy Case had been filed by the attorney of an unnamed 54-year-old woman. That woman claimed she had been assaulted by Odiong, and had reported it to a deputy four years prior. The sheriff's office found that report, which stated the woman described a consensual sexual relationship. The report said the deputies told her that what she described was not a crime. The news release from the sheriff went on to say that deputies contacted her attorney, who said she did not want to come forward and provide a statement on the alleged assault she reported through the bankruptcy case. The St. Charles Sheriff's Office confirmed Wednesday that not other potential victims have come forward to report a sexual assault since the arrest was announced Tuesday. The Archdiocese of New Orleans issued the following statement regarding Odiong's arrest: \"This morning, July 16, 2024, the Archdiocese of New Orleans was made aware of the arrest of Anthony Odiong on charges related to possession of child pornography.

Anthony Odiong, the priest dismissed last year from St. Anthony of Padua Church in Luling, was arrested Tuesday morning in Florida on a Texas warrant accusing him of possession of child pornography, according to authorities.\n\nThe Waco Police Department is also investigating allegations that the Catholic priest sexually assaulted many other victims.\n\n\"Multiple women have come forward to tell similar experiences as the sexual assault survivor who reported the initial allegation in 2012, Waco Detective Bradley DeLange said in a statement released Tuesday.\n\n\"Survivors' experiences ranged from sexual assault, indecent assault -- more commonly known as groping, and financial abuse, with some survivors experiencing every element of Anthony Odiong's manipulation,\" DeLange said.\n\nOdiong could not be reached for comment Tuesday. An attorney who previously represented him also could not be reached for comment.\n\nTexas investigation\n\nWaco police opened their investigation in March after an unidentified victim reported the 2012 sexual abuse by Odiong.\n\nBefore his appointment to St. Anthony in 2015, Odiong served as the director of campus ministry at St. Peter's Catholic Student Center at Baylor University in Waco from 2007 to 2012.\n\nWhile investigating the complaint, detectives obtained a search warrant for Odiong's iCloud online data storage account and uncovered images of a child being sexually abused, according to The Guardian.\n\nDeLang obtained a warrant for Odiong's arrest for possession of child pornography. He was taken into custody at his residence by the Collier County Sheriff's Office and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nOdiong was being held Tuesday evening at the Collier County jail while awaiting extradition to Texas.\n\n\"If you have been victimized by Anthony Odiong anywhere in the United States, I need to hear from you,\" DeLange said. \"You are not alone and you do not have to continue to live with the trauma of this experience alone.\"\n\nDeLange applauded the survivors who have already come forward and assured that respect for their experiences is the department's highest priority. Survivors will not be made to go to court or have their names made public, if they don't want to.\n\n\"The Waco Police Department stands ready to assist survivors no matter where they may be,\" DeLange said.\n\nRemoval from St. Anthony\n\nOdiong pastored the congregation at St. Anthony of Padua Church in Luling for eight years until the Archdiocese of New Orleans dismissed him in December 2023. At the time, Archdiocese officials said they had become aware of \"concerns... about Father Anthony's ministry\" that occurred prior to and possibly during his time in Louisiana.\n\nOdiong had been accused of sexual and financial abuse by a woman who filed the allegations as a claim in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court as part of the Archdiocese's Chapter 11 reorganization. The woman said Odiong, whom she'd known since 2007, had exhibited years of controlling, manipulative and lewd behavior.\n\nAfter the claim was filed, the Archdiocese of New Orleans notified the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office because the victim reported that one of the acts occurred in St. Charles.\n\nThe Sheriff's Office has said that a detective who spoke with the woman in 2019 determined that the sexual encounter in St. Charles Parish appeared to be consensual and did not constitute a criminal act, the department said in a statement released last year.\n\nOdiong posted a public statement on Facebook in April refuting the allegations against him in St. Charles, accusing the woman of retaliation.\n\nOdiong was relieved of his position with St. Anthony a month early after a Nov. 26 Mass in which he made disparaging remarks about LGBTQ+ people and church divisions, telling the congregation, \"We're going to begin to bless all kind of monkeys and animals and chimpanzees.\"\n\nThose who believe they have been victimized by The Rev. Anthony Odiong are asked to call Detective Bradley DeLange at the Waco Police Department at 254-750-7609.", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And he allegedly managed to pressure the other woman into letting her husband sodomize her despite her faith-based objections to that kind of encounter - while also successfully urging her to relay her experience to him\n\nThose graphic details were revealed in warrants obtained by Waco, Texas, police on Thursday that charged Odiong with two counts of violating a state law which criminalizes sexual activity between clergymen and adults who emotionally depend on their spiritual advice.\n\nAs sworn probable cause statements filed with the warrants note, Waco investigators began scrutinizing Odiong - who had previously worked in Texas and south-east Louisiana - after a report from the Guardian in February highlighted how at least three other women acquainted with the clergyman had publicly accused him of misconduct ranging from sexual coercion and unwelcome touching to financial abuse.\n\nThe allegations had led the Catholic diocese of Austin - which is in charge of church institutions in Waco - as well as the archdiocese of New Orleans to suspend Odiong from working in their regions in 2019 and this past December, respectively.\n\nBut police had not meaningfully investigated Odiong, 55, until a woman with the pseudonym Mary Doe printed out the Guardian's February article, handed it to a detective at Waco police headquarters and described having sexual intercourse with the clergyman while he gave her \"spiritual direction\" from 2008 until 2011.\n\n\"Mary said she felt she could not revoke consent or say no to [Father] Odiong due to his authority as a Catholic priest,\" the lead investigator on the case, Bradley DeLange, wrote under oath.\n\nDeLange's ensuing investigation then brought him into communication with a woman given the pseudonym of Jane Doe. She alleged that Odiong would plant open-mouth kisses on her, grope her and ultimately ordered her to submit to sodomy with her husband to heal her troubled marriage while counseling her in about 2010.\n\nJane Doe said she had religious reasons for avoiding that act in particular - but she did it and then recounted it to Odiong because he was her priest, according to DeLange's sworn statements.\n\nUltimately, DeLange secured judicial permission to search Odiong's iCloud data storage account. DeLange subsequently wrote under oath that he discovered illicit images depicting \"a clearly prepubescent [disrobed] child\" that had been saved to the iCloud account in September 2020.\n\nDeLange said there were also two more images of who is apparently another child with an unclothed body part being grabbed by someone who appeared to be an adult.\n\nA judge signed off on a warrant for DeLange to arrest Odiong on a count of child abuse imagery possession. On Tuesday, authorities arrested Odiong on that warrant at his home in Ave Maria, Florida.\n\nWaco police that day issued a statement asking anyone else \"victimized by Anthony Odiong anywhere in the United States\" to call DeLange.\n\nA total of at least eight accusers had come forward to DeLange with sexual misconduct allegations against Odiong by Thursday. They included a woman from the Louisiana community of Luling, about 20 miles (32km) from New Orleans, who described going to Odiong for guidance \"during a traumatically difficult time in life\" sometime after he arrived there in 2015 - yet he eventually met her with kissing and breast fondling, including under her clothes.\n\nOdiong \"expressed a desire and pressured her to continue escalating the sexual contact, but ... she declined to go further repeatedly\", DeLange's sworn statements said.\n\nThe number of accusers against Odiong cleared the way for Waco police to charge him Thursday with sexual assault. Texas deems filing deadlines known as statutes of limitation irrelevant if a \"defendant has committed the same or similar sex offense against five or more victims\", according to the state's laws.\n\nOdiong remained in custody in Florida without any bail set as of Friday. It was not immediately clear when he may be transferred to Waco to face the child abuse imagery and sexual assault charges pending against him.\n\nOdiong was ordained into the Catholic priesthood in the diocese of Uyo, Nigeria, in 1993. He was allowed to work within the diocese of Austin in 2006 by the then bishop Gregory Aymond.\n\nAnd about six years after he became the archbishop of New Orleans in 2009, Aymond invited Odiong to work in Luling.\n\nOdiong built a reputation for himself by hosting so-called healing masses after which some congregants reported recovering from significant medical maladies, boosting church attendance along with his popularity among church goers and his superiors.\n\nPlaces where Odiong was stationed over the years included the St Peter Catholic student center on the outskirts of Baylor University's campus in Waco as well as Luling's St Anthony of Padua church.\n\nOdiong's recent criminal charges came after a social media account under his name published an open letter dismissing all claims against him as a \"false, salacious, one-sided smear campaign\".\n\nHis charges also constituted a fresh scandal for the New Orleans archdiocese, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2020 as it struggled to contain the fallout of the worldwide church's decades-old clergy abuse crisis.\n\nIn April, Louisiana state police troopers served a search warrant on the archdiocese in April as part of an investigation into whether the church and its local leadership had run a child-sex trafficking ring responsible for \"widespread sexual abuse of minors dating back decades\" that was \"covered up and not reported to law enforcement\".\n\nIt was unclear Friday whether the troopers spearheading that investigation intended to speak with Odiong about his time within New Orleans' archdiocese.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramon_antonio_vargas@theguardian.com", "name": "Ramon Antonio Vargas", "type":

It said a total of eight victims had come forward alleging Odiong tried to use his influence as a priest to pursue sexual contact they either did not welcome or to which they could not consent.\n\nTexas is one of about a dozen states with a law that criminalizes sexual activity between clergymen and adults who emotionally depend on their spiritual advice. Furthermore, Texas deems statutes of limitation - or filing deadlines - irrelevant if a \"defendant has committed the same or similar sex offense against five or more victims\", according to officials.\n\nThe investigation which led to Odiong's arrest began after the Guardian published a report in February detailing prior allegations that ranged from sexual coercion and unwelcome touching to financial abuse. That report prompted an unidentified person to walk into the Waco police department and accuse Odiong of sexually assaulting her in 2012.\n\nA judge subsequently granted permission for police to access an email account belonging to Odiong and found messages from another woman who had not come forward, but explicitly detailed sexual encounters with the priest, including one which wounded her colon.\n\nBradley DeLange, a Waco detective, later spoke with the woman, who allegedly confirmed that Odiong had subjected her to some of the behavior his prior accusers had described.\n\nA judge then permitted police to search Odiong's iCloud data storage account. DeLange later wrote under oath he \"discovered images depicting a clearly prepubescent [disrobed] child\", which had been saved to the account in September 2020.\n\nDeLange said there were two more images of who is believed to be another child with someone who appears to be an adult touching an unclothed body part.\n\nWaco police secured a warrant to arrest Odiong and authorities took him into custody outside his home in Ave Maria, Florida, on Tuesday. That day, DeLange issued a statement through his department asking anyone else \"victimized by Anthony Odiong anywhere in the United States\" to come forward.\n\nAt least one new accuser had come forward by Thursday, setting the stage for the new sexual assault charges against Odiong.\n\nOdiong was ordained in the diocese of Uyo, Nigeria, in 1993. He was invited to work within the diocese of Austin, Texas, in 2006 by the then bishop Gregory Aymond. Odiong was then invited to work in Luling, Louisiana, in 2015, about six years after Aymond became the archbishop of nearby New Orleans.\n\nPlaces to which his assignments brought him over the years included the St Peter Catholic student center on the outskirts of Baylor University's campus in Waco as well as St Anthony of Padua in Luling.\n\nOdiong was able to build a loyal following in Texas and Louisiana largely by claiming to have a special understanding with the Virgin Mary through prayer. The charismatic clergyman would hold so-called healing masses after which some parishioners reported recovering from major medical ailments, improving church attendance as well as boosting his popularity with both congregants and diocesan officials.\n\nBut Odiong came under scrutiny after his various accusers came forward - including one who reported him to the sheriff's office in Luling, which said it could not determine any crime had been committed. The Austin diocese decided to prohibit Odiong from being able to minister in its region in 2019. Its counterparts in New Orleans waited until this past December to do the same.\n\nIn a statement after Tuesday's arrest, the New Orleans archdiocese made it a point to say the charges against Odiong \"stemmed from allegations reported in Waco\". But on Thursday, a source with direct knowledge of the investigation told the Guardian that at least one of the accusers involved in the sexual assault charges against Odiong was from the community of Luling, about 22 miles from the archdiocese of New Orleans.\n\nOdiong remained in custody in Florida late Thursday, jail records show. He had been ordered held without bail. It was not immediately clear when he may be transferred to Waco.\n\nAttempts to contact an attorney who has previously represented Odiong have been unsuccessful since Tuesday. Before his arrest, Odiong had posted an open letter on social media dismissing the allegations against him as \"a false, salacious, one-sided smear campaign\".\n\nIt remained to be seen Thursday whether Odiong's arrest would attract the attention of Louisiana state police troopers who served a search warrant on the archdiocese in April as part of an investigation into whether the church and its local leadership had operated as a child-sex trafficking ring responsible for \"widespread sexual abuse of minors dating back decades\" that was then \"covered up and not reported to law enforcement\".", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ramon_antonio_vargas@theguardian.com", "name": "Ramon Antonio Vargas", "type":

At the time, an unidentified woman who knew him since 2007 accused him of sexual and financial abuse.\n\nHer claim was referred to the St. Charles Parish Sheriff's Office by the archdiocese, after she said one of the instances happened in St. Charles. That encounter in 2019 appeared to be consensual, the Sheriff's Office said.\n\nOdiong went on to deny the allegations in a Facebook post in April of this year.\n\nThe priest wrote that the woman's allegations were \"false and defamatory,\" and accused her of retaliation. He added that he would pursue all legal remedies to \"clear his name,\" while continuing to serve God's people.\n\nPeople believed to be victimized by Odiong are encouraged to call Detective Bradley

According to sworn statements in support of the arrest warrant that were obtained by the Guardian, police said they discovered the illicit pictures while investigating complaints from at least four women that made officers aware Odiong, 55, could be \"a potential serial sexual assault suspect\".\n\nThe Waco police statements say that at least some of the women's complaints are too old to prosecute due to statutes of limitation. But the police said statutes of limitation in Texas are irrelevant if \"probable cause exists to believe that the defendant has committed the same or similar sex offense against five or more victims\". And they have asked anyone with information about Odiong to contact them as they weigh the possibility of charging him with the women's complaints.\n\nOdiong drew media scrutiny that eventually landed him on the police's radar in February, when the Roman Catholic diocese of Austin - which administers Waco's church institutions - revealed he was removed of his ability to minister there in 2019.\n\nThat revelation came nearly two months after Louisiana's most important diocese had similarly suspended him. The suspensions stemmed from complaints by women - including two he encountered while working at Baylor University in Waco - who publicly accused Odiong of trying to use his influence as a priest to pursue sexual contact they either did not welcome or could not consent to participating in.\n\nTexas is one of about a dozen states with a law that says it is impossible for there to be a consensual relationship between clergymen and adults who emotionally depend on their spiritual advice.\n\nAnd in March, less than a month after the Guardian published a report detailing how the prior allegations against him ranged from sexual coercion and groping to fiscal abuse, an unidentified person walked into the Waco police department and accused Odiong of sexually assaulting her in 2012.\n\nPolice subsequently secured judicial permission to access an email account belonging to Odiong and found messages from another woman who had never come forward explicitly detailing sexual encounters with the priest, including one where her colon was injured.\n\nInvestigators later spoke with the woman, who \"came forward to admit that\" she had met Odiong under \"the same circumstances\" and been subjected to some of the behavior his prior accusers had, according to the police's sworn statements.\n\nFrom there, a judge permitted police to search Odiong's iCloud online data storage account. Waco police detective Bradley DeLange later wrote under oath that he \"discovered images depicting a clearly prepubescent child in lewd exhibition of her ... vagina and pubic region\" which had been saved to the account in September 2020.\n\nDeLange said there were also \"two images of what is believed to be [another] child's breast\" with what appears to be an adult touching the unclothed body part.\n\nWhile none of the images show the face of a child, DeLange said it was evident that at least some of the images depicted someone \"under 10 years of age which ... may enhance the eligible punishment that may be assessed\".\n\nMcClennan county, Texas, judge Thomas C West on 5 July signed off on DeLange's request for a warrant to arrest Odiong in connection with the child abuse imagery, records show. The judge's suggested bail was $1m.\n\nAttempts to contact an attorney who has previously represented Odiong was not immediately successful.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when Odiong may be transferred to the custody of Waco police from Immokalee. He would be sentenced to at least 15 years in prison if eventually convicted of possessing child abuse imagery depicting a minor younger than 10.\n\nThe charges against Odiong are almost certain to revive questions about the way Catholic church bureaucrats have managed his career, which began with his ordination in Uyo in Nigeria, in 1993.\n\nWhen it suspended him from ministry in 2019, the Austin diocese did not disclose that move to the public - but later the organization assured congregants that it had provided notification to Catholic church leaders in south-east Louisiana, where Odiong was allowed to work until this past December.\n\nThat's when New Orleans' archdiocese declared that it had banned Odiong from ministering in its community, too. The archdiocese emphasized at the time that the allegations against Odiong exclusively involved adults - since May 2020, the institution has been in federal bankruptcy court trying to dispense of a mound of litigation associated with a decades-old clergy child molestation scandal.\n\nThe decision to remove Odiong from New Orleans's archdiocese was the responsibility of the city's archbishop, Gregory Aymond. As bishop of Austin in an earlier assignment, Aymond had invited Odiong to minister there beginning in 2006.\n\nAymond later became archbishop of New Orleans, and he invited Odiong to work there as well.\n\nOver the years in Texas and Louisiana, Odiong was tasked with working at Baylor's St Peter Catholic Student Center and at a church in Luling, Louisiana, south-west of New Orleans.\n\nHe was able to build a loyal following in the US in large part by claiming he had a special understanding with the Virgin Mary through prayer. The charismatic clergyman would hold so-called healing masses after which some parishioners reported recovering from major medical ailments, improving church attendance as well as boosting his popularity with both congregants and diocesan officials.\n\nBut cracks in the public image Odiong fostered began to form when one woman whom he encountered at Baylor reported him for making an unwanted sexual advance toward her shortly after she emerged from the sacrament of confession.\n\nA second woman whom Odiong met at Baylor then recounted how he pressured her to leave her troubled marriage and enter into a \"spiritual marriage\" with him, at one point forcefully kissing her on the mouth and groping her.\n\nA third woman from Pennsylvania who met Odiong while he studied for a master's degree in theology from Fransiscan University in Ohio alleged that he coerced her into an abusive, cross-state relationship from 2007 through 2018.\n\nShe said Odiong forced her to perform oral sex on him as well as give him significant sums of money. She said she could not consent to sexual activity with Odiong - or willingly give him money - because he was her spiritual adviser.\n\nThose three women all eventually told their stories to the Guardian as well as various church and law enforcement officials. In particular, the third of those women sought damages from New Orleans's archdiocese through its bankruptcy proceedings in 2021 while also reporting him to the sheriff's office which patrols Luling.\n\nA sheriff's office report obtained by the Guardian explains that the New Orleans archdiocese's general counsel, Susan Zeringue, claimed she was not even given the complaint in question to investigate until this past December. The sheriff's office ultimately concluded that there was not enough evidence to establish that a crime had occurred.\n\nNotably, unlike Texas, Louisiana does not automatically criminalize sexual contact between a clergyman and an adult parishioner - in the way it does, respectively, between teachers and students of age as well as corrections officers and incarcerated grown-ups, given the inherently imbalanced power dynamics at play.\n\nNonetheless, the New Orleans archdiocese revoked Odiong's permission to minister in its region at that point. And that expulsion garnered enough media attention to trigger the Waco police investigation which led to his arrest.\n\nWaco police have since sworn to have established Odiong would inflict sexually abusive acts against his accusers during private masses he celebrated with them or in sessions dedicated to spiritual counseling - all while \"wearing priest wardrobe items\". He would then communicate constantly with his accusers over email, Facebook and text messages, Waco police said in documents.\n\nThe case against Odiong is among multiple pending criminal matters with links to New Orleans' archdiocese.\n\nA prominent one centers on a search warrant that Louisiana state police served on the archdiocese in April as part of an investigation into whether the institution and its leaders had operated as a child-sex trafficking ring responsible for \"widespread sexual abuse of minors dating back decades\" that was \"covered up and not reported to law enforcement\".\n\nWhether Odiong's arrest attracts much interest from the Louisiana state troopers investigating the archdiocese with which he most recently worked remains to be seen.\n\nBut what Odiong has already made known is his defiance to the allegations against him.\n\nOdiong told his followers that Austin and New Orleans church officials had run him out over his opposition to Pope Francis's attempts to be more welcoming to LGBTQ+ people, who aren't allowed to marry within the Catholic church.\n\nHe also apparently ignored orders to return to his home diocese of Uyo and openly boasted about having plans to work at a Catholic university whose campus is about one mile away from the $400,000 home outside of which Odiong was arrested.\n\nOdiong was clad in clerical garb when authorities detained him Tuesday.\n\nHis most recent Facebook post was an open letter in which he accused the Guardian of carrying out \"a false, salacious, one-sided smear campaign\" against him. He also said he looked forward to pursuing \"any and all legal remedies\" to clear his name as well as to \"continue to faithfully serve God's people\".\n\nOdiong's post generated nearly 180 generally supportive comments, including one which implored Odiong to \"believe, in time, all things shall be revealed, all things shall be exposed\".\n\nThe Waco police detective investigating Odiong, DeLange, said anyone with information that may be helpful to him can reach him by telephone at (254) 750-7609.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors":

Until last year, for a several years Odiong had been pastor of St. Anthony's in Luling, in the Archdiocese of New Orleans. Although his home diocese technically is in Africa, Odiong had spent many years in the Diocese of Austin during the time of then-Bishop Gregory Aymond who when assuming the archbishopric of New Orleans eventually transferred Odiong there.\n\nOdiong in 2023 was removed from his position by the Archdiocese apparently on complaints from women about sexual improprieties as well as for financial irregularities attached to his ministry. Since then, he ignored his Nigerian bishop's call to return and instead holed up in an expensive home in Florida. He complained his removal, which included revoking his ministerial authority, was in response to his complaining that Church policy under Pope Francis was too lenient that validated homosexual liaisons.\n\nThat's weak. Former archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2 had to do everything but yank up Francis' robe in public to get himself excommunicated after years of increasingly deviationist rhetoric that began as valid criticism but ended up as renouncing Francis as legitimate pope. And years of defending traditional doctrine and practices oppositional to the Vatican's recent dictates didn't oust Bishop Joseph Strickland, previously heading the Diocese of Tyler but now without portfolio after being relieved of duties last year; only after he criticized directly Francis' role in what a number of the faithful perceive as undermining Church teachings did the Vatican act. One parish priest criticizing the confusion Francis has loosed with a recent pronunciation that clergy can non-sacramentally bless homosexual unions - which the whole of Africa rejected - isn't going to get anybody booted from pastoral duties, much less ministerial authority.\n\nIn fact, a long paper trail has emerged concerning Odiong's relationships with parishioners or others who relied upon him for spiritual leadership. As early as 2019 he was barred from ministry in the Diocese of Austin over \"behavior with adult women,\" four of whom now have come forward with complaints of sexual assault. The letter doing so, the diocese says, was transmitted to New Orleans. That archdiocese this week issued a statement concerning the arrest, but the statement did not acknowledge the earlier warnings from Austin or the reasons for his dismissal from the Luling congregation.\n\nSt. Charles Parish authorities were notified by one of the complainers. However, no arrest occurred because of insufficient evidence. The only reason the Waco warrant activated Florida police into the investigation that found the alleged child pornography was Texas law automatically criminalize sexual contact between a clergyman and an adult parishioner and relaxes the statute of limitations if the conduct is serial. And the Waco investigation was kickstarted by publicity from the Archdiocese's revocation of Odiong's priestly authority, which also seems to have occurred in his home diocese as well.\n\nToo little, too late. Aymond, with his connections to the Diocese of Austin certainly should have known, if not prior to inviting Odiong into the Archdiocese nearly a decade ago, about the complaints mounting against Odiong, and he certainly should have acted immediately after the Diocese had warned him. It continues a regrettable pattern with some Louisiana bishops who seem more concerned with opining about policy matters that they know little about that are little connected to their missions of moral instruction and guidance than in providing that moral leadership by ensuring the integrity of their shepherds and the safety of their flocks.\n\nBut the failings of individual bishops can be ameliorated by changes in Louisiana law that discourage cowardly approaches to dealing with predator clergy. One recent effort fell short when a 2021 law that opened a lookback window for prosecution of sex crimes - temporarily beyond 30 years past the age of majority - that the Louisiana Supreme Court found unconstitutional. However, there's no reason Louisiana can't adopt a law similar to Texas' that extends the same presumption of illegality of sexual contact between teachers and minor students as well as between corrections officers and incarcerated adults to clergy and their spiritual advisees.\n\nThat makes for a good start for next year's legislative session. It's right up the alley of a governor and Legislature who have proven in other ways they'll get tough on crime.", "source": {"uri": "thehayride.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hayride"},

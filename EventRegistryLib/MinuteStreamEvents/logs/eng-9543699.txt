It is also a record-beating Schreiner's past 24.50 sent this season.\n\nHowever, both finals would have left Schreiner in last place in the men's categories during the weekend's events, Fox added.\n\nSchreiner was born Camden Schreiner in New Jersey and competed as a boy at Hillsborough High School. There, he earned the 20th-best 100-meter time (11.72) for boys. That time, though, would have made him the leader in the girls category.\n\nDespite these results, Schreiner insists that he has no \"automatic advantage\" despite his biology.\n\n\"Out of all the hate that's been shared of me, 'cheater' is the most common word used...

The only way to make an educated decision on a small handful of athletes is to hear their voice, not speak for them.\"\n\nHis proclamations, though, do not take into account a growing number of studies that show that transgender therapies are not enough to take away advantages of a male body over a female body.\n\nMost of the rules put in place by sports organizations govern testosterone levels, but testosterone alone is far from the only difference between men and women where it affects sports.\n\nFor instance, researchers Emma N. Hilton and Tommy R. Lundberg published a study in Sports Medicine that found \"current evidence shows the biological advantage, most notably in terms of muscle mass and strength, conferred by male puberty and thus enjoyed by most transgender women is only minimally reduced when testosterone is suppressed as per current sporting guidelines for transgender athletes.\"\n\nThe authors of that study go on to say that transgender \"women\" have between a 10 and 50 percent advantage over women in sports, regardless of testosterone levels.\n\nA similar study by Timothy A Roberts, Joshua Smalley, and Dale Ahrendt, published by the British Journal of Sports Medicine, found that men who transition to women maintain some of their physical advantages over women despite all the medical tomfoolery of their \"transition.\"\n\nYet another study finds that muscle strength, size, and composition are still stronger in transgender women for at least a year after gender-affirming treatment.\n\nWomen's sports advocate Riley Gaines blasted the NCAA for Schreiner's success as a female track & field star.\n\n\"Sadie Schreiner, male competing with the women, won the women's 200 & 400m today at the Liberty League championship meet. He broke the 400m women's record in the process,\" Gaines wrote, adding, \"He would've finished last amongst the other boys by 2 full seconds.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "warner_todd_huston@breitbart.com", "name": "Warner Todd Huston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schreiner_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Schreiner University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rochester_Institute_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rochester Institute of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Testosterone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Camden, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsborough_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillsborough County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hillsborough County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/400_metres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "400 metres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_people_in_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender people in sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skeletal muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Collegiate Athletic Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Smoking", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Smoking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/05/Photo-and-Co_Getty-Images.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543699", "eventUri": "eng-9543699", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

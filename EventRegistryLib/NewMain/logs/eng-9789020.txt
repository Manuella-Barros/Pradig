They followed up a two-game home sweep of the NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers by losing 5-2 to the Rockies on Friday night.\n\nAfter being held to one run and one hit in six innings by rookie Tanner Gordon, the Padres broke through against reliever Peter Lambert (2-5) in the seventh.\n\nJake Cronenworth hit a leadoff single, Manny Machado doubled and Bogaerts singled to left to give the Padres a 2-1 lead. Rookie Jackson Merrill followed with a sacrifice fly.\n\n\"It started off the same. The guy was throwing good, a young guy, and got to the bullpen and got some guys on base,\" Bogaerts said. \"We started a nice rally once we got to the bullpen.\"\n\nRockies pinch hitter Jacob Stallings homered with one out in the eighth off All-Star Tanner Scott, who was making his Padres debut after being obtained from Miami on Tuesday. That snapped Scott's scoreless streak of 17 2/3 innings since June 17.\n\nP\u00e9rez held the Rockies to one run and three hits, struck out seven and walked none. His only big mistake was allowing Hunter Goodman's homer to left-center with one out in the third.\n\n\"It was awesome to go out there and do my job and we scored runs and we won the game,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"That's why I'm here. I'm here to help the team win.\n\n\"The support I have from my teammates is awesome,\" he added. \"It makes me feel comfortable and makes me feel like I was here before. That's really good and mentally I'm good. I think this is just the start. We've got to keep doing our things and we're going to have a good future for the last two months.\"\n\nIt was the first time this season the Padres started a left-hander, in their 112th game.\n\n\"Loved his pace, his control,\" manager Mike Shildt said. \"Good rhythm what he was doing. Everything was for quality strikes.\n\n\"It took a second to get adjusted to seeing a left-hander start a game,\" Shildt added. \"He was fantastic and very efficient.\"\n\nThe game took just 1 hour, 59 minutes.\n\n\"We were talking about the fifth or sixth, like we went back in time for a second,\" Shildt said. \"We had guys that were really working quick, hitting their spots.\"\n\nJason Adam (5-2) pitched the seventh for the win and Robert Suarez pitched the ninth for his 24th save.\n\nGordon, a 26-year-old rookie making his fourth start, was perfect through four innings. The Padres finally got baserunners when Gordon walked Machado leading off the fifth and allowed a single to Bogaerts. Merrill had a sacrifice bunt and David Peralta's groundout brought in Machado to tie it at 1.\n\nGordon came in at 0-3 with an 8.80 ERA. He made his big league debut July 7 against Kansas City at Coors Field. He was recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque earlier in the day.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRockies: DH Charlie Blackmon wasn't in the starting lineup a night after suffering a bruised left eye when an errant throw by Padres second baseman Xander Bogaerts hit his left wrist and face. He said he felt fine.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRockies RHP Cal Quantrill (7-7, 4.50 ERA) and Padres RHP Matt Waldron (6-9, 3.89 ERA) are scheduled to start Sunday's series finale. Quantrill was drafted by the Padres in 2016 and made his big league debut in 2019 before being sent to Cleveland in 2020 in the Mike Clevinger deal.", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType":

San Diego improved to an MLB-best 11-3 since the All-Star break.\n\nThe Rockies had the chance to clinch the season series, which they lead 6-4 with a three-game series remaining in Denver in two weeks. Colorado came into Sunday with the NL's worst record, 41-71.\n\nKnuckleballer Matt Waldron (7-9) pitched 5 2/3 strong innings, holding the Rockies to one run and two hits while striking out seven and walking two. He allowed Brenton Doyle's homer leading off the fourth, his 19th.\n\nHigashioka homered to left leading off the fifth, his 13th, to give San Diego a 2-1 lead against former Padres left-hander Cal Quantrill (7-8). Profar homered to right with one out, his 19th. It's one shy of his career high.\n\nThe Padres then blew it open in the sixth. Justin Lawrence, who relieved Quantrill with one out in the fifth, hit Xander Bogaerts with a pitch opening the inning and walked rookie Jackson Merrill. Peralta then homered to right, his third, for a 6-1 lead.\n\nPeralta got his glove above the wall in right to rob Hilliard of a homer leading off the fifth while Manny Machado and Jake Cronenworth each had two hits and two RBIs.\n\n\"I think both,\" Peralta said when asked whether it felt better to hit a homer or rob one. \"Anything to do to help the team is good, so today was a good game for the whole team. Great teams find a way to win and that's what we've been doing. We're going to continue to do that.\"\n\nHe said his big catch \"was tough a little bit, and then I was like, 'I'm going for it.'\"\n\n\"I think I hit the soft part of the wall because it was kind of tough. But it was good and I was happy I made the play for Waldron,\" Peralta said.\n\nSaid Waldron: \"It was incredible. I didn't know he hit it that far. I thought I got in there enough to get some weak contact, but unbelievable, especially the replay, that's awesome. I'm glad he did that.\"\n\nWaldron bounced back from a tough outing against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night, when he allowed five runs in the first inning of a game the Padres rallied to win 6-5 in 10 innings.\n\n\"My emphasis was definitely on the first inning,\" Waldron said. \"I wanted to come out ready to go a little bit better, just give our offense more of a chance and capture the momentum early. Ultimately, just trying to win, whatever that looks like.\"\n\nHe said his knuckleball \"felt great coming out of the hand. When I have a good release point going, it tends to be better, so I feel like that was going.\"\n\nThe Padres seemed poised for a big second inning against Quantrill but scored only one run, on Merrill's double to right-center. They stranded two runners.\n\nTo lead off the seventh for Colorado, Jacob Stallings homered off Adrian Morejon, his seventh.\n\nQuantrill allowed three runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings, walking three and striking out two.\n\nQuantrill was drafted by the Padres in 2016 and made his big-league debut in 2019 before being sent to Cleveland in 2020 in the Mike Clevinger deal.

They do know not if Joe Musgrove will truly round into form. They do not know how long Michael King can go like he has.\n\nFor at least a game, Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez looked like someone to rely on.\n\nThe 33-year-old veteran fired six strong innings in his debut with his new employer and the Padres' bats snapped out of their Rockies' trance in a 3-2 win on Saturday in front of a sellout crowd of 44,029 at Petco Park.\n\nThe victory snapped a five-game skid against the Rockies and was just the Padres' third win in nine games against Colorado, which entered the game with the second-worst record in the National League.\n\nThey fought tooth and nail to do it, too.\n\nA bunt from Jackson Merrill helped the Padres scratch across a run after Rockies rookie Tanner Gordon opened the game with four perfect innings.\n\nTwo innings later, Merrill's sacrifice fly to left capped a two-run rally for just enough cushion for the Padres' bullpen.\n\nJason Adam pitched a scoreless seventh, Tanner Scott allowed a home run to former Marlins teammate Jacob Stallings in his Padres debut and Robert Suarez preserved the one-run lead in the ninth.\n\nThe Padres had nothing to show for their first 12 at-bats against Gordon -- who had allowed six home runs through his first three starts in the majors -- when Manny Machado walked to start the fifth inning.\n\nXander Bogaerts followed with a single off third baseman Ryan McMahon's glove.\n\nThen, with his team down 1-0, Merrill sacrificed both runners over with a bunt, setting up David Peralta's game-tying groundout to second.\n\nGordon turned in another scoreless frame for the majors' worst pitching staff (5.46 ERA) before the Padres got to work on Colorado's bullpen.\n\nJake Cronenworth led off with a single, Machado dropped a soft double behind first base and Bogaerts gave the Padres a 2-1 lead with a sharp single to left, putting runners on the corners.\n\nMerrill's ensuing fly ball to the warning tracking in left proved to be useful insurance when Stallings' pinch-hit homer in the eighth snapped Scott's 172/3-inning scoreless streak.\n\nP\u00e9rez more than did his part in his Padres debut, tying a season high with seven strikeouts over six largely low-stress innings.\n\nHunter Goodman tagged P\u00e9rez for a home run with one out in the third inning. He gave up back-to-back, two-out singles in the fifth inning.\n\nAnd that's it, as P\u00e9rez had thrown just 80 pitches -- 60 strikes -- in handing a 1-1 game to the bullpen.\n\nWhile the 33-year-old P\u00e9rez had struggled as he returned from a groin injury in late June, he'd thrown six shutout innings in his last start before the trade deadline to encourage suitors to take a look.\n\nSaturday's start lowered P\u00e9rez's ERA to 4.96 on the season.\n\n\u00a92024 The San Diego Union-Tribune.

San Diego improved to an MLB-best 11-3 since the All-Star break.\n\nThe Rockies had the chance to clinch the season series, which they lead 6-4 with a three-game series remaining in Denver in two weeks. Colorado came into Sunday with the NL's worst record, 41-71.\n\nKnuckleballer Matt Waldron (7-9) pitched 5 2/3 strong innings, holding the Rockies to one run and two hits while striking out seven and walking two. He allowed Brenton Doyle's homer leading off the fourth, his 19th.\n\nHigashioka homered to left leading off the fifth, his 13th, to give San Diego a 2-1 lead against former Padres left-hander Cal Quantrill (7-8). Profar homered to right with one out, his 19th. It's one shy of his career high.\n\nThe Padres then blew it open in the sixth. Justin Lawrence, who relieved Quantrill with one out in the fifth, hit Xander Bogaerts with a pitch opening the inning and walked rookie Jackson Merrill. Peralta then homered to right, his third, for a 6-1 lead.\n\nPeralta got his glove above the wall in right to rob Hilliard of a homer leading off the fifth while Manny Machado and Jake Cronenworth each had two hits and two RBIs.\n\n\"I think both,\" Peralta said when asked whether it felt better to hit a homer or rob one. \"Anything to do to help the team is good, so today was a good game for the whole team. Great teams find a way to win and that's what we've been doing. We're going to continue to do that.\"\n\nHe said his big catch \"was tough a little bit, and then I was like, 'I'm going for it.'\"\n\n\"I think I hit the soft part of the wall because it was kind of tough. But it was good and I was happy I made the play for Waldron,\" Peralta said.\n\nSaid Waldron: \"It was incredible. I didn't know he hit it that far. I thought I got in there enough to get some weak contact, but unbelievable, especially the replay, that's awesome. I'm glad he did that.\"\n\nWaldron bounced back from a tough outing against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night, when he allowed five runs in the first inning of a game the Padres rallied to win 6-5 in 10 innings.\n\n\"My emphasis was definitely on the first inning,\" Waldron said. \"I wanted to come out ready to go a little bit better, just give our offense more of a chance and capture the momentum early. Ultimately, just trying to win, whatever that looks like.\"\n\nHe said his knuckleball \"felt great coming out of the hand. When I have a good release point going, it tends to be better, so I feel like that was going.\"\n\nThe Padres seemed poised for a big second inning against Quantrill but scored only one run, on Merrill's double to right-center. They stranded two runners.\n\nTo lead off the seventh for Colorado, Jacob Stallings homered off Adrian Morejon, his seventh.\n\nQuantrill allowed three runs and five hits in 4 1/3 innings, walking three and striking out two.\n\nQuantrill was drafted by the Padres in 2016 and made his big-league debut in 2019 before being sent to Cleveland in 2020 in the Mike Clevinger deal. Waldron was sent to the Padres in November 2020 as the player to be named in that deal.\n\nQuantrill was traded to Colorado in November.", "source": {"uri": "10news.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

We scored runs and we won the game. That's why I'm here. I'm here to help the team win ... and every five days I'm going to go out there and try to do my job to help the team win.\"\n\nSaturday's job was no small feat, even with the Rockies falling back to 30 games under .500.\n\nAfter all, Colorado had won five straight meetings and was looking to clinch the season series -- after just nine of 13 games played -- when rookie right-hander Tanner Gordon opened the game with four perfect innings.\n\nHere we go again?\n\nA decision to bunt in the fifth inning played a pivotal role in snapping the Padres out of their funk against the Rockies.\n\nManny Machado presented the Padres with their first base runner of the game with a leadoff walk and Xander Bogaerts followed with a single off third baseman Ryan McMahon's glove, setting up rookie Jackson Merrill to perhaps get the Padres rolling in a big inning.\n\nOnly one run was what mattered most at that point.\n\nSo Merrill made the decision to bunt the runners to second and third and David Peralta followed immediately with a groundball to second to create a whole new ballgame at 1-1.\n\nIt was the start the Padres needed.\n\nMerrill knew it as he walked up to the plate in the fifth inning.\n\n\"A lot of things went through my head going up,\" Merrill said. \"First and second. I saw the guy pretty well the first AB. I could hit him. I could do damage, but for me with the bullpen we have now, we get to that sixth inning, P\u00e9rez got us through six ... innings. Only one bad hit on us. If we get through that sixth and get a run and tie, you can see what our bullpen does. Keeps it really, really hard to get runs. ... I just thought if we could get a run across here it changes the whole game.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old rookie went on.\n\n\"And it's these guys too,\" he said. \"For some reason, we just can't get that final run or something to win. And they've been showing us. They've been showing us what they got all year. Just trying to do whatever I can to get a run across.\"\n\nTwo innings later, Merrill's sacrifice fly capped a two-run rally that provided just enough cushion for the revamped bullpen.\n\nJason Adam pitched a scoreless seventh. Tanner Scott allowed a home run to former Marlins teammate Jacob Stallings in his Padres debut. Then Robert Suarez preserved the one-run lead in the ninth with the help of first baseman Jake Cronenworth, who ventured into the baseline to reel in a throw from a whirling Manny Machado and tag out Brenton Doyle for the first out of the inning.\n\nAlmost like you'd draw it up after getting a lead, thanks to a rookie making a veteran decision.\n\nIt didn't surprise Padres manager Mike Shildt.\n\n\"Jackson knows the situation,\" Shildt said. \"He wants to make a baseball play. He knows we haven't scored. All right, this guy's throwing the ball pretty darn well ... and that's what playoff baseball is gonna be like.\n\n\"Today was like a playoff game in that regard. And that's what playoff games look like.\"\n\nAfter the Padres scored in the fifth, Gordon turned in another scoreless frame for the majors' worst pitching staff (5.46 ERA) before the Padres got to work on Colorado's bullpen.\n\nCronenworth led off with a single, Machado dropped a soft double behind first base and Bogaerts gave the Padres a 2-1 lead with a sharp single to left, putting runners on the corners.\n\nMerrill's ensuing fly ball to the warning tracking in left proved to be useful insurance when Stallings' pinch-hit homer in the eighth snapped Scott's 17\u2154-inning scoreless streak.\n\nP\u00e9rez more than did his part in his Padres debut, tying a season high with seven strikeouts over six largely low-stress innings.\n\nHunter Goodman tagged Perez for a home run with one out in the third inning.\n\nHe gave up back-to-back, two-out singles in the fifth inning.\n\nAnd that's it, as P\u00e9rez had thrown just 80 pitches -- 60 strikes -- in handing a 1-1 game to the bullpen.\n\nWhile the 33-year-old P\u00e9rez had struggled as he returned from a groin injury in late June, he'd thrown six shutout innings in his last start before the trade deadline to encourage suitors to take a look.\n\nSaturday's start lowered P\u00e9rez's ERA to 4.96 on the season.\n\n\"I'm good; I'm relaxed,\" P\u00e9rez said afterward. \"I think this is just the start. We're going to have a good future over the last two months.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Waldron was sent to the Padres in November 2020 as the player to be named in that deal.\n\nRockies: DH Charlie Blackmon wasn't in the lineup a second straight game with a bruised left eye after getting hit on the left wrist and face by an errant throw by Padres second baseman Xander Bogaerts on Friday night.\n\nPadres: Haven't announced their starter for Tuesday night when they open a series at the Pittsburgh Pirates.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Higashioka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Higashioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wily_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wily Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Clevinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Clevinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Blackmon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Blackmon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/86UWAkLY0aab0bPtVxReTQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/b7790a44659c3e01e1cff9b9d9234236", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-11-", "textStart": 1343, "textEnd": 1356}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Given how many high-impact relief arms they'd already acquired, at the time, the a move was almost an afterthought.\n\nMr. Perez, you have our attention.\n\nThe veteran lefty looked like he did when he was an All-Star in 2022, striking out seven and allowing just one run in 6.0 innings to help the Padres to a 3-2 win over the Rockies at Petco Park, the first time they've beaten Colorado at home this year.\n\nThe only run Perez allowed came on a solo home run by Hunter Goodman. The only other baserunners Perez allowed came on a pair of singles. It took a while for the Padres bats to get going against Rockies rookie Tanner Gordon. The rookie right-hander made his 4th career big league start and it was easily his best outing.\n\nGordon also allowed just one run in 6.0 innings of work so, with the game tied 1-1, it came down to the bullpens. This is where San Diego has the advantage.\n\nPeter Lambert came out for the 7th inning and immediately got himself in trouble. Jake Cronenworth, Manny Machado, and Xander Bogaerts greeted him with base hits, with Bogey's single bringing home Croney (credit manager Mike Shildt for the nicknames) and make it 2-1 San Diego. Machado would score on a Jackson Merrill sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.\n\nIn the 8th inning Tanner Scott, one of the prized pickups at the deadline, made his Padres debut. Perhaps it was nerves but the dominant lefty, who earlier in the day was named the National League Relief Pitcher of the Month for July (Dylan Cease won the award for starting pitchers), allowed a solo home run to Jacob Stallings to cut the lead to 3-2. It was just the 3rd homer Scott has allowed all year.\n\nLuckily there was another dominant arm ready to go for the 9th. Robert Suarez needed just nine pitches for a perfect inning and his 24th save of the year. The Padres can win the series on Sunday afternoon with Matt Waldron on the mound against former Friar Cal Quantrill.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lambert_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Lambert (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hunter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Hunter (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2165170324.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

He was then signed by the Padres and will now make his first start in the majors this season.\n\nCal Quantrill has shown signs of improvement in his recent outings. In his last start on July 19th against the Giants, he pitched 6 innings, allowing only 3 earned runs while striking out 5 batters. This performance helped lower his season ERA to 4.50, which is respectable considering he pitches half his games at Coors Field. Quantrill's ability to limit home runs (only 2 allowed in his last 4 starts) could be crucial against the Padres' power hitters.\n\nWhile the Rockies have struggled on the road this season, they still possess dangerous hitters who can break out at any time. Playing at Petco Park, which is more pitcher-friendly than Coors Field, might actually benefit some of Colorado's hitters by allowing them to focus on contact rather than trying to hit for power.\n\nCarl Edwards Jr. has not been a regular starter for the Padres this season. In fact, recent reports indicate he was released by the Cubs' Triple-A affiliate in March. If he's starting for the Padres, it likely means he's been recently called up or is being used as an opener. This uncertainty could work in the Rockies' favor, as Edwards may not be fully stretched out or acclimated to the major league level.\n\nThe Rockies' bullpen has shown flashes of effectiveness, as evidenced by Victor Vodnik's recent save against the Padres. If Quantrill can provide a quality start and hand the ball to a fresh bullpen, Colorado could have a recipe for success.\n\nThis game will likely come down to execution on the day. Quantrill will need to continue his recent form, the Rockies' offense must capitalize on scoring opportunities, and their bullpen will have to hold any lead they might secure. If these elements come together, the Rockies could indeed leave San Diego with a victory on Sunday.\n\nWhy The Padres Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nCarl Edwards Jr. has recently joined the Padres organization, signing a minor league contract in July. This fresh start could provide Edwards with renewed motivation and a chance to prove himself at the major league level. While he hasn't pitched in the majors in his career, his recent performance in Triple-A Iowa (1.85 ERA over 24.1 innings) suggests he still has effective stuff.\n\nPlaying at Petco Park gives the Padres a significant advantage. The ballpark is known for being pitcher-friendly, which could benefit Edwards and the Padres' pitching staff. Additionally, the Padres' familiarity with their home field could give their hitters an edge against Quantrill.\n\nCal Quantrill has had some inconsistent performances recently. In his last three starts, he's posted ERAs of 22.50, 3.60, and 4.50. This volatility could be exploited by the Padres' lineup, especially if Quantrill struggles with his command early in the game.\n\nHistorically, the Rockies have struggled on the road, particularly when transitioning from the high altitude of Coors Field to sea-level ballparks. This adjustment could work in the Padres' favor, potentially impacting the Rockies' offensive output.\n\nIf Edwards is indeed being used as an opener or in a limited role, the Padres' bullpen depth could be a deciding factor. The ability to mix and match relievers throughout the game could give the Padres an edge in neutralizing the Rockies' lineup.\n\nFinal Rockies-Padres Prediction & Pick\n\nIn Sunday's matchup, I predict the Padres will edge out the Rockies. Carl Edwards Jr., recently signed by the Padres, brings fresh motivation and has shown solid form in Triple-A. Petco Park's pitcher-friendly environment will likely benefit Edwards and the Padres' bullpen. Meanwhile, Cal Quantrill has been inconsistent in his recent starts, which the Padres' potent lineup, led by Manny Machado., could exploit. Additionally, the Rockies' historical struggles on the road further tilt the balance in favor of the Padres. Expect a close game, but the Padres' home-field advantage and offensive firepower should secure them the win.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Edwards", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carl Edwards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coors_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coors Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Power hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Edwards_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Edwards Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Win\u2013loss_record_(pitching)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Win\u2013loss record (pitching)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Europe", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Photography", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rockies-vs.-Padres-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-19", "textStart": 626, "textEnd": 635}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Every game is the same importance. You have to win each and every one of them. These guys, the way they've been playing against us has been very good, yes, but (Sunday) we have a game and can win a series. It started off with a loss but we can still try to win the series.\n\n\"If we win the series, then we're on a winning streak against them.\"\n\nThat would be ideal.\n\nSaturday's win, combined with losses by the Diamondbacks and Mets, thrust the Padres (60-52) from out of the playoff picture to in possession of the NL's second wild-card and just one game behind the Braves (60-50).\n\nZoom out a bit and there are six teams within four games of each other in the race for the NL's three wild-card spots.\n\nHere is how the Padres will line up for the series finale:\n\nAnd here is how the Rockies, who have been without Charlie Blackmon since he exited Friday after an errant Bogaerts throw caromed into his eye, will line up:\n\nThe 29-year-old former Padres first-rounder won't be a free agent until 2026, so the Rockies held onto him at the deadline. He allowed seven runs over 3\u2154 innings at the Angels on Tuesday.

No pedigrees. Front-runners. Languishers. Home and away. Early barrages and late comebacks. Pitching for days.\n\nThe Padres have found the type of footing that has allowed them to ignore records and street addresses and what's between their ears.\n\nThey're a blistering 11-3 since the break and have won five series in a row, the latest because of a 10-2 win Sunday against the Rockies at Petco Park.\n\n\"I think it's just business time now,\" said starting pitcher Matt Waldron, who got them two-thirds of the way through the sixth inning with two hits, seven strikeouts and two walks. \"Once that All-Star break hit, we all got the little fun or break we needed. It's time to go.\"\n\nThere does not need to be anything particularly pretty about a Rockies win for the Padres right now. As long as it's a win, given that the NL West basement bunch has won six of eight when the series sprouted wings.\n\nThey've hit: The .275 average is fifth best in the game with a second-best strikeout rate.\n\nThey've pitched and pitched and pitched: They stand No. 1 in hits allowed, 18 less than the next-up Twins as the day began. The team ERA and home runs allowed after the break are tied for the tops in baseball.\n\nThey're sprung few holes. They've bunted and lifted sacrifice flies when needed. They seem a team, a bigger and more sustainable thing than they've been in the past.\n\nThe Padres are inching forward, creating some cushion and building belief that finally has reached a routinely skeptical fan base.\n\n\"We've been pretty confident about what we're able to do and the way we're going about it,\" Padres manager Mike Shildt said of the season-long guidebook about playing consistently in all areas that is paying dividends now. \"I appreciate the dedication to that identity. We talk about that word, use it a lot, used it early on the first couple games of the season, about establishing it, showing it and then staying true to it.\n\n\"Sometimes the game doesn't reward you and you need to have some kind of identity to be able to hold onto and go back to. ... Once you strengthen it, it becomes more consistent.\"\n\nA sure sign of confidence swelling is when the wealth is shared. Six Padres finished with extra-base hits Sunday. Six drove in runs.The more instruments, the richer the song.\n\n\"Everyone's contributing, so I guess that makes it feel much better,\" said Xander Bogaerts, who singled twice and scored twice. \"It's not just one or two guys doing it. It just feels like everyone is contributing. That's a good feeling.\"\n\nThe three-run sixth inning began with Bogaerts being hit by a pitch. The three-run eighth? It began with a one-out walk to Kyle Higashioka.\n\nThe little things become big things. The wins pile up, too.\n\nThe Padres effectively have closed the wild-card gap, listed as tied for the top spot after the Braves lost Sunday. They sit a percentage point behind, but own the season tiebreaker.\n\n\"We've been able to do a lot of things very well consistently,\" Shildt said.\n\nBogaerts came around to the All-Star break thinking.\n\nComing into the pause, the veteran was hitting .231 with a .597 OPS. Now he stands at .423 across the last 14 games with a 1.033 OPS. He has nearly half of his season hits since the break in nearly a quarter of the at-bats.\n\n\"I was in a different situation. I was hurt,\" Bogaerts said. \"But the break can always be good for everyone, you know, as it seemed to be the case with me.\n\n\"Sometimes you want to do it so bad, so maybe a break is a good way to refresh and get you back on track.\"\n\nThe diversity of the wins and the ways the Padres have gone about it have made this stretch feel different and potentially significant.\n\nWheels can pop off, as they often do when teams think they have things figured out. The trade-deadline additions of relievers Tanner Scott and Jason Adam, along with another starter in Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez, buoy confidence, though.\n\nThe Padres also are closer to getting back All-Star right fielder Fernando Tatis Jr. and starter Joe Musgrove.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryce_miller@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Bryce Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Adam", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Adam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Scott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Scott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Tat\u00eds_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SUT-L-padres-0805-013.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

He retired the first 12 batters he faced, only gave up an infield single to Xander Boegarts in the bottom of the fifth inning and left after six superb innings.\n\nThe Rockies ended up losing 3-2, with their bullpen squandering Gordon's quality start, but Gordon will likely get a third straight start later this week without going back down to Class AAA.\n\n\"His ball was moving a little bit more than we thought -- a good sinker, good action on it,\" Bogaerts told reporters. \"We didn't really see that in the video. I think that was the pitch that got us. We thought it was straighter than that.\"\n\nGordon, who is still 0-3 on the season after Saturday night's no-decision, lowered his earned run average from 8.80 going into the start against the Padres to 6.75 after making his third road start of the season.\n\n\"It just came down to executing pitches and letting the guys behind me do the work,\" Gordon told reporters on Saturday night. \"Quality of strikes was the biggest thing and has been the biggest thing.\"\n\nPetco Park was the fourth MLB stadium Gordon has pitched in after he made his debut at Coors Field in Denver, then at Citi Field in New York against the Mets on July 12 and then at Oracle Park in San Francisco against the Giants on July 27.\n\nSaturday night's start was the third of the four the 6-foot-5, 215-pound Gordon has gone at least six innings. His start against the Mets only lasted three innings, with New York tagging him for six runs and hitting four home runs against him.\n\nHis perfect game bid against the Padres ended in the bottom of the fifth when he walked Machado on six pitches before Boegarts ended his no-hit effort with his infield single one batter later.\n\nMachado came around to score in the inning on an RBI groundout by David Peralta, but Gordon escaped any further damage that has plagued him in his previous three starts. His final inning on the mound in the bottom of the sixth saw him set down the Padres in order on just seven pitches.\n\nThe Rockies, who are in last place in the NL West and well out of the playoff picture, return home to Coors Field this week for a three-game series against the Mets from Tuesday through Thursday and then Friday through Sunday against the Braves.\n\nWith Saturday night's outing, it's likely Gordon will stick around instead of getting back sent down. In between his start against the Mets and against the Giants, Gordon made one start in the minors with Albquerque on July 21.\n\nFor now, though, he's got a chance to audition for Rockies manager Bud Black the rest of the season to see if he could materialize more into Colorado's plans for the 2025 season.\n\n\"He's in the mix as we move into the winter and into next year,\" Black told reporters. He's getting an opportunity. All players will tell you, 'Give me an opportunity in the Major Leagues to show what I can do.'\n\n\"And this is his opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "news-gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Then he put one over it.\n\nBoth feats play a key role in a 10-2 win over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday as the Padres won a fifth straight series since the All-Star break.\n\nThat romp includes trouncing playoff-bound teams in the Dodgers, Guardians and Orioles.\n\nA winning weekend against the NL's second-worst team was about exercising personal demons.\n\nThe Rockies, after all, had won five straight meetings before a dose of Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez and small ball snapped the Padres out of that funk on Saturday.\n\nMatt Waldron took the baton from there, throwing 5\u2153 strong innings against the backdrop of a trio of longballs.\n\nSolo shots from Kyle Higashioka and Jurickson Profar off Cal Quantrill (4\u2153 IP, 3 ER) gave the Padres a 3-1 lead in the fifth, a half-inning after Peralta's efforts in right field helped Waldron through a clean frame.\n\nIn the sixth, Justin Lawrence hit Xander Bogaerts and walked Jackson Merrill to open the inning. Peralta then yanked a 1-1 sinker over the wall in the wall in right -- the one he made sure that Hilliard didn't clear -- for a 6-1 lead, his third of the season and second in his last nine games.\n\nThe floodgates opened after Peralta's home run, with Manny Machado adding an RBI double in the seventh and Jake Cronenworth doubling in two in a three-run eighth.\n\nAfter a strong start from Waldron, Adri\u00e1n Morej\u00f3n allowed a home run to Jacob Stallings while giving the Padres four outs. Jeremiah Estrada threw a perfect eighth and Yuki Matsui got through the ninth unscathed.\n\nThe only mistake that Waldron paid for was Brenton Doyle's solo homer to tie the game at 1-1 in the fourth. Waldron struck out seven, scattered two walks, two hits and a hit batter while throwing 88 pitches over 5\u2154 innings.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_sanders@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Jeff Sanders", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "David Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wily_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wily Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Higashioka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Higashioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adri\u00e1n_Morej\u00f3n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adri\u00e1n Morej\u00f3n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Stallings", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Stallings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SUT-L-padres-0805-002.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports / Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe San Diego Padres host the Colorado Rockies on Sunday in the finale of their three game series. The Padres avenged Friday's loss with a 3-2 win Saturday, and San Diego will be able to win its first series against the Rockies this year.\n\nHere's everything else you need to know about the game:\n\nExpect a low-scoring affair as both teams are coming off weak offensive performances leading into the All-Star break. Matt Waldron (5-8, 3.71 ERA) and Tanner Bibee (7-4, 3.77 ERA) have been solid, though underappreciated, options for their respective teams. Given both teams' recent struggles at the plate, Waldron and Bibee could use today to lower their ERAs.\n\n* Jurickson Profar leads the charge for the Padres with a .305 batting average and 103 hits, rounding out with 14 home runs and 59 RBIs.\n\n* The Guardians' offensive leans heavily on Jose Ramirez, who leads his team with 23 home runs and 77 RBIs, not to mention his standout 100 hits this season.\n\n* Padres hitters finished the first half leading all of MLB in hits (876), and rank first in the National League in batting average (.261). It's the 1st time in Padres' club history in which they led the Majors in hits prior to the ASG, and it's just the 2nd time they led the NL in average (only other time was 1992 at .263).\n\nExpect a low-scoring affair as both teams are coming off weak offensive performances leading into the All-Star break.

Starting pitcher Matt Waldron (6-9, 3.89 ERA) has been more consistent of late this season, and his knuckleball has given the Rockies difficulty in the past. Despite Cal Quantrill's respectable season stats (7-7, 4.50 ERA, 90 strikeouts) for Colorado, he is up against a San Diego lineup that has found ways to win of late. An early lead should be enough for Waldron and the Padres' bullpen to handle against a struggling Rockies team.\n\n* The Padres are 13-12 in one-run games this year, 44-11 when scoring first.\n\n* Waldron is tied with Michael King for the most quality starts by a Padres pitcher this year.\n\n* Since the All-Star break, Padres pitchers have the best record in baseball and lead the NL in ERA, opponent average, opponent OPS, and WHIP.\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanner_Bibee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanner Bibee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckleball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knuckleball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2647,h_1488,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_padres/01j4faz3pgsnq763mbyb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This situation was one of the biggest situations I've ever been in.\"\n\nThe Padres tied it in the ninth on home runs by Manny Machado, who connected on Blake Treinen's first pitch, and a high-arcing shot to right with one out by rookie Jackson Merrill. Machado also homered off starter Tyler Glasnow in the second.\n\nIt was Machado's 41st career multi-homer game.\n\nSan Diego loaded the bases against Alex Vesia,(1-3) who's from suburban Alpine, before Solano's big hit against a drawn-in infield.\n\nSolano, a right-handed hitter, was pinch-hitting for left-handed hitter Jake Cronenworth against the lefty Vesia.\n\n\"It's an opportunity. I was a little surprised, but I was ready for any situation,\" Solano said. \"The manager makes the decision and I'm ready for that.\"\n\nManager Mike Shildt said Cronenworth has had \"a great year for us, one of our main guys, but the situation just presented itself. We've got a guy over there in Solano with a professional at-bat on display there.\"\n\nShildt said Cronenworth \"stood right beside me and cheered his tail off for Donny and he rewarded us with a real quality at-bat and brought it home for us.\"\n\nIt was the 25th comeback win of the season for the Padres, who are 3-1 in extra innings, while the Dodgers are 7-5.\n\nRobert Suarez (6-1) pitched a perfect 10th for the win.\n\nThe Dodgers had taken a 5-0 lead in the first inning, capped by rookie Cavan Biggio's two-run home run off the right-field foul pole with two outs.\n\nBut the Padres began their comeback with Machado's leadoff homer off Glasnow in the second and two runs on three straight two-out hits in the third.\n\nThe Dodgers came into the night with a 6 1/2-game lead over the Padres, who were clinging to the third NL wild-card spot. San Diego had gone 7-2 on a three-city trip after the All-Star break.\n\nEarlier, Los Angeles obtained right-hander Jack Flaherty from Detroit and four-time Gold Glove Award-winning center fielder Kevin Kiermaier from Toronto just before the trade deadline.\n\nThe Padres added to their already strong bullpen by acquiring All-Star left-hander Tanner Scott and right-hander Bryan Hoeing from the Miami Marlins for four prospects.\n\nThe Dodgers, who lost three of their previous five games, wasted no time jumping on knuckleballer Matt Waldron.\n\nShohei Ohtani drew a leadoff walk, stole second, advanced on Will Smith's single and scored on Gavin Lux's sacrifice fly. After Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez struck out, Waldron allowed a double to Jason Heyward, a two-run single to Andy Pages and Biggio's homer, which bounced off the pole and hit right fielder David Peralta in the stomach. It was Biggio's fifth.\n\nGlasnow allowed three runs and six hits in seven innings, struck out eight and walked one.\n\nMachado homered leading off the second. Jurickson Profar hit an RBI single and Jake Cronenworth an RBI double in the third.\n\nWaldron allowed five runs and five hits in four innings, struck out six and walked one.\n\nMachado, the third baseman, made two nice plays in foul territory, including leaning over the railing in front of the Dodgers' dugout in the fourth to catch Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez's foul ball while blowing a bubble. He leaned against the railing for a few seconds and chatted with Teoscar Hernandez, who jokingly tried to grab the ball.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPadres: RF Fernando Tatis, on the IL with a stress reaction in his right thighbone, has started hitting and playing catch. GM A.J. Preller said Tatis is expected to return sometime this season.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nDodgers LHP Clayton Kershaw (0-0, 4.50) is scheduled for his second start after making his season debut on Thursday. He'll oppose Padres RHP Dylan Cease (10-8, 3.50), who threw his first career no-hitter and the second in San Diego history on Thursday at Washington.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source":

As we've seen all season long you can't keep this offense down for very long.\n\nThe Friars pounded out a trio of home runs and had seven extra-base hits in a 10-2 win over Colorado, giving San Diego their first series win in three tries this year against their division foes.\n\nMatt Waldron got the start and was very, very good. The knuckleballing right-hander gave up one run and struck out seven in 5.2 innings to get his 7th win of the year and he got by with a little help from his friends with gloves.\n\nIn the 5th inning Sam Hilliard hit a long fly ball to right field. It looked like it was headed for the bleachers but David Peralta made a tremendous leaping grab to bring the ball back in the yard for a long, loud out. That play seemed to inject a little life into the entire lineup.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning catcher Kyle Higashioka ambushed the first pitch he saw from former Friar Cal Quantrill, lifting it over the left field wall for a solo homer, his career-high 13th homer of the season. Higgy also has 34 RBI, tying his career-best. He had barely caught his breath when the Padres scored again.\n\nTwo batters later Jurickson Profar unloaded on a solo blast to right field. The All-Star took a few steps down the line and tossed his bat triumphantly into the air before taking off on a home run trot. But the Friars put the game away an inning later in what will forever be called \"The David Peralta Game.\"\n\nWith two runners on the veteran lefty hit a missile into the right field bleachers, his 3rd homer of the season, to give the Padres a 6-1 lead.\n\nIn the 8th inning they decided to do some stat padding. Jake Cronenworth laced a bases loaded double down the right field line to bring home two runs and Manny Machado singled home Profar to put the Padres into double digits in the run column.\n\nSan Diego has gone 11-3 since the All-Star break to stay in the extremely muddled National League Wild Card hunt. With the win the Padres have tied the Braves for the 4th seed but they have a ton of company. The Diamondbacks are a half game back and in control of the 6th seed while the Mets, Cardinals, Pirates, and Giants are all within 5.0 games of a playoff spot.\n\nSpeaking of the Pirates, they host the Padres for a 3-game series starting Tuesday at PNC Park.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Hilliard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Hilliard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Higashioka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Higashioka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Quantrill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cal Quantrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNC_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PNC Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2024/08/GettyImages-2165285630.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9789020", "eventUri": "eng-9789020", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

They acquired Rays right-handed reliever Jason Adam, Marlins relievers Tanner Scott and Bryan Hoeing, as well as Pirates starter Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez, which helped take the burden off their bullpen.\n\nBased on their early usage, Adam will most likely be the seventh inning set-up reliever for the Padres, with Scott and Robert Suarez closing out games. Suarez got the save Saturday, his only appearance since Scott was added to the roster.\n\nThe moves could have the effect of boosting the Padres to a deep playoff run, one their players and fans are hungry for. The NL West is a tough division but San Diego's recent acquisitions might be exactly what the team needed to put them on top.\n\nNow that the club arguably has the best group of high-leverage arms, it wouldn't be surprising to see the Padres dominate in the postseason.\n\nThis move couldn't come at a better time since San Diego is closing in on the division race already and now with a supplemented bullpen, they're even stronger.\n\nAmong all San Diego relievers who had thrown at least five innings in the month of July, Jeremiah Estrada (1.46 ERA in 12.1 innings), Suarez (2.79 ERA in 9.2 innings), southpaw Yuki Matsui (2.89 ERA in 9.1 innings) and Adrian Morejon (3.12 ERA in 8.2 innings) all have ERAs under 4.00\n\nThe four who didn't -- Logan Gillaspie (4.76), Enyel De Los Santos (7.71), Stephen Kolek (8.22) and Austin Davis (12.60) -- were either traded, released, optioned to the minors or placed on the injured list. What remains is as strong a bullpen as any in MLB.\n\nPresident of baseball operations A.J. Preller was a busy man this week but, as infielder Jake Cronenworth shared, players were expecting Preller to come through with some big moves.\n\n\"Not surprised, per usual,\" Cronenworth told Kevin Acee of The San Diego Tribune. \"I think everybody at this point knows he's going to try to do something big.\"\n\nPreller was able to add key relievers for the Padres, which could get them over the hump of NL West opponents.\n\n\"I think probably one of the bigger things is the way that the team has played,\" Preller said. \"Obviously, there have been some ups and downs and some hot and cold stretches, etcetera. But we have a lot of guys playing really well in terms of the depth of our lineup, our roster ... like the style of ball, seeing some guys have some really good years.\n\n\"I just think it was like, 'Hey, we feel like we have a team that can compete and win.' I think that was more of it than looking at last year's team. We felt like should have gone to the playoffs and didn't. But I don't think it's like a reaction to that.

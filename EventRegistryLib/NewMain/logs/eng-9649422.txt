Theirs has been a calm, slow and comfortable love - unlike anything we have seen from the Bridgerton siblings' love stories so far.\n\nAnd yet, when Francesca finally got to kiss her new husband John after their vows, a look of confusion - perhaps even disappointment - seemed to flicker across her face.\n\nWas there something missing, as Francesca's mother had feared all along?\n\nA word of warning, gentle reader, as we're about to delve into possible spoiler territory from this point - drawing from the source material of Julia Quinn's novels as well as potential Bridgerton season-four plot.\n\nSure enough, Francesca Bridgerton and John Stirling did fall in love in the books - however their story was to be cut tragically short, with John dying in his sleep a few years later.\n\nBut this is where things could get really interesting for Netflix's adaptation (RIP John).\n\nIn the novels, John does indeed have a cousin - only he is called Michael Stirling.\n\nJohn's cousin would be in love with Francesca from the very moment he met her, but only ever acting on his feelings as a confidant and supportive friend. Some time after John's death however, Francesca ended up falling in love with Michael too and they wound up getting married.\n\nIf you've not yet connected the very clear dots, Bridgerton's decision to introduce a female Stirling cousin invites us to assume that we will finally be getting a central queer romance on the show.\n\nMichaela and Francesca's initial on-screen introduction also suggests that the show will be switching the initial feelings; let's not pretend that Francesca wasn't clearly in awe of John's beautiful cousin Michaela.\n\n\"I caution you,\" Michaela teased upon meeting her. \"Every sordid detail John has spoken about me is a lie... The truth is far worse.\"\n\nAn enamoured Francesca struggled to even muster up her own name in response, also conveniently forgetting for a moment that she's now a Kilmartin and no longer holds her maiden name of Bridgerton.\n\nMichaela and Francesca's meet-cute mirrored the picture that Lady Violet Bridgerton had painted of her own first meeting with Francesca's father, where she could \"barely speak my own name\" because she had been \"so taken by him.\"\n\nThis was the Bridgerton matriarch's precedent for a passionate and enduring love, against which Violet measured all of her children's relationships. She had worried it wasn't there for Francesca with John, but every love is different and she hadn't seen Francesca with Michaela just yet.\n\nWith Michaela set to accompany the newlyweds to Scotland (with an adventure-seeking Eloise also in tow) we have every reason to believe that Francesca and Michaela's storyline will continue into season four.\n\nLet's also not forget that the Netflix show has finally given space for Benedict Bridgerton to explore his bisexuality in a meaningful way, so it's a great time to be a Bridgerton fan.", "source": {"uri": "digitalspy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Spy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/masali-baduza-bridgerton-season-3-part-2-666ac2419f4ca.jpg?crop=0.978125xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Francesca's Love Story Takes A Queer Turn In 'Bridgerton'", "body": "In the Season 3 finale of Bridgerton, the Netflix series has unveiled a significant twist in Francesca's love story. Who is Michaela Stirling, and what does her character mean for Francesca's romance moving forward?\n\nIn the TV series, Francesca (played by Hannah Dodd) makes her societal debut in Season 3 upon returning from Bath. She differs from the other debutantes because she shows little interest in meeting suitors. Because she is not seeking attention, the Queen names Francesca her \"sparkler\" and introduces her to the prestigious Lord Samadani.\n\nSamadani is simply a logical match, so her heart skips when she meets John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli), at the Innovations ball. John is a kind gentleman who shares her love for quiet. In Episode 4, he gifts Francesca a piece of sheet music rearranged to her specific liking.\n\n\"He [John] was quite different, to say, Mr. Samadani and some other characters that we saw earlier in part one,\" says Victor Alli, who plays John, in an interview with Forbes. \"He is very sure of himself. Despite his shyness, he's quite confident and doesn't feel he needs to prove anything or try to change.\"\n\nTheir relationship grows even stronger in the second part of Bridgerton Season 3. John continues to court Francesca, and they get to know each other more. Finally, the couple announces their engagement, rather quickly, so they can marry and retreat peacefully to John's estate in Scotland.\n\nWhile the Bridgertons are excited about the match, Lady Bridgerton still has concerns. Their love story is not a whirlwind of passion like her other children have experienced. Instead, their romance is subtle and delicate, matching their reserved personalities. Violet delays asking the Queen for their permission to marry, which frustrates Francesca.\n\nFrancesca is forced to come clean about their engagement when the Queen suspects that someone in the Bridgerton family is Lady Whistledown. Queen Charlotte tells the couple they do not need her permission to marry. Francesca and John tie the knot in an intimate ceremony, and afterward, they announce their plans to leave Mayfair for Scotland. Eloise asks to join them on their travels so she can start to explore the world beyond the ton.\n\nBut before they leave, viewers meet Lord Kilmartin's cousin, who will play a major role in Francesca's season.\n\nIn the final episode of Season 3, \"Into The Light,\" John Stirling introduces Francesca and Eloise to his cousin, Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza), at the Dankworth-Finch ball. When Francesca meets Michaela, an instant spark of chemistry leaves Francesca speechless. \"I caution you. Every sordid detail John has spoken about me is a lie,\" Michaela says to Francesca. \"The truth is far worse.\"\n\nThis surprise twist paves the way for Francesca to have a relationship with Michaela in a future season of Bridgerton, marking the first time a queer romance will take center stage in the Netflix series.\n\n\"It will take a lot of people by surprise,\" Alli says about Michaela. \"I remember Jess Brownell on a Zoom call and she was telling me and I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!'\" Alli added that the showrunner and the Bridgerton team have made \"some really strong decisions\" from season one until now, and he's excited for Michaela to come \"into this world.\"\n\n\"I had an amazing welcome into the ton and the cast, and absolutely she will get that as well. I'm really excited for her to come on board and show everyone how incredible she is,\" he continued.\n\nAfter Season 3, part one, was released in May, some fans theorized on X and debated in a Reddit thread that Francesca could be gay. \"did they make francesca gay on bridgerton??? or am i just reading into things? pls tell me if you got the same vibes,\" one X user wrote.\n\nMichaela's introduction comes after series showrunner Jess Brownell previously told Pride that she wanted to incorporate more LGBTQ+ storylines in the show.\n\n\"I want to see more queer joy on my screens and that was definitely a priority for me when I stepped into the showrunner role,\" she said. \"How exactly that plays out over this season and the next couple seasons, I can't say specifically, but I will say I'm excited for fans to see that.\"\n\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for the sixth book in the Bridgerton series, \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\nIn Julia Quinn's book, \"When He Was Wicked,\" John's cousin is a man named Michael Stirling. The book begins with Francesca and John, married and in love, living in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Kilmartin. They both share a close bond with Michael.\n\nTragically, John dies two years later from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, leaving Francesca a widow. Michael becomes the new earl and flees to India out of grief. Upon his return four years later, Francesca desires a child and wishes to remarry. Michael, who has secretly harbored feelings for Francesca, realizes he wants to be more than just friends, and they eventually fall in love and have children.\n\nIt's currently unknown how Michaela and Francesca's future romance will play out in Bridgerton and which future season will highlight Francesca's love story.

Bridgerton Book Change & Francesca's Future Explained", "body": "This article contains spoilers for Bridgerton season 3 and Julia Quinn's Bridgerton novels.\n\nSummary\n\nMichaela Stirling's brief appearances in Bridgerton hint at a larger role in Francesca's story. Michaela is a stand-in for Julia Quinn's Michael Stirling. Masali Baduza's portrayal of Michaela Stirling adds an exciting LGBTQ+ representation to Bridgerton.\n\nThe last episode of Bridgerton season 3 resolved many plotlines, but also jump-started completely new ones, such as the story of Michaela Stirling. Michaela only makes two brief appearances in the season, yet Julia Quinn's writings hint that she will play a far larger role later in the series. The appearance of Michaela may seem unassuming, but her introduction hints at the start of a brand-new chapter, both for Bridgerton season 4, and for Francesca.\n\nNotably, Michaela Stirling's introduction came at a time of great change for Francesca. After playing a very minor role in past Bridgerton seasons, she finally earned a bespoke storyline in season 3. Her new plot was a whirlwind. Francesca went from entering the ton for the first time in episode 1 to leaving for Scotland with her new husband in episode 8. Overall, Francesca has been through a lot in a short period of time. Michaela will likely only add to this. In fact, if Netflix stays true to Julia Quinn's Bridgerton books, Michaela will be at the center of Francesca's life changes.\n\nRelated\n\nBridgerton Season 3 New Cast & Returning Character Guide\n\nThe third season of Netflix's Bridgerton brings a mixture of characters that audiences know and love, and brand new faces to learn more about.\n\nMichaela Stirling Is A New Bridgerton Character\n\nMichaela Is John's Cousin\n\nWhen she first appears on-screen at the Dankworth-Finch ball, Michaela Stirling is introduced as John Stirling's cousin. It is revealed that she will be accompanying Francesca and John to Scotland, along with Eloise. From the start, it is clear that Michaela is a charismatic yet perhaps dangerous person. Her first line is \"Every sordid detail John has told you about me is a lie. The truth is far worse.\" Then, she boldly asks Francesca to introduce herself, leaving the sixth Bridgerton sibling floundering for words.\n\nAlthough Michaela seems charming, she may be hiding some dark or irresponsible behavior.\n\nBased on her introduction, some theories can be made about Michaela's upcoming role in Bridgerton. First and foremost, Michaela's opening line says a lot about her personality. If she assumes that John would reveal \"sordid details\" about her, then there must be some truth to these rumors. This is almost confirmed when she confidently claims the truth is much worse. Although Michaela seems charming, she may be hiding some dark or irresponsible behavior, at least by society's standards. Francesca's speechless awe hints that she will likely want to learn more about Michaela in the near future.\n\nMichaela Stirling Will Replace 1 Very Important Bridgerton Character\n\nMichaela Stirling Likely Represents Michael Stirling\n\nClose\n\nThe following section includes spoilers for Julia Quinn's \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\nWith the help of Julia Quinn's book When He Was Wicked, Michaela Stirling's role in Bridgerton becomes clear. Based on her name, Michaela is likely to take the place of the book character, Michael Stirling. Like Michaela, Michael is John Stirling's cousin. He is first introduced, on the page, at a supper celebrating Francesca and John's imminent marriage. Most importantly though, Michael is the man Francesca is destined to marry after John tragically passes away. Seemingly, Michaela will take on this role during Francesca's upcoming season.\n\nEvery Bridgerton Book In Order\n\nWhich Bridgerton Sibling It Follows\n\nThe Duke and I\n\nDaphne\n\nThe Viscount Who Loved Me\n\nAnthony\n\nAn Offer From a Gentleman\n\nBenedict\n\nRomancing Mister Bridgerton\n\nColin\n\nTo Sir Phillip, With Love\n\nEloise\n\nWhen He Was Wicked\n\nFrancesca\n\nIt's In His Kiss\n\nHyacinth\n\nOn the Way to the Wedding\n\nGregory\n\nAlthough Michaela and Francesca's romance may seem surprising, it has already been hinted at in Bridgerton season 3.

This reaction harks back to an earlier conversation where Violet revealed that she could barely speak to Francesca's father when they first met. Violet acknowledges that Francesca doesn't act like that with John, but perhaps their love is simply different. Now, however, it seems that Francesca has found that breathless, speechless kind of love with Michaela.\n\nWho Plays Michaela Stirling In Bridgerton\n\nMasali Baduza Is Michaela Stirling\n\nMichaela Stirling is played by South African actress, Masali Baduza. Born in East London, South Africa, Baduza has been acting since 2017. Her career began on the stage, but she soon picked up notable on-screen roles. Her first project was 2019's Trackers. In 2020, she earned her breakout role as Sephy Hadley in the drama series, Noughts + Crosses. Since then, she has appeared in The Woman King, and now, Bridgerton. If Baduza stays in her role as Michaela Stirling, it is likely that Bridgerton viewers will see a lot more of her in the show's future.\n\nOverall, the introduction of Masali Baduza as Michaela Stirling is incredibly exciting for Bridgerton. Bringing Michaela onto the scene hints that Francesca's love story is forthcoming. Even if Bridgerton season 4 isn't her season, her story could still play out in season 5. Additionally, Baduza's casting represents a major and exciting Bridgerton book change. Making Francesca's love story into an LGBTQ+ relationship adds a new layer of interest and representation to Bridgerton. Ultimately, the future looks bright for Bridgerton, and Michaela Stirling will only heighten anticipation for what's ahead.\n\nBridgerton\n\nRomance\n\nDrama\n\nWhere to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nFrom Shondaland and creator Chris Van Dusen, Netflix's Bridgerton is based on the romance novels of the same name by author Julia Quinn.

John's cousin Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza) is in attendance and literally takes Francesca's breath away. Francesca is so stunned by Michaela's beauty that she forgets her own name. Talk about a meet cute!\n\nBut, wait...aren't Francesca and John paired up? Well, yes, but in the books (and again, big spoilers ahead, now for future seasons) John later passes away. Francesca ultimately remarries with his cousin Michael Stirling. Now, that cousin has become Michaela. Although this twist isn't totally official yet -- Francesca and Michaela haven't sealed the deal -- this does seem to signal the first official queer main couple on the show.\n\nShowrunner Jess Brownell did clarify what's going on with Francesca's upcoming marriage to John. In an interview with Glamour, Brownell stated that Francesca does love John, meaning that she's most likely bisexual.\n\n\"I just want to say that I don't think that the reveal of Francesca's future queerness negates what she has with John,\" Brownell said. \"I personally don't believe in a hierarchy of relationships. Every relationship is different, and lots of different kinds of love are valid. The kind of love she has for John is very real.\"\n\nThe decision to gender-bend Francesca's love interest has paid off. The Bridgerton fans chimed in early on Thursday morning to celebrate Michaela's first appearance, especially elated at how lovestruck Francesca was at the ladies' first meeting.\n\nWhile most fans are enthusiastic about this change, there will be naysayers. In light of that, the Bridgerton community has already rallied behind Francesca and Michaela, ensuring that they'll take down bullies and homophobes online.\n\nSome viewers, however, are such fans of the books that they're unhappy to see such a major change to Francesca's storyline. One Bridgerton viewer slammed the show for scrapping Francesca's infertility plot for \"gay inclusivity.\" They continued, \"It's not homophobic, it's a CRIME.\"\n\nWell, no, as of 2024, being queer isn't \"a crime.\" It's delightful to see both Francesca and Benedict's characters have new identities in the serial adaptation of Bridgerton, even if it is a big change for their storylines. We shouldn't be forcing characters into their straight plots when so many viewers yearn for queer love interests -- and especially not during pride month!", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Coughlan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Coughlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_pride", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT pride"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long_Distance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Long Distance", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2025,w_3600,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1718294673/BRIDGERTON_201_Unit_05754R.jpg_BRIDGERTON_201_Unit_05754R_elmsw0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

The happy couple are off to Scotland with Eloise in tow, and the seeds for a future season could have easily quit being sown there. John, however, simply had to introduce his cousin Michaela to the Bridgerton girls before they departed, and suffice to say that if John gave Francesca butterflies, than Michaela is giving her bald eagles.\n\nAnd yes, that educated guess goes far beyond the nervous, stutter-laden disposition that Francesca adopted when she first met Michaela.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Michaela Stirling (portrayed by Masali Baduza) is the cousin of Francesca's new husband John, who will be staying with the couple at the Kilmartin Estate for the time being. Her name is also remarkably close to the name Michael, and there's a reason for that.\n\nIn the 2004 Julia Quinn novel \"When He Was Wicked,\" Francesca \u23e4 the leading Bridgerton sibling of that story \u23e4 is married to John, only for him to succumb to an illness some time during their marriage. This is a sad event, of course, but there's a silver lining for one Michael Stirling, the cousin of John and successor to the Earl of Kilmartin title; Francesca, who he's loved since the moment he first laid eyes on her, is single again.\n\nThe implications here are about as subtle as Queen Charlotte's attire; with Michaela acting as the stand-in for the character that Francesca falls in love with in the novels, to say nothing of how drastically smitten Francesca clearly was upon their introduction, it doesn't take a detective to conclude that Francesca's Bridgerton story, whenever we get it, is going to be a queer one of sorts.\n\nThe stage for such a story has been set from the get-go. In the time we've spent with Francesca thus far, she's mostly been defined by how differently she feels \u23e4 and nebulously so \u23e4 about occupying space in society and approaching love. Indeed, it will be no complicated task to use Francesca as a springboard for a queer love story, even if the exact beats will no doubt end up surprising us.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "charlotte_simmons@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Charlotte Simmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_eagle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bald eagle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detective_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detective fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Marriage", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/michaela-stirling-bridgerton.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

The Show Made A Drastic Change for This Beloved Book Character", "body": "With the final part of season 3 of Bridgerton finally upon us, a new character has entered the throes of regency. Here's who Michaela Stirling really is, and why book fans are ready to see Francesca's love story finally coming to light.\n\nIn the opening of season 3 of the hit Netflix series, Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) makes her debut into society and finds a suitor. Queen Charlotte doesn't find a diamond of the season, but Francesca focuses on John Stirling (Victor Alli), a quiet man she's fond of playing piano with. He gives her a piece of sheet music signaling a quiet act of service to her, and the two eventually marry by the end of the season. He introduces her to Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza), and the book lovers know that it hints at a greater love story that could be explored in future seasons.\n\nMichaela Stirling is John's cousin. The TV show gender-bent the character to be a woman since the character was written to be Michael in the books. The show foreshadows their upcoming love story when Michaela tells Francesca as they journey on to Scotland, \"Every sordid detail John has told you about me is a lie. The truth is far worse.\"\n\nAfter reading Francesca's book When He Was Wicked, showrunner Jess Brownell immediately wanted to focus on a queer love story for Francesca's arc. \"I really related to it as a queer woman,\" she told Glamour. \"Her book talks a lot about how different she feels, and I think Julia Quinn's intention in the book is just that Fran feels different because she's introverted. But for many of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different is a part of our stories. I felt like there was fertile ground thematically in her book to nod toward telling a queer story. There are also some elements of her story that allow us to make sure we can tell a pretty happy ending for Francesca and Michaela. It was important for me in telling a main queer story for us to be able to give them a happily ever after, as we have with every other couple.\"\n\nShortly after the first part of season 3 premiered on Netflix, Twitter and Reddit were full of speculation that this could happen. \"did they make francesca gay on bridgerton??? or am i just reading into things? pls tell me if you got the same vibes,\" tweeted one viewer. \"Francesca Bridgerton is gay u heard it here folks,\" wrote another, to which someone else replied: \"Literally first episode of the season and i clocked it.\"\n\nIn the books, John and Francesca are very close to Michael. But as all things go drama-wise in the Bridgerton universe, Michael secretly has feelings for Francesca, but decides to let his feelings go for the sake of his cousin. When John dies from an implied brain aneurysm, Michael inherits John's earldom and feels overwhelmingly guilty. Francesca shares her grief with him, and finds out she's pregnant with John's child after many attempts. She ends up having a miscarriage and Michael feels really bad for wishing to have his cousin's life.\n\nMichael runs away to India for two years while Francesca holds down the fort of the estate. He eventually moves back into the estate and Francesca is totally well off on her own, but she wants to have children and is seeking to remarry. All of a sudden, there's some romantic tension between Michael and Francesca, and with internal conflict of loving her dead husband's cousin, who she had a platonic relationship with.\n\nColin finds out that Michael is still in love with Francesca, and he pep-talks him into becoming one of her suitors. He proposes, and they marry. A bunch of feelings arise with the same conflicts, but in the end, Francesca realizes that John would want her to be happy.

And just who is Michaela Stirling? In the Bridgerton season 3 finale, we meet the new character -- played by actor Masali Baduza -- and learn that she is Lord Kilmartin's cousin. Unless you've read Julia Quinn's books, that seems pretty insignificant. That is, until you factor in Francesca Bridgerton (now Kilmartin), whose reaction to meeting Michaela Stirling is so intense that she nearly forgets her new married name.\n\nAnd here's the kicker: In the books, Michaela Stirling doesn't exist...but Michael Stirling does. Because -- and consider this your spoiler warning -- in When He Was Wicked, Francesca ends up falling in love with and marrying Michael years after John passes away from a brain aneurysm.\n\nSo, what does this massive change mean for the series? And how will Michaela's arrival affect Francesca and John's future in Scotland? Before showrunner and executive producer Jess Brownell answers that question, let's back up and recap the beginning of the episode, titled \"Into the Light.\"\n\nFrancesca and John declare that they want a small, family wedding, after which they plan to make their primary residence become John's home in the Scottish Highlands. Lady Violet is none too pleased about her daughter's move, and understandably so. After all, her son Antony and his wife, Kate, are relocating to India for the time being, and Daphne and Simon are barely (if ever) around.\n\nBut Violet eventually comes around. On Francesca and John's wedding day, she even sweetly tells her daughter that watching her fall in love has proven that there's another way to love other than the typical butterflies and passion. And with that, please welcome the Earl and Countess of Kilmartin.\n\nHowever, before Francesca and John head off to Scotland, Eloise tells Francesca she wants to come with her. \"Mama will love the idea of me keeping an eye on you,\" she says. \"But in truth, I simply wish to live for a little while outside our tiny bubble. Have some adventures. I cannot change the world without seeing more of it.\" Eloise promises to give her sister and her new husband their space, and with that, it's settled.", "source": {"uri": "glamour.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Glamour UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@glamour.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masali_Baduza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masali Baduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intracranial_aneurysm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intracranial aneurysm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/664585fd105f1ca91d26d690/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BRIDGERTON_304_Unit_00930R%20(1).jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nBy the end of season three, Francesca has finally married John Stirling, the Earl of Kilmartin. At the end of the season, at a ball hosted by Penelope Featherington's sisters, she finally gets to meet another member of John's family -- his cousin, Michaela Stirling, played by Masali Baduza.\n\nBook readers will note this as a significant change: In Quinn's novels, Michaela is actually Michael, John's cousin and a close friend of Francesca's after their marriage. He's also Francesca's eventual love interest after John dies suddenly two years into his marriage with Francesca.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" doesn't really mince glances in the finale. Francesca is immediately visibly attracted to Michaela, tripping over her words as they meet and even briefly forgetting her own name. Even if you haven't read the books, the implication is clear -- Francesca is going to fall in love with this woman.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" has made some significant changes to Quinn's novels in the past -- most notably, it asserted Queen Charlotte's Blackness, and takes place in a version of Regency-era London where people of color can hold titles. But three seasons in, it has yet to meaningfully change any of the siblings' love stories, making a divergence of this level unprecedented.\n\nShowrunner Jess Brownell told Glamour that Francesca's story, and feeling of otherness, resonated with her as a queer woman and lent itself to this kind of change.\n\n\"I felt like there was fertile ground thematically in her book to nod toward telling a queer story,\" Brownell said.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" has previously dabbled in queer relationships, but only between men. In season one, Benedict befriends an artist named Henry Granville, who's engaged in a secret relationship with another man. Granville is married and tells Benedict that he and his wife have an understanding that allows him to pursue the relationship -- though only behind closed doors.\n\nMore prominently, in \"Queen Charlotte,\" the king and queen's footmen, Reynolds and Brimsley, are also in a secret relationship that appears to have dissolved by the time they reach adulthood.\n\n\"Because of the world they inhabited, it was still a hangable offense to be gay, and it was just not possible,\" Hugh Sachs, who plays older Brimsley, told Vulture.\n\nThe rules between men and women differed at the time: Sodomy was a capitol offense in England until 1861, per the Encyclopedia Britannica, while lesbian sex acts didn't fall under any legislation. Obviously, \"Bridgerton\" is far from historical text, but it seems unlikely that an open, romantic relationship between two women would fly even in the show's alternate history. The show won't be able to write a romance between Francesca and Michaela without actively engaging with what it means to pursue a relationship with another woman in high-society Regency London.\n\nThat doesn't preclude their happiness though, according to Brownell.\n\n\"There are also some elements of her story that allow us to make sure we can tell a pretty happy ending for Francesca and Michaela,\" Brownell told Glamour. \"It was important for me in telling a main queer story for us to be able to give them a happily ever after, as we have with every other couple.\"\n\nIn \"When He Was Wicked,\" Michael is forced to reluctantly assume John's title as Earl after Francesca miscarries, preventing it from passing on to one of John's sons. To make matters worse, he's also been in love with Francesca since they first met and does his best to conceal that through cultivating a rakish reputation. After John's death, he flees to India for four years, leaving Francesca to manage the Kilmartin estate.\n\n\"Bridgerton\" has gone to great pains to remind us that women cannot inherit titles, especially in season three. Inquiries from the Crown leave the Featheringtons scrambling to produce a male heir (congrats to Penelope on winning that race), and the Mondrich family inherits the Kent estate after their young son miraculously turns out to be Lady Kent's closest male relative.\n\nMichaela won't be able to inherit John's Earldom, nor presumably be able to sequester herself in India for years at a time, after his death. And as a presumably unmarried woman herself, she'll likely be facing pressure to marry, or living life as a spinster.\n\nThat doesn't mean that \"Bridgerton\" can't make adjustments to clear a thoughtful path for Francesca and Michaela. In the books, Francesca decides to pursue a second marriage after John's death not out of a need for companionship, but rather because of her desire for children. In fact, she's rather secure in her position as a widow, afforded the rare freedom to live an independent life as a woman. Should she not miscarry and give birth to John's son in the show, she would retain that freedom without question of which man would assume the title.\n\nBrownell told Glamour that despite the change from Michael to Michaela, she still plans to \"honor\" the book on television.\n\n\"Obviously, some changes will have to be made to the storyline, but there are ways to honor a lot of the book,\" Brownell said.\n\nAt this point, we can't be certain of how \"Bridgerton\" will manage Michaela's gender swap, and her eventual romance. But for this gentle writer, it's heartening to see \"Bridgerton\" take a big swing like this -- and set up a sweeping queer love story for one of its main characters.", "source": {"uri":

Francesca's suggested attraction to newcomer Michaela suggests a potential LGBTQ storyline, reflecting the show's inclusivity message. Bridgerton season 4 may diverge further from the books, with the possibility of love triangle drama for Francesca.\n\nThe future of Bridgerton has never looked so different. Bridgerton season 3's ending sets up not only a radical change to the very nature of the show in its big Lady Whistledown twist, but it also teases a change to one of the books' central relationships with potentially major ramifications.\n\nSo far, each of the Bridgerton children who were the central focus of previous seasons - first Daphne and then Anthony - have had very definite endings. That much is clear from Daphne's exit from Bridgerton entirely and how much season 3 has sidelined Anthony. And it makes sense, once they get their happy endings, the story left to tell for them becomes less important, and they're competing for screentime with the newly elevated characters.\n\nIn that respect, Francesca's Bridgerton story is different. She's the first Bridgerton to be married outside of her \"own\" season, given this was Colin's, largely thanks to what happens to her in the books. And there's a major hint of what is to come - and how much of a radical departure from the books it would be - in her final moments in Bridgerton season 3's ending.\n\nRelated Bridgerton Season 4: Confirmation & Everything We Know\n\nThe Regency Era romance has kept heart fluttering for three seasons thus far, and Netflix has already renewed Bridgerton for season 4.\n\nWhy Francesca Reacts To Michaela In Bridgerton Season 3 Close\n\nIn the final moments of the ball in Bridgerton season 3's ending, Eloise and Francesca tell the latter's new husband John Stirling that Eloise will be joining them in Scotland. In another unexpected change, John then reveals that their traveling party will be completed by his cousin, newcomer Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza).\n\nShe is immediately effervescent, and markedly different from her cousin, outrageously suggesting that \"every sordid detail John has spoken about [her] is a lie... the truth is far worse\". An incredible way to announce yourself to unfamiliar company, and an immediate suggestion that Francesca is more at the Benedict end of the scale of Bridgerton fun than Francesca's.\n\nFrancesca appears taken aback, and is unable to speak when Michaela greets her. But it's not outrage that we see in her. Her wide-eyed reaction, and stuttering loss of words (handily reflected in Lady Whistledown's voice-over) is more a hint of affection. Captivation even. This is a show based on romantic tropes and clich\u00e9s (in the best way, I might add), and this was a major hint that Francesca can't hide her attraction to Michaela.\n\nFrancesca's New Romance Tease Is Bridgerton's Biggest Ever Change\n\nWarning: SPOILERS for Bridgerton's books from this point onAs fans of the Bridgerton books will be aware, Francesca's marriage to John Stirling is tragically short, as the Earl of Kilmartin dies after a brain aneurism just two years later. In \"When He Was Wicked\", Francesca then goes on to marry John's cousin and heir, whose name is a big hint for the radical change I've already talked about: Michael Stirling.\n\nIt seems that Bridgerton is setting up Michaela as Michael's direct replacement, which fundamentally changes Francesca's story after John's death. There is, of course, the possibility that Bridgerton season 4 will not show John's death, and will instead embroil Francesca in a love triangle, but either way, this will be a major change.\n\nIn the books, Francesca and Michael share a kiss, which prompts Francesca to feel ashamed and flee to Scotland. It's not hard to see a path to Bridgerton changing that story, but keeping the element of shame for Francesca as she wrestles with her feelings. But even if John dies, and Francesca and Michaela get together later, it would mean that Francesca's children from the books - John and Janet may end up not existing.\n\nBridgerton has changed storylines quite a lot, including Penelope's decision to continue her gossip column, and Benedict's bisexual tryst with Paul and Lady Tilley, so this wouldn't be unprecedented. The idea of Francesca already potentially harboring feelings of attraction for John's cousin before his death does somewhat diminish the tragedy of his potential death, but added drama is never a bad thing.\n\nBridgerton Author Julia Quinn Has Spoken About Making 1 Of The Characters LGBTQ\n\nIn an interview with Cosmopolitan, Bridgerton writer Julia Quinn was questioned on the idea of Netflix making one of the Bridgerton children LGBTQ and she responded positively.\n\n\"I love it. There is a gay character, Henry Granville, but secondary. It would be great if there was a protagonist. One of the things the series has done amazingly well is to perfectly mimic the kind of emotions you feel when you read a romance novel, which is why people read those novels. They make you feel good and the main reason is because they show a world in which anyone has the right to be happy. Being more inclusive, casting without racial prejudice, all of that contributes to that feeling. I am grateful to the Shondaland team for showing me what I could do with my books. The team of the series is huge, but I am a single person. Imagining a gay protagonist in 'The Bridgertons' seems like a good idea to me because the goal of the saga has always been to show that all people deserve a happy ending.\"\n\nWhile Benedict's sexuality obviously aligns with that, having Francesca be LGBTQ would take it further, and the core idea that \"anyone has the right to be happy\" is a particularly wholesome one to crown Bridgerton's activist spirit.\n\nBridgerton Where to Watch\n\n*Availability in US\n\nstreamrentbuy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nFrom Shondaland and creator Chris Van Dusen, Netflix's Bridgerton is based on the romance novels of the same name by author Julia Quinn.

The newlyweds won't be moving to Scotland alone, however, as her sister Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie) invites herself along to escape the scrutiny of the ton, and John reveals that his vivacious cousin, Michaela Sterling (Masali Baduza) plans on living with them at the castle as well. At the final ball of the season, John introduces Michaela to Francesca -- and it's clear that the two women have an instant connection.\n\nRead more: Even Bridgerton Is Flirting With Polyamory\n\nAs the gentle readers of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton books know well, in When He Was Wicked, the book centered around Francesca, the story begins with Francesca and John happily enjoying married life in Scotland, where they reside with John's lively cousin, Michael Stirling, who harbors a secret crush on Francesca. After John passes away from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm just two years into their marriage, Francesca is left reeling with grief, while Michael, equally grief stricken, becomes the new Earl of Kilmartin. As years pass, the pair fall in love with one another, eventually marrying and starting a family together.\n\nWhich is why the show's decision to reimagine the character of John's cousin as Michaela, instead of Michael, is significant. Though there was a queer love story for supporting characters in Queen Charlotte, and Benedict affirms his bisexuality in the last two episodes of Season 3, Bridgerton has yet to have a major queer love story or storyline. Given the source material and the palpable chemistry between Francesca and Michaela upon meeting, it's safe to assume that the two characters could have a romance in the future, which might finally give fans one of the queer romantic storylines that showrunner Jess Brownell teased earlier this year.\n\nRead more: A Brief Synopsis of All Eight Bridgerton Books\n\n\"It only feels right to show the all the ways in which people love, including queer love,\" Brownell said in an interview with Refinery 29 Australia. \"So we are exploring queer love stories across the next couple of seasons. I don't want to say exactly how that plays out, but it was important to me to foreground queer love and to tell queer stories and tell stories about queer joy as well.\"\n\nWhile it's still unknown which Bridgerton character will be the focus of the next season, here's hoping we'll get to see Francesca and Michaela's relationship develop during season 4.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cady_lang@time.com", "name": "Cady Lang", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Jessie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Jessie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Highlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Highlands"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Polyamory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refinery29", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refinery29"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BRIDGERTON_303_Unit_04920R.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Does this big 'Bridgerton' twist signal queer romance to come?", "body": "Spoiler alert! The following contains details from the Season 3 finale of \"Bridgerton.\"\n\nAll's well that ends well in 19th-century English high society in Netflix's \"Bridgerton,\" which is now streaming Part 2 of its third season. While the first four episodes centered on Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton's (Luke Newton) journey from friends to lovers, the latter half is all about Penelope's secret double life as gossip writer Lady Whistledown. By the end of the season, Whistledown's identity as Penelope is public knowledge, her marriage to Colin is strong and all is well in the Ton.\n\nBut what the heck is going on with Francesca?\n\nThird Bridgerton daughter Francesca (Hannah Dodd) also had a love story this season, finding her mild-mannered match in Lord John Kilmartin (Victor Alli). After an understated courtship, Francesca and John wed in the season finale and ready their plans to start married life in Scotland, at John's estate. They'll be traveling with Francesca's sister Eloise (Claudia Jessie) and John's cousin Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza), who is introduced to a dazed Francesca in one of the season's final scenes.\n\nWas that meeting between them awkward because of Francesca's introverted nature? Or was there something more to Francesca's reaction to her new in-law? Given that Francesca seemed a little underwhelmed by her wedding kiss with John at the altar, fans are wondering if Francesca's sexuality might be as fluid as her brother Benedict's (Luke Thompson, more on him below).\n\nWell - spoiler alert for the \"Bridgerton\" books - those wondering fans would be right. In the novel centered on Francesca, \"When He Was Wicked,\" there is no Michaela Stirling, but there is a Michael Stirling. After two years of a happy marriage, John dies suddenly of a brain aneurysm, leaving Francesca a young widow. After a long period of mourning, she is able to open herself up to love again, to John's cousin Michael Stirling. It appears that onscreen, that will happen with Michaela.\n\nIf the introduction of Michaela wasn't enough to confirm that Francesca's future romance will be queer, \"Bridgerton\" executive producer Jess Browning has confirmed it in interviews after the final four episodes of the season started streaming.\n\n\"Queer audiences haven't gotten the chance to see themselves represented in a major way on the show, which is a show that is in so many other ways so inclusive,\" Browning told Glamour. \"I felt like there was fertile ground thematically in (Francesca's) book to nod toward telling a queer story. There are also some elements of her story that allow us to make sure we can tell a pretty happy ending for Francesca and Michaela. I was important for me in telling a main queer story for us to be able to give them a happily ever after, as we have with every other couple.\"\n\nBrowning wouldn't say if that story is coming in Season 4 or later, as neither she nor Netflix has officially named a lead for the forthcoming season. But there are certainly a few candidates, as Francesca isn't the only sibling with big moments in the finale...\n\nPerhaps in a move designed to please fans who have theorized (and even hoped) that Benedict was gay, the second Bridgerton brother explores his sexuality amid his steamy relationship with the widow Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New). The couple invite a third participant into their bedchamber, Tilley's friend and sometime lover Paul Suarez (Lucas Aurelio).\n\nBut even as he explores a new side of himself, Benedict still can't stay still long enough to commit to a relationship with a woman or a man. Tilley wants something more, so he pulls away. Will he be ready for a commitment in Season 4, perhaps?\n\nOur third potential lead for Season 4 is Eloise, who tried fitting into the world of the Ton this year with a doomed friendship with poor Cressida Cowper (Jessica Madsen), but found she couldn't stomach it after all. She ends Season 3 with a determination to see more of the world in order to change it. Her first stop will be Scotland with Francesca, John and Michaela. Not sure how worldly she can get by simply moving from her rich parents' house to her rich sister's house, but we shall see.\n\nBut at least the trash-talking, optimistic and individualist Eloise is back, after she was subdued by her rift with Penelope this year.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Jessie", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Jessie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Coughlan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Coughlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upper class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courtship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alter ego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Thompson_(actor)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Thompson (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aneurysm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Madsen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Madsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_New", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hannah New"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individualism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individualism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ytW_WnftC9hSuEgNnp6t0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_entertainment_893/3223bc0a59bdb074d8e363a69ff2d4e7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Yes, that's Michaela, with an \"A.\" In the novels, John's cousin Michael is Francesca's eventual love interest, whom she marries after John's sudden death. But it seems the show is giving that romance a queer twist.\n\nMichaela, who is portrayed by South African actor Masali Baduza, only appeared for a brief moment in Season 3, but that was more than enough to signal to viewers that the series would be making its biggest change to a core love story from the books yet.\n\nIt's unclear how closely Francesca and Michaela's romance will mirror Francesca and Michael's from the Bridgerton novels. In the books, Michael pined for Francesca privately while she was married to his cousin John. Upon John's death, Michael was consumed with so much guilt over his feelings for Francesca that he distanced himself from her, but they eventually came back together and fell in love.\n\nA core element of their relationship revolved around infertility issues, as Michael longed to have children but he and Francesca failed to conceive any offspring for years.\n\nThe shift from Michael to Michaela came at the same time that Francesca's older brother Benedict started to explore his bisexuality towards the end of Season 3. Fans of the series had been calling for more inclusion in terms of sexuality ever since it began, and the new showrunner Jess Brownell seems to be making that a priority. Ahead of the third season, she promised the series would be \"exploring queer love stories across the next couple of seasons.\"", "source": {"uri": "elitedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Elite Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_kickham@elitedaily.com", "name": "Dylan Kickham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masali_Baduza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masali Baduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infertility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infertility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Genres", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/13/87369907/bridgerton_303_unit_04920r.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.3992&fp-y=0.2482", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Every sordid detail John has spoken about me is a lie,\" Michaela says playfully. \"The truth is far worse.\"\n\nFrancesca is seemingly transfixed by the bold greeting, tripping over her words as she introduces herself.\n\nIt might not seem particularly significant, but if you've read Francesca's Bridgerton book, When He Was Wicked, you know it's a game-changer.\n\nThere's no Michaela in Francesca's book, but there is a Michael -- and so far, their profiles are very similar. Michael Stirling is John's cousin, and the two are extremely close. Michael becomes best friends with Francesca, even though he's harbored a crush on her since she joined the family. Awkward!\n\nSadly, John dies in his sleep two years into his marriage with Francesca. The widow experiences a pregnancy loss soon after, and four years later, she begins thinking about getting married again because she wants to have a baby. Ultimately, she begins a passionate relationship with Michael, and the two marry. Although Francesca isn't sure she'll be able to carry a pregnancy to term, she and Michael eventually welcome two children, John and Janet.\n\nIt's unclear how the specific beats of this story will play out on TV, but showrunner Jess Brownell recently gave a hint. \"Francesca's book, for those who are familiar, it takes place over a longer amount of years and it has more twists and turns,\" she told Decider. \"We wanted to start that story earlier so that we could play out more chapters of her book.\"\n\nIf you spend a lot of time on the Bridgerton side of Reddit, you might recognize Masali Baduza's name. More than a year ago, a viewer noted through some social media sleuthing that the young actor followed (and was followed back by) several key Bridgerton players.\n\nThe user suggested Baduza might be playing Sophie Beckett (Benedict's love interest from the books). Someone else added a \"chaos theory,\" in which that the actor would be be playing a female version of Michael Stirling's character -- props to their foresight!\n\nLater, a rumored casting call for a \"quick-witted\" and \"devilish charmer\" stirred up more speculation from the Bridgerton fandom. Several people thought this was for Sophie's character, but one fan pointed out, \"[i]f the casting call wasn't for a woman, I would think this fits Michael perfectly.\" While the veracity of the casting call can't be confirmed, it's certainly interesting to revisit now that Michaela Stirling is canon.", "source": {"uri": "bustle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bustle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miscarriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregnancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pregnancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casting_(performing_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casting (performing arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Beckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/6/11/92e65dbb/bridgerton_306_unit_01860rjpgbridgerton_306_unit_01860r1.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

John's death occurs only two years into his marriage with Francesca. The young widow turns to Michael for comfort, as the two had already formed a close friendship prior to John's passing. But unbeknownst to her, Michael has been secretly pining for her since they first met.\n\nWith Michaela's introduction to the Bridgerton cinematic universe, it's probably safe to assume that Francesca's season will explore her identity as a queer woman in Regency-era England.\n\nIndeed, we already saw hints at the future couple's romance during their first introduction to each other, during which Francesca literally forgot her own name -- a callback to an earlier conversation she had with her mother, who described the shock of love at first sight: \"When I first met your father, I could barely speak my own name. I was so taken by him. I stumbled over words most familiar.\"\n\n\"When I first read When He Was Wicked in the lead up to season 1, I really related to it as a queer woman,\" Bridgerton showrunner Jess Brownell told Entertainment Weekly. \"There's some themes in that book about Francesca feeling different. Julia Quinn just means it in terms of her being an introvert. But for a lot of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different from a young age is a part of our stories. So, I felt like there was good thematic resonance telling a queer story with Francesca.\"\n\nShe added, \"And I didn't want to just insert a queer character to check a box. I really wanted to tell a story about a portion of the queer experience. There's also a certain piece of Francesca's story historically that allows us to ensure a happily ever after for her and Michaela. It was really important for me in crafting a main queer story for us to give that couple a happy ending just like every other couple.\"\n\nWhile we don't yet know which character season four will revolve around, Brownell teases that we will definitely be getting more of Michaela. \"I can't say in what capacity, just in terms of not tipping my hand of where we're going. But there is going to be a relationship between Michaela and Fran, as per the books,\" she said.\n\nAnd if you're preemptively mourning the loss of chemistry between Hannah Dodd and Victor Alli, who play Francesca and John, respectively, then have no fear -- there's more in store for that relationship, too. \"I also want to say that we're still honoring what John and Francesca have as well,\" Brownell said. \"I know a lot of people have really connected with that relationship. And something I love about Francesca's book is it's actually a story of two great loves. So we do intend to honor that.\"", "source": {"uri": "harpersbazaar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Harper's BAZAAR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bachelor's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandalorian_(season_1)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Mandalorian (season 1)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_at_first_sight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Love at first sight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regency era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shared universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemistry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Writing and Literature", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vs-netflix-bridgertone8intothelight-62-10-666b41fdda758.jpg?crop=0.995xw:1.00xh;0.00326xw,0&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Yet, when he does speak, particularly with Francesca Bridgerton, their love transcends silence. British actor Victor Alli, a newcomer to the ton, steps into the beloved role as highlighted in the sixth book of Julia Quinn's book series, \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\nBefore the premiere of part two on Netflix, I chatted with Alli about what happens between Francesca and John in the final four episodes, what's next for the humble couple, and navigating his heartbreaking fate as revealed in \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\nThe ton is introduced to John Stirling, The Earl of Kilmartin, in Season 3, Episode 3, \"Forces of Nature.\" For Alli, seeing viewers' reactions to John was what he \"loved and enjoyed\" most about bringing his character on screen. Although Francesca (Hannah Dodd) is being courted by Lord Samadani, a friend of Her Majesty, she unexpectedly encounters John at the Innovations ball.\n\nFrancesca and John find themselves outside, seeking a moment of peace from the hustle and bustle of the party. Their shared silence becomes a moment of connection between them, and in Episode 4, John surprises Francesca with a piece of sheet music rearranged to her specific liking.\n\n\"He [John] was quite different, to say, Mr. Samadani and some other characters we saw earlier in part one,\" the British actor says. \"He is very sure of himself. Despite his shyness, he's quite confident and doesn't feel he needs to prove anything or try to change.\"\n\nIn part two, John continues to court Francesca and spends more time at Bridgerton House with her family. After getting to know each other, the couple announces their engagement. The Bridgertons react excitedly, but Lady Bridgerton has reservations about their unconventional path to marriage, which differs from her other children's passionate romances.\n\nFrancesca and John ask Violet to speak with the Queen to obtain permission for them to marry. However, Lady Bridgerton, still unsure about their match, avoids speaking with Her Majesty. Francesca grows frustrated with her mother. \"I think as mother, of course, she's going to be quite protective. So protective that I thought she didn't like me,\" Alli explains.\n\nUltimately, Francesca is the one to tell Queen Charlotte about her and John's secret engagement. (This happens after Her Majesty suspects that one of the Bridgerton siblings is Lady Whistledown.) Violet and Francesca's relationship improves after the mother and daughter have a heart-to-heart conversation toward the end of Season 3, in which Francesca expresses her love for the Earl.\n\n\"There was a moment of conversation between her [Violet] and Francesca before the wedding,\" Alli credits as the turning point in her mother's acceptance. \"I think when Violet saw they were being serious and really wanted to be with each other, she backed off and said, 'Okay, who am I to stop my daughter from finding love.'\"\n\nOne of the couple's most memorable scenes from Season 3 was at Colin and Penelope's wedding breakfast. Before the event, John was advised by the Bridgerton men to \"be bold\" in showcasing his affection for Francesca. So, he asks her to dance in front of her family and members of the ton.\n\n\"It was something we'd never done before and something that we wouldn't usually do. It was a big moment for us,\" Alli describes of their impromptu dance. \"I think that again, when Violet saw that, that was half of the reason she backed off.\"\n\nThe couple finally marry in an intimate ceremony surrounded by family. Francesca and John also share their plans to move to Scotland after their nuptials, and they will be joined by Francesca's sister, Eloise. Alli says he is excited for Scotland so the couple can start their new life together.\n\n\"What's exciting is John has always been someone who didn't like the drama, the sort of tension. And him moving to Scotland is a massive move, and Francesca's down for it as well,\" he adds.\n\nBut before their travels, Lord Kilmartin introduces Francesca and Eloise to his cousin, Michaela Stirling (portrayed by Masali Baduza). In Julia Quinn's book, \"When He Was Wicked,\" Michaela Stirling is not a woman, but a man named Michael Stirling whom Francesca marries after John unexpectedly dies.\n\nThis major change from the books suggests that Francesca will have a relationship with Michaela in a future season of Bridgerton, marking the first time a queer romance will at the forefront in the Netflix series. Showrunner Jess Brownell previously told Pride that she wanted to incorporate more queer storylines in the show.\n\n\"I want to see more queer joy on my screens and that was definitely a priority for me when I stepped into the showrunner role,\" Brownell explained. \"How exactly that plays out over this season and the next couple seasons, I can't say specifically, but I will say I'm excited for fans to see that.\"\n\nMichaela's introduction \"will take a lot of people by surprise,\" Alli tells us. He recalled the moment he found out about Masali Baduza's casting on a Zoom call with Brownell.\n\n\"I remember Jess Brownell on a Zoom call and she was telling me and I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!'\" Alli added that the showrunner and the Bridgerton team have made \"some really strong decisions\" from season one until now, and he's excited for Michaela to come \"into this world.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I had an amazing welcome into the ton and the cast, and absolutely she will get that as well. I'm really excited for her to come on board and show everyone how incredible she is.\"\n\nLooking ahead, Alli says Francesca and John's next steps are to move to Scotland and hopefully start a family. The British star admitted that he hasn't \"prepared himself\" for his character's unfortunate fate as told in \"When He Was Wicked,\" but he has an optimistic outlook.\n\n\"I'm just gonna take it as it comes.

Despite protests from her mother and the Queen, Francesca chose John and pushed to marry him as quickly as possible.\n\nBut the final moments of the season brought a massive twist to those who know where Francesca's story is headed based on the books. In Julia Quinn's novel, When He Was Wicked, Francesca is a widow after losing her husband, John Stirling (sob, we hardly knew ye, quiet chemistry) -- and she slowly finds herself falling for John's cousin, Michael.\n\nIt seems the Netflix series is headed in a similar direction, with one major change: Michael is now Michaela (played by Masali Baduza). And by the looks of things, Francesca is already stunned by the attraction she feels (if her face in the moment John introduces her to Michaela is any indication). That's right, Bridgerton is apparently ready for its first central queer romance -- and showrunner Jess Brownell tells Entertainment Weekly that it's a shift that came with immense thought and reverence for the original novel.\n\n\"When I first read When He Was Wicked in the lead up to season 1, I really related to it as a queer woman,\" Brownell explains. \"There's some themes in that book about Francesca feeling different. Julia Quinn just means it in terms of her being an introvert. But for a lot of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different from a young age is a part of our stories. So, I felt like there was good thematic resonance telling a queer story with Francesca.\"\n\n\"And I didn't want to just insert a queer character to check a box,\" she continues. \"I really wanted to tell a story about a portion of the queer experience. There's also a certain piece of Francesca's story historically that allows us to ensure a happily ever after for her and Michaela. It was really important for me in crafting a main queer story for us to give that couple a happy ending just like every other couple.\"\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nThough whether or not that will come as soon as season 4, Brownell won't say. \"You're going to see more of Michaela next season,\" she promises. \"I can't say in what capacity, just in terms of not tipping my hand of where we're going. But there is going to be a relationship between Michaela and Fran, as per the books.\"\n\nStill, don't mourn Alli's presence on the show too soon. \"I also want to say that we're still honoring what John and Francesca have as well,\" Brownell adds. \"I know a lot of people have really connected with that relationship. And something I love about Francesca's book is it's actually a story of two great loves. So we do intend to honor that.\"", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/Fcp3arTOudZ9N5-2t9VWjPCfpdQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(972x470:974x472)/Victor-Alli-as-John-Stirling-Hannah-Dodd-as-Francesca-Bridgerton-061224-c800bd15a1794c2fbbb972f0d295eea6.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

What happens in the show and book", "body": "Warning: This story contains spoilers for \"Bridgerton\" Season Three and Julia Quinn's book, \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\n\"Bridgerton\" Season Three features two new love stories.\n\nThis time around we see Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) fall in love with Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan).\n\nMeanwhile, another Bridgerton sibling makes a match, as Francesca (Hannah Dodd) marries John Stirling (Victor Alli) in Part Two of Season Three, which dropped on Netflix June 13.\n\nThe season opens with Francesca, who was played by Ruby Stokes in the first two seasons, making her debut to Queen Charlotte (Golda Rosheuvel). While the queen initially fails to name a diamond of the season, Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh) influences her to see the shy Francesca in a new light.\n\n\"She just doesn't want to be the center of attention,\" Dodd tells TODAY.com.\n\nAs a result, Francesca's approach to finding love is \"logical.\"\n\n\"She's not excited about it. She's kind of in between Daphne and Eloise in the sense that she's not fighting the system, and she's not against getting married,\" Dodd says. \"It's not something that she's dreamed about her whole life. She knows that it's her time. She knows that she's going to have to go through these motions and do it.\"\n\nFrancesca is named the queen's \"sparkler,\" but trouble emerges as Queen Charlotte's match for Francesca -- Lord Samadani -- conflicts with her fondness for the Earl of Kilmartin, a quiet, reserved gentleman.\n\nIt also sparks concern from Francesca's mother, Violet, who wants her daughter to find a love match.\n\n\"(Francesca's) not doing anything wrong. She's not being a problem in any way. But Violet obviously wants her to have the love that she deserves,\" Dodd says.\n\nAlli tells TODAY.com that John and Francesca's relationship comes from compatibility.\n\n\"We're so similar in a way, and I quite like that,\" he says. \"We share such an interesting bond where we don't have to say too much but we can still connect.\"\n\nIn the show, the two share many moments of silence, simply sitting and listening to the world around them. Francesca, who loves playing music and reading, develops a sense of companionship with John.\n\n\"That's not the conventional way of getting to know someone, but somehow we managed to sort of explore that and it sort of goes further,\" Alli says. \"The relationship blossoms and we get to understand each other through the silences, and then yes, of course, we do speak as well, but it's quite nice to sort of have these moments of silence and have inner monologues.\"\n\nAt the end of part one, John gives Francesca a piece of sheet music, owning up to the fact that he's \"not a man of many words.\"\n\n\"But I do believe in the power of a gesture,\" he says.\n\nAfter, Francesca is giddy as she plays her piano forte.\n\n\"Lord Kilmartin, he had the music we heard earlier this week rearranged exactly as I imagined it,\" she tells her mother, blushing.\n\nThe two get engaged in part two and marry in Episode Eight. When they share their first kiss at the wedding ceremony, Francesca looks disappointed for a brief moment.\n\nBut she looks awestruck when she meets John's cousin in the finale, Michaela Stirling. She is set to travel with them to Scotland, home of the Kilmartin estate. Francesca fumbles through an awkward introduction, having been left speechless by Michaela.\n\nWhat happens in the 'Bridgerton' book about Francesca?\n\nWhile viewers are getting a taste of Francesca's love story in Season Three, the third Bridgerton daughter doesn't take center stage until book six in Julia Quinn's series.\n\nDodd says the first thing she did when she was cast in Season Three of \"Bridgerton\" was read \"When He Was Wicked.\"\n\n\"It definitely went into my character development with Francesca because she's not really present in the other books. That was all I really had to work off,\" Dodd says.\n\n\"When He Was Wicked\" opens with Francesca and John in love and married, living in Scotland as the Earl and Countess of Kilmartin. The couple also maintains a close friendship with John's cousin, Michael Stirling, a character who is seemingly adapted for the show as Michaela, setting the stage for Francesca to have one of the show's first queer romances.\n\nThe book is told from Michael and Francesca's perspectives. Readers quickly learn that Michael fell in love with Francesca at first sight -- only they met just hours before her wedding to John.\n\nTwo years later, John dies suddenly of a ruptured cerebral aneurysm, leaving Francesca a widow and making Michael the new earl. But instead of stepping up to the task, he flees to India in his grief and doesn't return to Francesca's side for four years.\n\nWhen he returns, Francesca has decided she wants a child and is seeking to remarry, while Michael realizes he has not moved on from his unrequited crush. Their friendship gives way to sizzling chemistry, and they eventually fall in love.\n\nDodd says Francesca's arc in Season Three does contain some foreshadowing to the events of \"When He Was Wicked,\" specifically through Francesca's relationship with her mother, Violet, as they are both widows in the book.\n\n\"I've tried to kind of create that relationship with Violet just because there's so many similarities going forward,\" Dodd says. \"Everything that I kind of did to create Francesca comes from that book.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Francesca Changes, Explained", "body": "Here Are 'Bridgerton' Season 3's Biggest Differences from the Book\n\nSeason 3 of Shondaland's and Netflix's Bridgerton is now complete, with Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin (Luke Newton) happily married, though not without some trials. With Part 2 of Season 3 now streaming on Netflix, the friends-to-lovers arc has been seen through to an elaborate wedding and a revelation that Penelope is, in fact, the prolific gossip column writer Lady Whistledown.\n\nFrancesca's (Hannah Dodd) love story -- or at least part of it -- also unfolded alongside that of #Polin, but the introduction of a certain character in Season 3's finale hints at big things to come for the recast character, who was portrayed by Ruby Stokes in Seasons 1 and 2.\n\nYes, dear reader, Michaela Stirling's introduction marks a big deal. Who is Michaela Stirling, you ask? Read on for an explanation of the major character reveal, and why the change to her gender makes way for a big plot twist.\n\nWho is Michaela Stirling?\n\nMichaela Stirling (portrayed by Masali Baduza), enters the Bridgertonverse in the final moments of the Season 3 finale at the Featherington sisters' ball. John Stirling (Victor Alli), who has just married Hannah Dodd's Francesca in a small, intimate ceremony held in the Bridgerton drawing room, introduces his wife to Michaela, his cousin.\n\nNot exactly. In Francesca's book, When He Was Wicked, by Julia Quinn, John's cousin is a man named Michael. Michael is introduced very early on in the novel, and his inner monologue reveals that he covets Francesca, who is already married to John. The literary John tragically dies of an aneurysm in the books, and Michael, who inherits his title as the Earl of Kilmartin, assumes all of his responsibilities. Francesca, who remains the Countess of Kilmartin, attempts to search for a new husband, but once Michael makes romantic advances, which she welcomes, they realize their feelings for each other and marry.\n\nCould Michaela Stirling become a love interest for Francesca Bridgerton?\n\nSeason 3 showrunner Jess Brownell told Deadline that she has \"been pitching the Francesca queer story from the beginning.\"\n\nThe look on Francesca's (Hannah Dodd's) face when Michaela is introduced leaves plenty of room for an exploration of a romance between the two women.\n\n\"When I read her book, I, as a queer woman, really related to her book. Maybe in a way Julia Quinn didn't intend, but a lot of Francesca's book is about feeling different from her family and from the world around her and not really knowing why,\" she said. \"In the book, I think it's mostly just about being introverted. But I think for a lot of queer people, not every queer person, but a lot of queer people, that sense of feeling different from the time you're young, is part of our stories. So it felt like a natural one to gender bend.\"\n\nBrownell doesn't want the thread to turn into a \"queer tragedy.\"\n\nThe Regency era didn't allow women to inherit titles, as Michaela would have to do if Alli's Stirling does die later on, but Brownell teased a \"queer happily ever after\" versus a \"queer trauma.\"\n\nThese questions and many more can only be answered in Season 4 of the Netflix period series, which is in the works.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dessi_gomez@deadline.com", "name": "Dessi Gomez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Stokes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruby Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shondaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shondaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Coughlan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Coughlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regency_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regency era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tragedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychological trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "label": "dmoz/Computers/E-Books", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Reading Groups", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/BRIDGERTON_303_Unit_04920R.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Not that I'm speaking for experience or anything.\n\nSpoilers ahead for the entirety of Bridgerton season 3, as well as for the contents of both When He Was Wicked and To Sir Phillip, With Love.\n\nWhile the story of our two leads wrapped up beautifully -- both when it came to their personal struggles and to that tiny detail that was Penelope's secret identity as Lady Whistledown -- I think it's safe to say that one of the most shocking moments of the season finale was when Lord Kilmartin, Francesca's new husband, introduced his cousin. And that cousin was revealed not to be Michael Stirling, as those familiar with the Bridgerton books expected, but Michaela Stirling.\n\nFirst a bit of background. At the Dankworth-Finch ball, Eloise asks Francesca if she can accompany her and John back to his estate in Scotland. Eloise has finally decided to see more of the world and step outside the usual, comfortable bubble of the London ton. Francesca is delighted to have her older sister joining, and so is John -- who says that their party will actually consist of four people before introducing his cousin Michaela to his new wife and sister-in-law. To say that I was up on my couch screaming when he said her name would be a massive understatement.\n\nPlayed by South African actress Masali Baduza, Michaela Stirling's addiction to the show opens so many possible avenues -- most of them queer, let's be honest -- that I'm kind of feeling dizzy thinking about them all.\n\nFrancesca's novel -- When He Was Wicked, one of the best of the entire series -- focuses entirely on her grief over John's untimely passing and her growing feelings for his cousin Michael, who has inherited the title of Earl Kilmartin and who ends up being her second husband.\n\nSo one of the possible directions in which the story could go is that John's fate remains the same and that Francesca discovers her own queerness, much like Benedict did. She did seem particularly struck by Michaela, after all, what with all the slow motion and the eye close-ups happening during their introduction.\n\nIf that were the case, I don't think Michaela would inherit the title over Francesca since they're both women -- even though laws and customs do work in their own special Bridgerton way. Maybe Francesca could keep the title in her own right as John's widow, or be a sort of regent to a hypothetical son.\n\nThen again, all of this has one requirement -- John's passing, which I'm not particularly keen on, especially now that we've met him and had the chance to know him. So if John were to remain alive, would Michaela's introduction maybe have something to do with Eloise?\n\nEloise is, after all, the other Bridgerton sibling alongside Benedict who has had some signs of queercoded-ness here and there -- and her friendship with Cressida has been clocked by several fans as potentially romantic in its undertones. Besides, her own canon romance also hinges on the death of a character we've already come to know -- Marina Thompson, who married Sir Phillip Crane at the end of season one. Marina's book ending is pretty devastating and I would love for the show to go down any other path but that, to be honest.\n\nThis trip to Scotland seems like the perfect opportunity to have some feelings grow. John and Francesca will be in their introverted newlywed bubble, leaving Eloise and Michaela plenty of time to get to know each other and hopefully to feel some sparks. I think it's safe to say this is my favorite option!\n\nThere's also a third one, I suppose, even though it seems the least likely of the three -- that Michaela somehow takes on the role of Sophie Beckett and becomes Benedict's love interest next season, which is very likely to be dedicated to the second eldest Bridgerton brother.\n\nWhile we never know what Shondaland has in store until we actually see it play out, I think that merging two characters into Michaela might be a bit too much. I would still bet on one of the two previous options to happen in the future.\n\nPlus, it's Pride Month -- and I'm always one for as many queer romances as possible.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedetta_geddo@themarysue.com", "name": "Benedetta Geddo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westworld_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westworld (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secret identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_finale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Season finale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masali_Baduza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masali Baduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slow motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Close-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shondaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shondaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Beckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bridgerton-Season-Three-John-Stirling-Francesca-Bridgerton.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

After Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and John got married, they made plans to move to his home in Scotland. They were joined on their travels by Francesca's sister Eloise (Claudia Jessie) and John's cousin, whose gender was swapped from the original character named Michael.\n\n\"Dearest Gentle Reader, I find myself suddenly at a loss for words,\" Lady Whistledown (Julie Andrews) said in a voiceover as Francesca appeared visibly tongue-tied the minute she met Michaela. This interaction quickly intrigued fans who questioned whether it was a setup for a potential romance down the line.\n\nFans have been eagerly searching for clues about which Bridgerton sibling is at the center of season 4. Based on a book series by Julia Quinn, Bridgerton has a different main character in each book as it follows the members of the wealthy Bridgerton family in their respective searches for love in 19th century London.\n\nSeason 3 was Benedict's (Luke Newton) time to shine as he realized his feelings for family friend Penelope (Nicola Coughlan), which took inspiration from Quinn's novel Romancing Mr. Bridgerton. The season was different in that it was the first time the show didn't follow book order since Benedict -- and his love interest Sophie -- were the focus of the third novel, An Offer From a Gentleman.\n\nThompson, however, wasn't bothered by the fact that Benedict's story was delayed.\n\n\"It'd be nice to give the character a full exploration, that'd be really fun, but the way the show runs -- it's a big ensemble show,\" he told Country and Town House in May. \"As long as I'm given interesting things to do, I don't really mind.\"\n\nEven though Benedict was presumed to be next in line, season 3 also introduced Francesca as a potential contender. Francesca's debut into society meant she met John (Victor Alli) and book fans were well aware that he would be her first husband. After (spoiler alert!) John's shocking death, Francesca found love again with John's cousin, according to Quinn's novel When He Was Wicked. Going by how quickly Francesca and John found themselves married in season 3 -- and how soon Michaela was introduced to the audience -- it seems even more likely that Francesca is next.\n\n\"I am really not trying to shake things up too much. I really believe in the vision of the show,\" Brownell told Refinery29 in April. \"I really want to serve the stories and the books the best way possible. It just naturally felt like, for Penelope and Colin, it made sense to lean into a romantic comedy tropes. So this season does have a bit more humor in it and it has the awkward banter. So that's something that will feel slightly elevated in terms of being different from last season.\"\n\nBrownell said season 3 would hint at who the next lead would be, telling TV Insider that same month, \"I won't give you anything, but I do think that there are some clues at the end of Season 3 of where we're headed.

Proceed accordingly.\n\nColin and Penelope weren't the only love match in Bridgerton's third season.\n\nFrancesca (played by Hannah Dodd) found a fitting partner in the reserved but dashing John Sterling, Earl of Kilmartin (Victor Alli). After a season-long courtship, the pair wed with an intimate ceremony at the Bridgerton home in Thursday's finale. They planned to live on John's remote Scotland estate, which offered the peace and quiet they craved. Eloise asked to accompany them in the hopes of gaining new life experiences to one day change the world.\n\nHowever, John invited another to join them: his cousin Michaela (Masali Baduza), whose name should sound familiar to book fans. In When He Was Wicked, Francesca -- spoiler alert -- fell for John's rakish cousin Michael following John's untimely death.\n\nWith that in mind, Francesca's flustered reaction when being introduced to Michaela at the Featherington Ball raised a pressing question: Was this setting up Season 4's big romance?\n\nShowrunner Jess Brownell tells TVLine, \"We're not saying one way or the other who's next, but we wanted to introduce that part of Francesca's story. Her story is one that has more installments than some of the other book stories and so, we're getting started on it a little more quickly.\"\n\nRegarding Michaela's gender swap, the EP recalls the first time she read Francesca's book.\n\n\"I really related to Francesca's story as a queer woman,\" she shares. \"Her book isn't intended to be a queer story -- at least the way Julia Quinn wrote it. But Francesca talks a lot in the book about feeling different and not quite knowing why at times. I think [author] Julia Quinn was really just talking about introversion.\n\n\"But that can sometimes be a part of the queer experience, that sense of feeling different,\" Brownell adds. \"I thought there was fertile ground there to explore for Francesca in a queer story on the show.\"\n\nThe Bridgerton boss notes that John's death in the book had no impact on how the show handled his romance with Francesca. Instead, her writing team focused on creating a new kind of love interest for the Netflix drama -- someone who complimented Francesca's soft energy.\n\n\"[In the book], you only get a little bit of John before we lose him, and we really thought it was a great opportunity to see a different kind of romantic lead in Bridgerton,\" she explains. \"So often, especially our men... they're all rakes, and they're very extroverted. Francesca is still coming out of her shell, and I think it was only right to give her a match with someone who could understand her quietness.\"", "source": {"uri": "tvline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVLine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "keisha_hatchett@tvline.com", "name": "Keisha Hatchett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Courtship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_4)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 4)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVLine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TVLine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extended play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(love)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance (love)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bridgerton-Season-3-Finale-Francesca-John.jpg?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

However, the show has opted to reimagine this character as female, renaming her Michaela Stirling.\n\nMichaela, portrayed by South African actress Masali Baduza, makes her debut in the season finale, meeting Francesca and Eloise Bridgerton.

This marks a significant step towards inclusivity, introducing an LGBTQ+ romance into the series.\n\nJess Brownell, the showrunner for season three, had previously hinted at a queer storyline for the season and beyond. While initial speculation centered around Benedict Bridgerton, it now appears that Francesca's storyline will take this direction in future seasons, as according to the book Francessa's love interest in Micheal Stirling, so introducing a Michela Stirling points to that direction.\n\nMasali Baduza, known for her roles in the British drama series Noughts + Crosses, the slasher film Slumber Party Massacre, and the action-adventure film The Woman King, brings Michaela Stirling to life in this period drama.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pop_culture@tribune.com.pk", "name": "Pop Culture", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masali_Baduza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masali Baduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noughts_+_Crosses", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noughts + Crosses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slasher_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slasher film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Woman King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Action film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Programs", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/bridgerton1718301092-0/bridgerton1718301092-0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

But one that we definitely didn't see coming is the introduction of Michaela Stirling, a sort of familiar character that is definitely here to shake things up for Francesca Bridgerton, who recently got married to John Stirling and is now headed off to Scotland to live with her new husband, his cousin, and Eloise who is now joining on the adventure. If the name feels familiar, that's because she is based off another character, Michael Stirling, who plays a big part in her story. So just who is she and what is going to happen next?\n\nHere's everything you need to know about Michaela Stirling in Bridgerton.\n\nMichaela is first introduced in the last moments of season 3 as John's cousin. According to her, \"every sordid detail John has spoken about me is a lie. The truth is far worse.\" Francesca seems to have a little crush on her during their first meeting as she can't even remember her own name when talking to her. It seems that her and John are close, especially considering the fact that she traveled all the way to London to just join him on the trip back to Scotland.\n\nIn the books, Michaela is actually Michael and he has a big storyline that connects him with Francesca. Book spoilers below!\n\nJohn actually dies leaving Francesca and Michael both super heartbroken. Michael in the books also takes over the title of Lord Kilmartin after the death of his cousin. While his crush on her is actually one-sided at first, the two eventually do get together and marry after they deal with their heartbreaking loss.\n\nThere's still no word on if this will play out the same way in the TV show, but we can imagine that it'll be sort of similar especially since they're introducing her now.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Technostress", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/.F0Ec7AEpdXIm1chHHoJYg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/1c069e1a3c0415bcf9b5c84d06e56a96", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Played by Hannah Dodd, fans were immediately drawn into the new storyline, and drawn to the new star.\n\nHere's your second spoiler alert - we're about to dive into some plot points for the new season of the show, and the books! So, if you don't want to know, scroll ahead.\n\nFor the rest of you ... Bridgerton Season 3, Part 1 opens with Francesca meeting a potential love interest, John Sterling. Making her debut for the season, Francesca is looking for the same kind of love her parents once had.\n\nWith only 4 episodes dropped in Part 1, fans didn't see that much development. However, Part 2 skyrocketed the relationship. By the finale, Francesca and John Stirling are married and reveal that they are moving to John's family home in Scotland. It's a tough blow for Violet, to watch yet another of her children leave the nest, let alone move an entire country away\n\nBut she need not worry. If you've read the books, you know this is just the start of Francesca's story, leading to one of the biggest twists in the Bridgerton franchise.\n\nFrancesca's love story is the focus of author Julia Quinn's sixth Bridgerton novel, \"When He Was Wicked\".\n\nIn the book, Francesca does marry John Stirling, Earl of Kilmartin - but their love story is short lived.\n\nJohn suddenly and tragically dies, leaving Francesca a widow, just like her mother.\n\nHowever, while mourning the loss of her husband, Francesca finds comfort in John's cousin, Michael Stirling. The majority of the book explores the complexity of the pair starting their own romance after John's death. Eventually, all works out and the pair get married.\n\nIs Hannah Dodd, Who Plays Francesca, Married?\n\nHannah is a new face to the hit franchise. She's taking over the role of Francesca from Ruby Stokes, who played her in the first two seasons.\n\nYou've likely seen her before in blockbusters Eternals and Enola Holmes 2. What you haven't seen is a ring on her finger. Hannah Dodd is not married, and at present, it's bit unclear what her relationship status actually is.\n\nThere are no recent photos of Hannah on her social media with a romantic partner, and there are only rumors of who she's dated recently.\n\nThere was speculating Hannah was dating her co-star from the project Find Me in Paris, Rory Saper, after the actress began posting cutesy pictures of them on Instagram. But that hasn't happened in a long time.\n\nMore recently, insiders have suggested that English singer-songwriter Sam Fender has been sliding into her DMs.\n\n\"Sam thinks Hannah is absolutely stunning and has been liking her pictures like crazy,\" said one insider to The Sun, \"which is of course very flattering for her.\"\n\n\"She has also followed him back and they are getting on very well...It's a case of watch this space.\"\n\nGiven the boost Bridgerton is giving to Hannah in the zeitgeist, you can bet there are tons more people watching the space for sure!", "source": {"uri": "thehollywoodgossip.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Gossip"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dina_sartore_bodo@thehollywoodgossip.com", "name": "Dina Sartore-Bodo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Dodd_(actress)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Dodd (actress)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stirling"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enola_Holmes_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enola Holmes 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Stokes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruby Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternals_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eternals (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Find_Me_in_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Find Me in Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Fender", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Fender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sun_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Sun (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockbuster (entertainment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Volleyball/Players", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber_Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Cyber Relationships", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2152314791.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Like the rest of the ton, you might be wondering what's in store for the Bridgerton beauty - will she end up with her dashing new suitor or make a love match elsewhere?\n\nIf you've already scoured the pages of When He Was Wicked, then you'll know all too well who Francesca ends up with. But, if you're none the wiser and privy to a few spoilers then we've got the lowdown on her love story...\n\nBefore the sixth book, When He Was Wicked, Francesca had already married the Earl of Kilmartin in a love match. However, at the beginning of the novel, it transpires that she is now a widow, and has been for the past four years while grieving the loss of her husband.\n\nHowever, her late husband's cousin, Michael, is one of London's most infamous bachelors and has always held a torch for Francesca, despite only meeting her for the first time at his cousin's wedding.\n\nThe synopsis reads: \"After a lifetime of chasing women, of smiling slyly as they chased him, of allowing himself to be caught but never permitting his heart to become engaged, he took one look at Francesca Bridgerton and fell so fast and hard into love it was a wonder he managed to remain standing.\"\n\nMichael becomes the new Earl of Kilmartin but goes to stay in India while grieving John, who was also his best friend. Upon deciding that she is ready to remarry and that she wants a baby, and with Michael feeling the pressure to produce an heir, they decide on a pragmatic match - on Francesca's side, while Michael has been in love with her for years. While we won't give it all away, no Julia Quinn book would be complete with a happily ever after!\n\nThe big question is - will the Netflix series follow the novel? Based on the season three finale, it looks like this won't be the case. Again - spoilers ahead so stop scrolling if you haven't binged the new episodes of Bridgerton.\n\nIn the grand finale, Eloise is delighted after Francesca invites to her go to Scotland with herself and her new husband, Lord Kilmartin. But a huge twist reveals that Kilmartin's cousin Michael Stirling has been gender-swapped to Michaela, leaving us with more questions than ever.\n\nWhatever happens, it looks like Francesca's relationships will take a backseat in season four, with fans predicting that Benedict will finally get his romance in the next instalment.

In one of the final moments of the episode, John Stirling (Victor Alli) and Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd) are greeted by his cousin Michaela (Baduza) upon their recent nuptials.\n\n\"I caution you. Every sordid detail John has spoken about me is a lie,\" Michaela teased after John introduced his relative. \"The truth is far worse.\"\n\nMichaela Stirling appears to be a gender-swapped version of Michael Stirling, who is Francesca's love interest from Julia Quinn's book When He Was Wicked. Alli previously teased the arrival of John's cousin in an exclusive interview with Us Weekly last month.\n\n\"It'll be nice to sort of see that dynamic with his family and his wife,\" Alli told Us of what future seasons of Bridgerton will look like for the Stirling clan. \"It'd be really interesting to see the journey with them both in the upcoming season. The writers are incredible, so I put my faith and my trust that they'll do something incredible.\"\n\nApartheid, an institutionalized system of racial segregation, ended in the early 1990s, but several of its lingering discriminatory rules remained. (Baduza was born shortly after the system legally ended.)\n\n\"We had a rule book of things we could and couldn't do to our hair -- including one that said Black girls couldn't wear their natural afros because it was unprofessional and it looked unkempt,\" Baduza recalled to The Independent in March 2020. \"We had to style our hair into something that was more acceptable. You know, having that as your mindset as a young Black girl is just ... traumatizing. It's kind of like who you are naturally is not good enough.\"\n\nBaduza studied acting at the New York Film Academy after graduating from high school. In a March 2020 interview with the Royal Television Society, she said she would \"love to do it all\" in terms of booking certain types of jobs.\n\n\"I think moving forward I'd like to tell stories that comment on society and on injustices, but having said that I would also love to play a character in a story where race isn't a factor,\" Baduza said. \"Where it can be a Black couple who are living and the fact that they are Black doesn't have anything to do with the story.\"\n\nBaduza's Michaela only appeared in one episode of season 3, joining Francesca and her family to celebrate the debutante's wedding to John. Francesca appeared to get flustered in Michaela's presence.\n\nThere is no Michaela in the Bridgerton book universe, but there is a Michael. According to literary canon, Francesca and Michael first met on the eve of her wedding to John, and he went on to harbor a secret crush. When He Was Wicked, the sixth book in Quinn's series, follows Francesca's life as a young widow after John dies of an aneurysm.

But ultimately, this third run suffered from feeling a little cramped, with not enough room for the multiple plotlines to breathe.\n\nFor instance, it'll likely become more than meme-worthy how many tense finale moments were interspersed with Benedict's (Luke Thompson) threesome scenes with Lady Tilley Arnold (Hannah New) and Paul Suarez (Lucas Aurelio). Oh, typical Benedict, you may sigh.\n\nBut actually, the character's exploration of his sexuality this season was so welcome, it deserved quite the spotlight. While it didn't fully get it, could Bridgerton be taking an important turn away from the Julia Quinn novels?\n\nWith all eyes on Benedict or even Eloise (Claudia Jessie) as the Bridgerton sibling in line to be the next series lead, there are set to be more questions than ever about how the season 3 finale sets up season 4.\n\nBut along with the drop of the four new episodes today also comes the news that any excitement that may be brewing for the fourth season should be put on hold for at least a couple of years.\n\nShowrunner Jess Brownell confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that the fourth season won't be on our screens until 2026, explaining: \"We are working to try and put the seasons out more quickly, but they do take eight months to film and then they have to be edited, and then they have to be dubbed into every language.\n\n\"And the writing takes a very long time as well, so we're kind of on a two-year pace - we're trying to speed up, but somewhere in that range.\"\n\nOf course, TV fans can be a little impatient when it comes to their favourite series. And with there also being a two-year gap between seasons 2 and 3, you may be thinking that Bridgerton fans are used to it.\n\nWell, we're not. In a TV landscape where procedural dramas consist of seasons upwards of 20 episodes, new seasons coming out like clockwork every year and spin-offs being ordered left, right and centre, it just seems as though Bridgerton is dragging its heels.\n\nAfter this 2026 release date announcement, it's safe to say that the fans aren't happy. One fan wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter): \"Why does it take this show so long between seasons? Bigger shows turn s**t around in a year! Get it together Netflix!\"\n\nAnother underlined many fans' thoughts and wrote, \"All that for it to be 8 episodes and splited [sic] in 2 parts,\" while another user said, \"I guarantee you I will no longer be interested by that time.\"\n\nQuite frankly, it's questionable as to whether the wait for season 3 was even worth it at all. A long gap between seasons signals the creme de la creme of TV, the kind of show you have to wait for because it's so stellar. But mixed reviews, disappointing developments and, really, not enough Polin action for some means that Bridgerton season 3 will likely not go down as many people's favourite.\n\nMost importantly, though, a show that insists on taking such lengthy breaks loses its stamina and the interest of those who watch it. While it may be difficult to achieve the latter with the sheer loyalty of the Bridgerton fandom, there are some important season 3 finale developments that deserve their rightful airtime sooner rather than later.\n\nSince its first season, Bridgerton hasn't been a stranger to its fair share of (rightful) criticism levied against it for its lack of diversity, with the show accused of covering up its majority white leads with interracial relationships.\n\nThe subplot of the Mondriches this season gave us the Black love story many have been waiting for. While Will Mondrich (Martins Imhangbe) himself is based on an intriguing real-life figure, the family had better development this season but still remain painfully in the background.\n\nSimilarly, there have been calls for LGBTQ+ representation since the series first started airing, with fans continuing to ship the relationship between best friends Eloise and Penelope (Nicola Coughlan), leading many to believe that Eloise is the most queer-coded character in the Ton.\n\nWell, that all changes in the final episodes of Bridgerton season 3, as we not only see Benedict explore a sexual relationship with Paul and grow disappointed when he's not around, but we also have the first flames of a pretty noticeable spark between Francesca (Hannah Dodd) and Lord John Stirling's (Victor Alli) cousin, Michaela (Masali Baduza).\n\nFans of the original novels will know how Francesca's story pans out, with the Bridgerton daughter going on to suffer a tragic loss when John dies. But in the book, When He Was Wicked, Francesca finds love once again with John's cousin, Michael.\n\nWith the TV series having gender-flipped the role, it's already clear that Francesca was literally lost for words on meeting Michaela at the Dankworth-Finch ball in the finale.\n\nJust like Lady Violet (Ruth Gemmell) described being lost for words when she first met their father, it looks as though Francesca has taken after her mother, and was a blushing, stuttering ball of nerves upon meeting Michaela.\n\nAnd it's a confirmed love story that will be on the cards - whether it will be a blossoming storyline in season 4, though, we'll just have to wait and see.\n\nBrownell has spoken of Michaela's introduction in the series, telling Glamour: \"For many of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different is a part of our stories.

But I think for a lot of queer people, not every queer person, but a lot of queer people, that sense of feeling different from the time you're young, is part of our stories.

Whereas Francesca's book, \"When He Was Wicked,\" follows Francesca as she falls in love with John's cousin, Michael, following John's early death, \"Bridgerton\" Season 3 gender-swapped her love interest to become Michaela, revealing Francesca as a queer character.\n\n\"As a queer woman I really identified with her book. Her book talks a lot about how she feels different and doesn't know why,\" Brownell told TheWrap. \"I think Julia Quinn intended that to be more about the fact that she's more introverted than the rest of her family, but I think for many queer people, that sense of feeling different and like an outsider is something we carry with us from the time were young.\"\n\nBrownell noted adapting Francesca's story felt \"natural\" to \"not only to have a queer character on 'Bridgerton' for queer fans to see themselves in, but also to tell a story about the queer experience.\"\n\nWith Dodd entering the Netflix romance series as a newcomer after replacing Ruby Bridges, Brownell said the team was \"thoughtful\" to set her up as a queer character from the beginning of Season 3, when she doesn't relate to other debutantes' dreams of having a husband. Still, Brownell wanted to be sure Francesca's sexuality reveal doesn't invalidate her connection with John, on whom she could lean during the season's overwhelming moments.\n\n\"I want to be clear that we're not trying to undercut anything about her relationship with John,\" Brownell said. \"She has a real connection with him that is based in companionship, friendship, respect and common interests, and it is a very valid form of love. What we'll be continuing to explore for Francesca is more about how important or not passion is to her in a relationship.\"\n\nWhile it appears that Francesca and Michaela could lead Season 4, Brownell would not confirm nor deny if their story would be the center of the next installment, saying \"we're setting up lots of different threads that could lead to one of several characters being the lead for Season 4.\" Brownell said the announcement of whose love story Season 4 will follow would happen \"pretty soon\" following the release of Part 2.\n\nBelow, Brownell reveals why the series veered from the books following Penelope's Lady Whistledown reveal, how closely Francesca and Michaela's love story will follow her book and the anticipated release schedule for future seasons.\n\nWhat can you tease about Francesca and Michaela's love story?\n\nBook fans know where we're heading with that story. It's a tricky one to talk about, because there's a big twist in Francesca's book, and if people Google it, they'll know what is coming. We do plan to stick pretty closely to Francesca's book other than the gender-swap, there are certain elements of the book that will have to be altered. But actually, we found that we're able to adapt the book fairly accurately, so people can expect it to play out in a similar way.\n\nThe end of Season 3 leaves off with Penelope continuing to write her column. Why did you decide to veer from the books and keep her column going and how will her writing be incorporated into future seasons with her identity out in the open?\n\nAs we talked about where we wanted to end Penelope in the writers' room, it felt like, in a season where she's discovering the importance of her power, for her to then give up the column felt like it might be a down note. I think there's more to come with Lady Whistledown -- I think now Pen will have to navigate what it's like to be a public gossip columnist, not only dealing with the people she writes about, but also taking steps to be more accountable in what she writes. Accountability and authenticity are two things that she's had to really face this season, and we're gonna continue that thread going into Season 4.\n\nWill Penelope be more like a traditional journalist than a gossip columnist?\n\nThe show always lives in a place of gossip. It's still gossip, but we tried to make a point at the end of Season 3, that gossip gets a little bit of a bad reputation and that ... it can be information, especially for vulnerable people, like the young women in the ton, sharing information about the way certain men are treating other women or treating their staffs. Gossip can actually be used to correct some wrongs, and so hopefully going forward, you're going to see a more responsible version of Lady Whistledown who's who is using her pen to speak truth to power.\n\nPart 2 gives viewers the anticipated mirror scene, and I know Nicola mentioned wanting to be \"very naked\" in it. What went into crafting that scene?\n\nI'm really proud of that scene. This season, it was very important for us to shine a light on the fact that Penelope is feeling more ready to be seen, metaphorically and literally, in that scene. That is her arc in so many ways this season -- going from someone who hides on the wall to someone who, in Episode 8, is able to step into the center of things. Her nakedness in that scene is, actually, very representative of her taking a step on that journey, allowing herself and her body to be seen by the man she loves.\n\nThe Season 3 finale also addresses Agatha sleeping with Violet's father. Why did you want that acknowledgement to happen between them and how might it impact their relationship moving forward?\n\nShonda and I were talking fairly regularly as she was writing \"Queen Charlotte,\" and we definitely wanted to carry on some of the storylines and to acknowledge some of the growth and connections that were made in the spin-off, so it felt important to understand that these two friends weren't hiding secrets from each other. We've brought Agatha and Violet even closer this season, so it felt really nice for them to have that honest moment, and of course, it also feeds into Danbury giving her blessing of Violet's crush on Anderson.\n\nSeason 3 gave some humanity to Cressida, but her reputation seems beyond repair after her decisions. Where does her journey in the ton go from here?\n\nI don't think any reputations are forever beyond repair -- the Bridgertons, it seems like every season, get some mud slung at them, and they always pull through. So I'm rooting for Cressida, I think that she has a little bit more growth to do, but I am hoping to give her a happy ending as well. We're not done with that character quite yet.\n\nThere's also been some fan edits from Eloise and Cressida's friendship speculating that that could be more than a friendship. What have you thought of all of those?\n\nI love seeing all the different ships. It's not necessarily what we intended with Eloise and Cressida, but I totally understand why people have have read into it. They have a beautiful friendship and I do think that female friendship gets really underplayed on television, so when you do have these nice moments of female friendship, it's just such a delight to see. I think it's also a reflection of how hungry audiences have been to see queer relationships and queer stories on \"Bridgerton,\" so I'm really proud to be exploring that territory with Benedict and Francesca.\n\nHaving Penelope and Colin's story in Season 3, and veering away from the order of the books, has given the show more freedom to trace its own path, like with gender-swapping Michaela. How much farther could Bridgerton the show go in tracing its own path?\n\nShonda and I both feel strongly that we would love to have eight seasons and give every single sibling their own season -- that's the goal. Whether or not we will go out of order again, I don't know for sure. We'll be making more announcements about Season 4 soon, and I have an idea in the back of my head about where we're headed, at least in Seasons 5 and 6 if we get the chance to make those seasons.\n\nNow that we're through the strikes, do you anticipate being able to be on a yearly release schedule for new seasons or something close to it?\n\nI'll be honest, yearly is probably out of the cards. This is such a giant production. It is like making eight short feature films, just in terms of how many storylines we have to write, and then the production obviously is an enormous undertaking. We are doing everything in our power to start releasing seasons more quickly, but once a year might be a hard target to hit.\n\nDo you want to serve as showrunner for every season until the eight stories are told?\n\nI'm having the best time -- I love living in this world. If you have to spend years and years on one show, this is the show to do it on. It's just a happy place to be. So I have no plans of going anywhere currently.\n\n\"Queen Charlotte\" was such a hit. Are you planning on doing any other spin-offs or prequels for any other characters?\n\nI could watch a spin-off about really every single one of our characters. I loved the spin-off and had very little involvement in it other than talking with Shonda about how it would affect \"Bridgerton\" Season 3, so I leave that in Shonda's hands and I will be watching as a fan, and hoping for more spin-offs.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Her introduction confirmed that Francesca's original love interest Michael Stirling from Julia Quinn's When He Was Wicked novel has now been gender-swapped in the Netflix adaptation. Prior to this revelation, Bridgerton showrunner Jess Brownell previously teased the possibility of showing more queer love stories in future seasons of the popular romance drama. This would serve as one of the show's major departures from the source material.\n\nWhat to expect from Francesca's Love Story in future Bridgerton seasons?\n\nSpeaking with Deadline, Brownell explained their creative decision for changing Francesca's love story in future installments of Bridgerton, revealing that she had actually been pitching this change from the beginning.\n\n\"When I read her book, I, as a queer woman, really related to her book. Maybe in a way Julia Quinn didn't intend, but a lot of Francesca's book is about feeling different from her family and from the world around her and not really knowing why,\" Brownell said. \"In the book, I think it's mostly just about being introverted. But I think for a lot of queer people, not every queer person, but a lot of queer people, that sense of feeling different from the time you're young, is part of our stories. So it felt like a natural one to gender bend.\"\n\nSince most queer romances don't end well in period drama, some fans might be thinking that Francesca and Michaela's story won't have a happy ending. However, Brownell assured viewers that Francesca's love story will get her happy ending just like her siblings.\n\nShe added, \"There are certain elements of her story, historically, that allow us some wiggle room in terms of creating a happily ever after, which we very much want to have. I think when approaching a queer story, it's very important to me that in this world of happily ever afters that we are able to see a queer happily ever after and not let it be queer trauma.\"\n\nBased on Julia Quinn's bestselling novel series, Bridgerton is executive produced by Shonda Rhimes and showrunner Jess Brownell. It stars Nicola Coughlan, Luke Newton, Golda Rosheuvel, Jonathan Bailey, Claudia Jessie, Ruby Barker, Sabrina Bartlett, Ruth Gemmell, Adjoa Andoh, Polly Walker, Bessie Carter, Simone Ashley, and Harriet Cains, with Julie Andrews as the voice of Lady Whistledown.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maggie_dela_paz@comingsoon.net", "name": "Maggie Dela Paz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Quinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julia Quinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Barker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruby Barker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golda_Rosheuvel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golda Rosheuvel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Ashley", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simone Ashley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Cains", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harriet Cains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bessie_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bessie Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Historical drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Bartlett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Bartlett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudia_Jessie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Claudia Jessie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Gemmell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruth Gemmell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Polly Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Coughlan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicola Coughlan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjoa_Andoh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adjoa Andoh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shonda_Rhimes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shonda Rhimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Julie Andrews"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Stories", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Coming Out", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/bridgerton-francesca.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

It feels fair to say that.\n\nAfter all, the series has already figured out a surprising way in which to shake things up when it comes to Francesca's story moving forward. Book readers know that this character eventually falls for John Stirling's cousin Michael. However, here the show has changed Michael to Michaela and with that, delivered its first potential same-sex couple.\n\nWhile the entire love story has yet to play out, it is abundantly clear that this is the direction that the series is heading in. Why make this move now? In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, executive producer Jess Brownell does her best to explain:\n\n\"When I first read When He Was Wicked in the lead up to season 1, I really related to it as a queer woman ... There's some themes in that book about Francesca feeling different. Julia Quinn just means it in terms of her being an introvert. But for a lot of us in the queer community, that sense of feeling different from a young age is a part of our stories. So, I felt like there was good thematic resonance telling a queer story with Francesca.\n\n\"And I didn't want to just insert a queer character to check a box. I really wanted to tell a story about a portion of the queer experience. There's also a certain piece of Francesca's story historically that allows us to ensure a happily ever after for her and Michaela. It was really important for me in crafting a main queer story for us to give that couple a happy ending just like every other couple.\"\n\nOf course, we hope that there are opportunities aplenty to see this relationship explored in due time, but whether or not that is season 4 remains to be seen. It is absolutely a possibility but at this point, it is far from the only possibility.\n\nRelated - You will be waiting a good while to see Bridgerton season 4 arrive\n\nShare right now in the attached comments!

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe finale, released on Thursday, features the first appearance of John Stirling's (Victor Alli) cousin, Michaela Stirling (Masali Baduza). The cameo from John's relative is significant because it's one of the many ways the show diverges from Quinn's book series, by setting up a queer romance for Francesca Bridgerton (Hannah Dodd).\n\nHere's what you need to know about Baduza, the newest \"Bridgerton\" cast member.\n\nThe South African actor graduated with an associate of fine arts (AFA) degree in 2016. Other notable NYFA alums include Issa Rae and Aubrey Plaza.\n\nSince graduating, Baduza has acted in theater productions, TV shows, and movies.\n\nBaduza made her film debut in the 2019 movie \"Bhai's Cafe.\" After a few roles in shorts and TV shows, including BBC's drama series \"Noughts + Crosses,\" the actor landed a part in the 2022 film \"The Woman King\" starring Viola Davis.\n\nBaduza played Fumbe, a member of the movie's all-female army.\n\nIn the \"Bridgerton\" books, John dies two years into his marriage to Francesca and his cousin Michael becomes the new Earl of Kilmartin. Years pass before Francesca and Michael reconnect and explore their feelings for each other, leading to marriage and two children.\n\nSince Michael has been gender-flipped for the TV show adaptation, Francesca's love story will probably play out much differently.\n\nIn an interview with Glamour, \"Bridgerton\" showrunner Jess Brownell said that they \"flew her out the moment we saw her tape to do a chemistry read with Hannah.\"\n\n\"She absolutely nailed it,\" Brownell said, adding that Dodd was keen on Baduza being cast after meeting her.\n\n\"I remember the moment Hannah met Masali,\" Brownell recalled. \"After Masali left, she said, 'Well, that's her.' Hannah could feel it. She is an incredible actress, and she and I have had a lot of talks about the weight and importance of her role. She's really stepped into it with wonderful energy.\"", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_singh@businessinsider.com", "name": "Olivia Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masali_Baduza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Masali Baduza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noughts_+_Crosses", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Noughts + Crosses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Film Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Woman_King", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Woman King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issa_Rae", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Issa Rae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Plaza", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aubrey Plaza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associate degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_Davis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viola Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/666b3225764df1611259a1c7?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

I understand that people are going to have feelings about the fact that this character won't appear exactly as they expected. But first of all, we are going to try to honor the themes of the book as much as possible. Obviously, some changes will have to be made to the storyline, but there are ways to honor a lot of the book. I would also just say that the book still stands. Michael Stirling still exists in book world. Whereas, queer audiences haven't gotten the chance to see themselves represented in a major way on the show, which is a show that is in so many other ways so inclusive. So I would just ask people to channel some empathy for those viewers, and to understand the importance of us allowing those viewers to see themselves represented.\n\nMore to come...\n\nSource: Glamour", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brennan_klein@screenrant.com", "name": "Brennan Klein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "dalton_norman@screenrant.com", "name": "Dalton Norman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "megan_hemenway@screenrant.com", "name": "Megan Hemenway", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "hannah_gearan@screenrant.com", "name": "Hannah Gearan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgerton", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgerton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things_(season_3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stranger Things (season 3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_novel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance novel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Showrunner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicked (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glamour (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Books", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Genres", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Books", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/untitled-27.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9649422", "eventUri": "eng-9649422", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

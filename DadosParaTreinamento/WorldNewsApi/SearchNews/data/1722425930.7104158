{"id": 243250028, "title": "Ram Madhav writes: A growing China and the India-US coming together", "text": "India and the United States of America have been close allies for more than two decades. India recently elected the Narendra Modi-led government for the third consecutive term. In the US, the presidential elections are scheduled for November and a new government led by Joe Biden or Donald Trump will be in place in January next year. Either way, it will be a continuation of the relations built by Modi in the last 10 years. Jawaharlal Nehru had the opportunity to meet three presidents \u2014 Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower and John F Kennedy. In a decade of his tenure, Modi has already met three American presidents \u2013 Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden. He waits to meet the one among the latter two who gets a second tenure. Although India and the US established diplomatic ties soon after Independence, the relationship had to endure Cold War era distrust and American wrath over India\u2019s nuclear programme. The Americans wanted the former British colony to become their ally. Nehru\u2019s refusal to do so and his pursuit of an independent foreign policy of non-alignment didn\u2019t go down well with successive US administrations. Although the Kennedy government was helpful during the Indo-China war of 1962, and the US extended assistance for India\u2019s Green Revolution, President Richard Nixon openly sided with Pakistan and China during the crucial years of 1969-74. Indira Gandhi\u2019s decision to test the first nuclear device in 1974 angered the American leadership, which continued through Bill Clinton\u2019s years in office when India tested a more powerful device during Atal Bihari Vajpayee\u2019s regime in 1998. Credit for steadying the relationship goes to Vajpayee as the prime minister. Although the Clinton administration imposed serious sanctions in multiple areas after the Vajpayee government conducted nuclear tests, Clinton\u2019s visit to New Delhi in March 2000 and Vajpayee\u2019s deft diplomatic handling helped diffuse the situation. The first major breakthrough happened in the form of a vision document released jointly by the two leaders. \"We are nations forged from many traditions and faiths, proving year after year that diversity is our strength. From vastly different origins and experiences, we have come to the same conclusions: that freedom and democracy are the strongest bases for both peace and prosperity and that they are universal aspirations, constrained neither by culture nor levels of economic development\u201d, that statement read. Later that year, Vajpayee was in New York for the UN General Assembly where he addressed the Asiatic Society. His famous statement that India and US were \u201cnatural allies\u201d became the basis for the new relationship in later years. During his visit to the US in 2013, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described the US-India partnership in the joint statement with President Obama as \u201ca defining one for the 21st century.\u201d Under Prime Minister Modi, this relationship has acquired greater momentum. Modi is the only Indian prime minister to have visited the USA eight times in 10 years. In their joint statement last June, Modi and Biden affirmed a vision of the US and India as \u201camong the closest partners in the world \u2014 a partnership of democracies looking into the 21st century with hope, ambition, and confidence\u201d. From \u201cnatural allies\u201d to \u201chope, ambition and confidence\u201d is a great journey of the bilateral partnership, which Modi described as one spanning from the \u201cseas to the stars\u201d. As the two governments embark on their new journeys, this relationship faces an important test. There are issues on both sides that cause unease. India\u2019s insistence on \u201cstrategic autonomy\u201d is raising hackles in foreign policy circles in the US. India\u2019s steadfast refusal to consider the Quad as a maritime alliance, something like an Indo-Pacific NATO, too is making sections of the American establishment squirm. While there is palpable enthusiasm on the Indian side over the security and development potential of the Quad, the other side appears to see greater merit in pursuing the AUKUS agenda more vigorously. Biden\u2019s decision to pull out of the Quad summit in Australia last year and not visit India in January this year for another possible Quad summit led to commentators suspecting deliberate neglect of the arrangement by the US leadership. At the same time, AUKUS is rapidly growing as an area of greater strategic interest for Australia, the US and Japan. The latest Defence White Paper released by the Australian government speaks at length about cooperation in AUKUS but has a cursory mention of the Quad. The possible expansion of AUKUS will also redefine the partnerships among Quad nations. India\u2019s other concerns were highlighted in a speech by foreign minister Jaishankar at the UN last September. \u201cFrom time to time, respect for the UN charter is invoked. But for all the talk, it is still a few nations who set the agenda and seek to define the norms. This cannot go on indefinitely\u201d, Jaishankar lashed out in an address, which some called \u201cbold\u201d while others saw in it India\u2019s growing \u201cbelligerence\u201d. In a clear message to the West over the much-touted argument about \u201crules-based order\u201d, Jaishankar cautioned that \u201crule makers should not subjugate rule takers\u201d and \u201crules will work only when they apply equally to all\u201d. Indirectly referring to the turn taken by the Khalistan issue in the US and Canada, he came down heavily, saying that \u201cpolitical convenience\u201d is determining responses to terrorism and extremism. \u201cWhen reality departs from the rhetoric, we must have the courage to call it out\u201d, he said, highlighting the \u201csentiment of the Global South\u201d that \u201cwithout genuine solidarity, there can never be trust\u201d. Growing global challenges, including the rise of China and the unfolding new Cold War-like situation call for greater understanding and coordinated action between the US and India \u2014 two powers committed to the same ideals in two different geo-strategic locations. That understanding will decide the future trajectory of the relationship.

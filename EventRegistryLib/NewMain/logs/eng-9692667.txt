Even I learned a lot from Venkaiah ji,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nPM Modi said that the life of Venkaiah Naidu is a perfect glimpse of the amalgamation of ideas, vision and personality.\n\nHe also expressed happiness about the current state of BJP and Jana Sangh in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as compared to how it was decades ago without any strong foundation.\n\n\"Despite such lacunae, Naidu strived in his role as an ABVP Karyakarta with the ideology of 'Nation First' and had made up his mind to achieve something for the nation,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nHe also lauded Naidu for his fighting tooth and nail against the Emergency, which was imposed 50 years ago in the nation, despite being imprisoned for about 17 months.\n\nPM Modi said that Naidu was one such braveheart who was tried and tested during the wrath of Emergency and that is the reason he considers Naidu as a true friend.\n\nPM Modi said that Naidu also proved himself when he got the opportunity to become a part of the Vajpayee government where he chose to become the Union Minister for Rural Development.\n\n\"Naidu ji wanted to serve the villages, the poor and the farmers,\" PM Modi said.\n\nPM Modi said that the former Vice President also worked as a Union Minister during his first term for urban development and lauded his commitment and vision for modern Indian cities.\n\nPraising the former Vice President's soft mild-mannerism, eloquence and wit, the Prime Minister recalled that no one can match Venkaiah Naidu's level of wit, spontaneity, quick counters and one-liners.\n\nPM Modi also recalled the slogan coined by Naidu during the formation of Atal Bihari Vajpayee's coalition government, \"Ek haath mein BJP ka jhanda, aur dusre haath mein NDA ka agenda\" (Party's flag in one hand and the National Democratic Alliance's agenda in the other).\n\nIn 2014, the former Vice President also introduced the acronym 'Making of Developed India' for M.O.D.I. The Prime Minister said he was surprised by Venkaiah's ruminations, compelling him to praise his style in the Rajya Sabha once where he said that there is depth, seriousness, vision, beat, bounce and wisdom in the former Vice President's words.\n\nThe Prime Minister also hailed the positive environment created by Naidu during his tenure as Speaker of the Rajya Sabha and highlighted the various important decisions taken by the House.\n\nRecalling the introduction of the bill to revoke Article 370 in the Rajya Sabha before being tabled in the Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister lauded Naidu's experienced leadership in the passage of such a sensitive bill while maintaining the decorum of the House. The Prime Minister wished for a long, active and healthy life for Naidu.\n\nPM Modi also threw light on the emotional side of Venkaiah's nature and informed that he never let adversities affect his decision-making.\n\nHe also highlighted his simple way of living and his special ways of keeping in touch with people. PM Modi also recalled spending time at Venkaiah's residence during festivities.\n\nThe Prime Minister concluded his address by reminiscing and reciting a few lines of a poem which he had dedicated to Naidu in the Rajya Sabha once.\n\nPM Modi once again congratulated and wished the former Vice President Venkaiah Naidu on completing 75 years of his life's journey.\n\nPM Modi also expressed

We should not be tempted by these freebies and then make the people lazy. Yes, we must give them a helping hand. You have been giving free ration to crores of people across the country. That should continue as long as it is required. But, at the same time, skill development is the need of the hour,\" the former Vice President said.\n\nNaidu also favoured promoting Indian languages.\n\nThe books released by the PM include biography of the former Vice President titled \"Venkaiah Naidu - Life in Service,\" \"Celebrating Bharat - The Mission and Message of Shri M Venkaiah Naidu as 13th Vice-President of India\", a photo chronicle and a pictorial biography in Telugu titled \"Mahaneta - Life and Journey of Shri M.

He expressed confidence that these books will become a source of inspiration for the people while also illuminating the correct path to serving the nation.\n\nReminiscing about his long association with the former Vice-President, the PM said he had the opportunity to work with Mr Naidu for a long period. This collaboration began during Mr Naidu's tenure as the national president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), followed by his senior role in the Cabinet, his tenure as the Vice-President of the country, and later as the Speaker of the Rajya Sabha. \"One can imagine the wealth of experience a person hailing from a small village may have gathered while holding such significant posts. Even I learned a lot from Venkaiah ji\", he added.\n\nMr Modi said the life of Venkaiah Naidu ji is a perfect glimpse of the amalgamation of ideas, vision and personality. He expressed happiness about the current state of BJP and Jana Sangh in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana as compared to how it was decades ago without any strong foundation. He said, \"Despite such lacunae, Mr Naidu strived in his role as an ABVP Karyakarta with the ideology of \"Nation First\" and had made up his mind to achieve something for the nation.\"\n\nThe PM lauded Mr Naidu for his fighting tooth and nail against the Emergency, which was imposed 50 years ago in the nation, despite being imprisoned for about 17 months. He also underlined that Mr Naidu was one such braveheart who was tried and tested during the wrath of Emergency and that is the reason he considers the latter as a true friend.\n\nUnderling that power does not reflect the comforts of life but is the medium to accomplish the resolutions by service, the PM said that Mr Naidu proved himself when he got the opportunity to become a part of the Vajpayee Government where he chose to become the Union Minister for Rural Development. \"Naidu ji wanted to serve the villages, the poor and the farmers,\" he added. He further added that Mr Naidu worked as a Union Minister for Urban Development in the Modi Government and lauded his commitment and vision for modern Indian cities.

Venkaiah Naidu Garu turns 75. I wish him a long and healthy life and also extend my greetings to all his well-wishers and supporters. This is an occasion to celebrate a leader whose life journey showcases dedication, adaptability and an unwavering commitment to public service. From his early days in the political arena to his tenure as Vice President, Venkaiah Garu's career exemplifies his unique ability to navigate the complexities of Indian politics with ease and humility. His eloquence, wit and steadfast focus on developmental issues have earned him respect across party lines.\n\nVenkaiah Garu and I have been associated with each other for decades. We have worked together and I have also learnt a lot from him. If there is one thing that has remained common in his life, it is the love for people. His brush with activism and politics began in Andhra Pradesh with student politics as a student leader. Considering his talent, oratory and organisational skills, he would have been welcomed in any political party but he preferred to work with the Sangh Parivar because he was inspired by the vision of Nation First. He was associated with the RSS, ABVP and then strengthened the Jana Sangh and the BJP.\n\nWhen the Emergency was imposed almost 50 years ago, young Venkaiah Garu immersed himself in the anti-Emergency movement. He was imprisoned and that too for inviting Loknayak JP to Andhra Pradesh. This commitment to democracy would be seen time and again in his political career. In the mid-1980s, when the great NTR's Government was unceremoniously dismissed by the Congress, he was again at the forefront of the movement to protect democratic principles.\n\nVenkaiah Garu has always been comfortable swimming even against the most formidable tides. In 1978, Andhra Pradesh voted for the Congress but he beat the trend and was elected as a young MLA. Five years later, when the NTR Tsunami swept the state, he got elected as a BJP MLA, thus paving the way for the BJP's growth across the state.\n\nAll those who have heard Venkaiah Garu speak will vouch for his oratory skills. He is certainly a wordsmith but he is as much a worksmith. Since his days as a young MLA, he began to be respected for the rigour he put in to legislative affairs and speaking for people of his constituency. No less than a stalwart like NTR noted his talent and even wanted him to join his Party but Venkaiah Garu refused to deviate from his core ideology. He went on to play a big role in strengthening the BJP in Andhra Pradesh, going across the villages and connecting with people from all walks of life. He led the Party on the floor of the Assembly and even became the AP BJP President.\n\nIt was in the 1990s that the BJP central leadership took note of Venkaiah Garu's efforts and thus in 1993 began his stint in national politics when he was appointed the Party's All India General Secretary. It was truly a remarkable moment for a man, who as a teenager would go around announcing the visits of Atal Ji and Advani Ji, to be working directly with them. As the General Secretary, he was focused on how to bring our Party to power and ensure that the nation get their first ever BJP Prime Minister. After the move to Delhi, there was no looking back and he rose to become the National President of the Party.\n\nIn 2000, when Atal Ji was keen to induct Venkaiah Garu in the government as a Minister, Venkaiah Garu instantly conveyed his preference for the Rural Development Ministry. This left everyone including Atal Ji puzzled. After all, here was a leader who was being asked which portfolio he wants and his first choice was Rural Development. But, Venkaiah Garu was clear- he was a Kisan Putra, he had spent his early days in the villages and thus, if there was one area he wished to work, it was rural development. As Minister, he was closely associated with the conception and rolling out of the 'Pradhan Mantri Gramin Sadak Yojana.' Years later, when the NDA Government of 2014 assumed office, he handled the crucial portfolios of Urban Development, Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation. It was during his tenure that we launched the important Swachh Bharat Mission and important urban development related schemes. Perhaps, he is one of the only leaders to have worked for both rural and urban development for such an extensive period.\n\nWhen I came to Delhi in 2014, I was an outsider to the national capital, having worked in Gujarat for the previous decade and a half. In such times, Venkaiah Garu's insights were very handy. He was an effective Parliamentary Affairs Minister - he knew the essence of bipartisanship but at the same time he drew a line when it came to Parliamentary norms and rules.\n\nIn 2017, our Alliance nominated him as our Vice-Presidential candidate. We faced a dilemma - we thought about how the big shoes of Venkaiah Garu would be impossible to fill, but at the same time, we also knew there was no better candidate for the Vice Presidency than him. I can never forget one of the speeches he gave when he resigned as Minister and MP. He could not control his tears when he recalled his association with the Party and efforts to build it. It gave a glimpse of his deep-rooted commitment and passion. Upon becoming the Vice President, he undertook various steps that also enhanced the dignity of the office. He was an outstanding Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha, ensuring that young MPs, women MPs and first time MPs get the opportunity to speak. He put great emphasis on attendance, making the Committees more effective and also raising the level of debate in the House.\n\nWhen the decision to remove Articles 370 and 35(A) were placed on the floor of the Rajya Sabha, it was Venkaiah Garu who was on the Chair.

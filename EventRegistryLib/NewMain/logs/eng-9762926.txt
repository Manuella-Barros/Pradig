Before you grab your tickets, here's everything you need to know, including the audience rating, runtime, and the number of post-credit scenes fans can expect.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is the third film in the Deadpool franchise and the first under the MCU since Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox in 2019. The movie sees Deadpool and Logan reunite after fans first saw the Marvel characters battle it out in the X-Men spinoff X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009. Deadpool's messy introduction in that film inspired Reynolds to re-launch his character, resulting in the widely successful Deadpool franchise in 2016.\n\nThis film is the only MCU release slated for 2024. Marvel Studios is scaling back its output after several box office disappointments, with The Marvels (2023) being the most recent failure. As \"superhero fatigue\" affects projects across both the MCU and DC, the slower release strategy might ultimately benefit the franchise in the long run.\n\nBased on the teaser clips and official trailer, Deadpool & Wolverine will see Deadpool and Wolverine team up to save the world and perhaps the entire multiverse. Director Shawn Levy shared on Good Morning America that the film centers around a \"surprising friendship.\"\n\nThe filmmaker said there is \"definitely the action and the spectacle, but I think what maybe people are expecting a little less is the warmth of this movie.\" He continued, \"Because it really was a movie made by friends about friendship. You have these two characters who really don't match up in an easy way, but, eventually, through a lot of conflict, find something of a surprising friendship.\"\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nGoogle Confirms Bad News For 3 Billion Chrome Users -- You Will Still Be Tracked\n\nFC Barcelona Announces Another New Transfer\n\nToday's NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Thursday, July 25\n\nRead on to learn what to know before you watch Deadpool & Wolverine in the theaters.\n\nWhat Rating Is Deadpool and Wolverine?\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine has been officially rated R for \"strong bloody violence and language throughout, gore and sexual references.\" The first two Deadpool movies released by 20th Century Fox were rated R, but this marks the first for the MCU since the franchise moved under Disney after Disney's 2019 acquisition of the studio.\n\nAccording to The New York Post, there are more than 100 uses of the F-word in Deadpool & Wolverine. Before this film, the MCU had one other use of the swear word in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.\n\nReynolds told Variety in May that he was shocked they were allowed to make an R-rated Deadpool movie for Disney. \"I was surprised though, that they let us go as hard R, but very grateful,\" he said. \"I mean there's no other way to do it.\"\n\nViewers should be aware that there are sustained fight scenes involving blood, characters getting impaled, and multiple skeletons. There are several moments involving explicit depictions of sexual behavior and desire, as well as conversations about drug use.\n\nThe age requirement to watch an R-rated movie varies. Typically, those under 17 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian who is at least 25 years old. In most theaters, children under the age of 6 are not admitted to R-rated movies.\n\nHow Long Is Deadpool & Wolverine?\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is two hours and seven minutes, or 127 minutes, making its sequel the longest film of the Deadpool trilogy. The film's run time is close to Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, which it surpasses by three minutes. Check out the run times for the past two Deadpool films below.\n\nDeadpool (2016): 108 minutes. Deadpool 2 (2018): 119 minutes.\n\nHow Many Post-Credits Scenes Does Deadpool & Wolverine Have?\n\nThere is one post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool & Wolverine. While it doesn't tease another chapter, timeline, or character in the MCU, the end credits serve as an emotional and nostalgic moment for which fans will want to stay in their seats.\n\nReynolds initially teased that Deadpool wouldn't have an post-credits scenes. Hidden in the Deadpool & Wolverine teaser, fans discovered a QR code that links viewers to a \"disclaimer\" video hosted on Reynolds's personal YouTube channel. In the clip, the Deadpool star explained what viewers could expect from the film, adding that they will \"completely sidestep Marvel's mandated after-credits sequence.\"\n\nThe previous films in the franchise, Deadpool and Deadpool 2, also both also only have one post-credit scene at the end of the credits.\n\nWatch the official trailer for Deadpool & Wolverine below.", "source": {"uri":

I am actually not joking,\" Reynolds told co-star Hugh Jackman while filling in as guest co-hosts on Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"On the eve of the Super Bowl, the Super Bowl is where we first launched the trailer for Deadpool & -- not Friend, but Wolverine -- it leaked because of the son of the bitches on the internet.

And they did it, they did it. They really changed the title,\" Reynolds added.\n\nDeadpool & Friend being the original title of Deadpool & Wolverine does make a joke that Jackman made on social media shortly after the Super Bowl trailer premiered a lot funnier. On X, Jackman posted a corrected title card for the Marvel movie that read, \"Wolverine & Asshole,\" which was likely created in advance of the title change to poke fun at the Deadpool & Friend title.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Brings the Titular Duo Into the MCU\n\nSet six years after the events of 2018's Deadpool 2, Deadpool & Wolverine begins with Wade Wilson living a low-key life as a car salesman. However, he is soon snatched from his simple life by Time Variance Authority agents and sent on a mission by Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) to save the multiverse. Aiding him on this mission is a Wolverine variant portrayed by Jackman. Deadpool & Wolverine is the first X-Men-related movie produced by Marvel Studios and the first entry to be released as part of the MCU.\n\nRelated\n\nDeadpool 3 Was Nearly Shelved Before Last-Minute Phone Call From Hugh Jackman\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Shawn Levy was just about to tell Kevin Feige that Deadpool 3 needed to be shelved when a surprise phone call came in.\n\nClose\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Is About to Make All the Money\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is currently tracking towards a massive opening weekend, with the superhero movie expected to gross between $160 million and $165 million domestically at the box office between July 26 and 28.

This article contains spoilers for Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nSummary\n\nLady Deadpool's identity in Deadpool & Wolverine is finally revealed. Deadpool & Wolverine bids farewell to the early Marvel era, setting the stage for the MCU's future. The casting as Lady Deadpool pays tribute to her and Ryan Reynolds' real-life chemistry.\n\nThe identity of Lady Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine has finally been revealed after months of intense speculation. Since Lady Deadpool (sometimes referred to as Ladypool) dramatically appeared in a trailer for the MCU's Deadpool & Wolverine, there have been several theories proffered regarding her identity. The wildest Deadpool & Wolverine theories included Taylor Swift and even Ryan Reynolds himself, but the actual actor is perhaps even more perfect.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine bids a fond farewell to the early era of Marvel movies, particularly those released by 20th Century Fox. Simultaneously, the narrative has overarching consequences for the MCU's future. Fittingly, the movie included a wealth of cameos from the MCU timeline and beyond, including Ladypool. Though Reynolds denied any knowledge of Lady Deadpool's identity, the woman behind the mask was the ideal choice.\n\nRelated\n\nIs Deadpool & Wolverine Family Friendly? Just How R Rated Is It?\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is the MCU's first R-rated movie, but just how much does the movie earn its rating and is it even slightly family-friendly?\n\nBlake Lively Plays Lady Deadpool In Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nLady Deadpool appears towards the end of Deadpool & Wolverine as the titular duo face an army of Deadpool variants. Despite the fervor online to discern her identity, the character doesn't actually remove her mask during the movie. However, the cast listing on IMDB confirms that it is Blake Lively who plays this mysterious Deadpool variant.\n\nLady Deadpool appears during the thrilling battle with the many Deadpool variants and is the first to step through the portal. Lady Deadpool struts majestically through the smoke with her famed ponytail poking out through the top of her mask. This prompts a stunned Deadpool to gawk at the variant, clearly stunned by her beguiling presence.\n\nRelated\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Review: The MCU Multiverse Movie I've Been Waiting For\n\nLed by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman at the top of their superhero game, Deadpool & Wolverine is an absurd blast of a Marvel multiverse joyride.\n\nWhy Blake Lively Was The Perfect Choice For Lady Deadpool\n\nClose\n\nBlake Lively's casting as Lady Deadpool is an inspired choice for several reasons. Her acting career has been marked by a range of diverse and memorable roles, from her breakout in Gossip Girl to her critically acclaimed role in The Age of Adaline. She has proven her ability to handle both dramatic and action-oriented roles, making her well-suited to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of a character like Lady Deadpool.\n\nMore pertinently, Blake Lively is married to Ryan Reynolds, and in many ways could be considered the female variant of Reynolds. Their playful interactions on social media have already shown the world their comedic rapport, making her role in Deadpool & Wolverine a perfect extension of their public personas. Indeed, Lively's participation in the film becomes a meta-commentary on their real-life chemistry.\n\nRelated\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Post-Credits Scenes Explained\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine has two credits scenes, so we break down what they both mean for the future and historic legacy of Marvel movies.\n\nThis is bolstered by the fact that all other Deadpool variants are enamored by Lady Deadpool. This continues the trend of Deadpool movies commenting on Reynolds' professional and private life, applying his real-world love for Lively to an entire multiverse of Deadpool variants. It serves as a tribute to Reynolds' wife and their marriage, and was one of the most satisfying cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nR\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth.

This article contains spoilers for Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nSummary Deadpool 4 has not been confirmed by Marvel, leaving the character's return uncertain. Potential story details suggest Deadpool 4 could explore joining the X-Men in the MCU. Deadpool could show up in the MCU in big team-up movies like Avengers: Secret Wars or an upcoming X-Men film.\n\nWith Deadpool's threequel, Deadpool & Wolverine finally released, it's worth looking ahead at where the story could go in the future and if Deadpool will return for a Deadpool 4. The MCU has always made the most of the characters on its roster. Before Robert Downey Jr. retired from his role as Tony Stark, he appeared in nine different movies, three of which had his character as the title hero. Other heroes, like Thor, have appeared in four movies which were just in his own primary franchise.\n\nOf course, Ryan Reynolds has already appeared as Deadpool in three franchise films, and Reynolds also debuted a divisive portrayal of the Merc with the Mouth in 2009s X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Over that time, Deadpool has become one of the most beloved and exciting heroes in any Marvel movie, even beyond the MCU. That being said, now that Deadpool has finally made his way to the MCU, it's inevitable that fans of the anti-hero will be anxiously looking for where and when the character could return, if he returns at all.\n\nDeadpool 4 Has Not Been Confirmed By Marvel Marvel Has Plans For Many Years Ahead Close\n\nAll of that being said, Marvel hasn't officially confirmed or announced anything to do with the character's future. While heroes in the MCU are utilized to their absolute maximum potential across movies, sequels within any given franchise take time to be released. From the first Thor movie, to Thor: Love and Thunder, there was an 11-year gap. Ant-Man appeared later in the MCU, with his first movie being released in 2015, but even to complete his trilogy with Ant-Man: Quantumania, it took eight years.\n\nDespite this, Marvel does create plans that cover several years into the future, with most of their big Phase announcements coming during huge events like San Diego Comic Con. If there is a future for the hero, it's likely he will have a cameo somewhere before a Deadpool 4 is created. But, once the mutants all settle into the MCU, there is every possibility that Marvel Studios will call on Ryan Reynolds to don the red suit once again. However, until something official comes out, all of this is hypothetical, and the fourth movie remains a hopeful dream.\n\nRelated Who Plays Lady Deadpool In Deadpool & Wolverine?\n\nAfter months of speculation, Lady Deadpool's identity in Deadpool & Wolverine has been revealed, and it's even more perfect than we thought.\n\nDeadpool 4 Cast Info Who Stars In Deadpool 4 Close\n\nWhile there is no certainty as to whether there will be a fourth movie, there are elements that a hypothetical Deadpool 4 would likely include. For example, the cast is likely to feature some key figures, starting with Wade Wilson himself. As of the end of Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool is alive and well, and his family of nine beloved close friends has grown slightly. In addition to Deadpool's ex-girlfriend, whom he clearly still has a shot with, Deadpool has friends like Dopinder, Peter, and Blind Al, who have been staples in the franchise to date.\n\nAside from those individuals who are almost certain to return, Deadpool now has his potential best friend, Wolverine, in his circle of friends, along with his quasi-daughter figure, X-23. While it is possible that Wolverine will forge his own path and continue his lone wolf lifestyle, this Wolverine learned the value of friendship and team work, and it would make sense for him to return. But, that could also minimize the impact of Deadpool & Wolverine as a wish-fulfillment movie. For that reason, it is more likely that a Deadpool 4 movie would lean further into the mutants in the MCU storyline, and it could finally explore Deadpool becoming a member of the X-Men, or at least an honorary member for some special mission.\n\nDeadpool 4 Potential Story Details Where Does Deadpool Go From Here Close\n\nDeadpool 4's story is dependent in some ways on where it slots into the MCU. For Deadpool & Wolverine, it was fortunate in the fact that it was able to work on the outside of the Sacred Timeline, while flirting with that line through the TVA. Of course, Deadpool saved his timeline from destruction by securing a new anchor being, but, that doesn't mean he can't still cross over into the MCU proper. Especially with characters like America Chavez floating around the multiverse.\n\nDeadpool 4 would likely still be about Deadpool being a reluctant hero. It would likely include cameos from other big talent for Deadpool to make witty fourth wall breaking commentary about. And, it could finally see Deadpool joining a big superhero team, like the Avengers or the X-Men. Deadpool has found a family, and his life will always revolve around protecting those people from harm, but the specifics of where the story could go are perhaps more malleable and full of potential than most other MCU titles.\n\nRelated Ryan Reynolds & Wesley Snipes Had A Legendary Feud On The Set Of This Forgotten Marvel Movie\n\nBlade: Trinity had an infamous production, marked by several feuds including one between Reynolds and Snipes that has finally been addressed.\n\nWhere Else Deadpool Could Show Up In The MCU Deadpool Could Return Elsewhere In The MCU Close\n\nHowever, something like a big team up with the Avengers could be a more likely possibility in other MCU movies. As mentioned above, Marvel uses their actors and characters across a lot more than their own primary franchise. So, if Deadpool is to return any time soon, it is likely that he will show up somewhere where the Multiverse appears to be colliding. For this reason, a movie like Avengers: Secret Wars could be the perfect place for Deadpool to appear. Likewise, the hero could appear in Avengers 5, which is now undergoing some changes after the Kang storyline has been moved away from.\n\nIf not in either of the Avengers movies, Deadpool is an integral part of the mutant story who has shaped the timeline of the Fox X-Men universe and beyond. A Marvel X-Men movie is expected to appear on the slate sooner rather than later, and this could be the perfect place for Wade to come back and usher in the mutant era within the MCU. Deadpool 4 could be the next time the character appears, if that movie ever happens, but after Deadpool & Wolverine, the potential and possibilities for the hero are practically endless, and he could make a great addition almost anywhere else.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine RAction Sci-FiComedySuperhero\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth.

Deadpool & Wolverine is currently up on Rotten Tomatoes with a \"Certified Fresh\" critics score of 81%, and ComicBook's Jenna Anderson gave the threequel a 4.5 out of 5 and called it a \"maniacal, meaningful masterpiece.\" If you're heading to the theater to see the latest Marvel project, you're probably wondering if you should stick around for the end credits. Well, this is Deadpool's first Marvel Cinematic Universe entry, so the answer is unsurprisingly, \"Yes.\" Deadpool & Wolverine does have a post-credits scene in addition to a lovely surprise during the credits.\n\nWhen Deadpool & Wolverine comes to an end, the credits feature a very sentimental look at some of 20th Century Fox's Marvel films. Of course, the franchise started with X-Men in 2000, which marked the first appearance by Jackman as Wolverine. Over the years, there have been many X-Men movies in addition to other Marvel features, and they were all represented...\n\nWhy Does Deadpool & Wolverine Pay Tribute to the Fox Universe?\n\nDisney bought Fox back in 2019, which mostly put an end to the Fox Universe. Deadpool & Wolverine pays tribute to all of the Fox films in some very surprising ways, and while some of Fox's Marvel movies were notorious flops, the end credits of Deadpool & Wolverine don't shy away from any projects. No matter how you feel about some of the showcased movies, you can't help but get a little emotional as the tribute plays on.\n\nThe end credits include behind-the-scenes footage from everything ranging from X-Men to Elektra to Fantastic Four (2005). The younger and older casts of the X-Men films are represented, and even the Fantastic Four film from 2015 got some love. These credits feel like a goodbye, but there's still a chance some of the characters from this world could appear in future MCU projects.\n\nWhile the credits are surprisingly soft for a Deadpool movie, the post-credit scene takes you right back to that rude and crude humor fans know and love. Here's what happens in the final moment of the film...\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine's Post-Credits Scene Explained\n\nWarning: Major spoilers ahead for Deadpool & Wolverine... One of the biggest surprises of the movie was the appearance of Chris Evans as Johnny Storm. The actor played the Human Torch in Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) before he went on to star as Steve Rogers/Captain America in the MCU. When Evans first appears onscreen, fans are meant to assume he's playing Cap, but then the big reveal comes when he shouts Johnny's signature line, \"Flame on!\"\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine encounter Johnny in The Void, and the trio is captured and brought to Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). Deadpool tells Cassandra that Johnny said a lot of nasty things about her, which prompts her to brutally murder the Fantastic Four member. Throughout the film, Wolverine blames Deadpool for Johnny's death. However, the end credits hilariously show that Deadpool was in the right.\n\nIn the final scene, Deadpool returns to the TVA so he can rewatch his encounter with Johnny, which features the character saying every nasty thing about Cassandra that Deadpool had said previously. Johnny even ends the speech with, \"You can quote me on that.\"\n\nThis scene may not be a tease for the future of the MCU, but it definitely felt like the proper way to end a Deadpool movie.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is now playing in theaters.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_jirak@comicbook.com", "name": "Jamie Jirak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Corrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Corrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Rise_of_the_Silver_Surfer_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/07/25/83465aaa-5e99-493f-a9eb-1dacf2ddc2d8/deadpool-wolverine-hugh-jackman-deadpool-3.png?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The MCU's first-ever R-rated movie hits theaters this Friday, bringing more mutants of the X-Men series into the MCU -- we first got to see mutants in the MCU in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the series Ms. Marvel. Ryan Reynolds is back as NSFW Deadpool and Hugh Jackman has put on a new, more comic-book accurate variant of his Wolverine suit after we all feared Logan would be the end for him playing the beloved, curmudgeon character.\n\nIt's certainly been awhile since we last saw either one of these men (and even longer since we first saw them together), so in case you need a refresher on the muddled chronological timeline of the MCU, the X-Men Universe and which movies you need to have seen prior to Wolverine & Deadpool, we've got you covered. Here's everything you need to know about Wolverine & Deadpool, including which characters make cameos in the new movie, if you need to stay for the post-credits scene and more.\n\nWolverine & Deadpool release date:\n\nThe official release date of Wolverine & Deadpool is Friday, July 26, 2024. But you should be able to catch an early showing as of today.\n\n\"I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn't want to presume that,\" Levy told AP. \"This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research.\"\n\nThat being said, if you do want a refresh on these two characters before jumping into the chaos of them teaming up, we've got you covered. Here's what you should watch before Deadpool & Wolverine to refamiliarize yourself with the dynamic duo.\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)\n\nIf you want Wolverine's origin story, you'll most likely want to watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine. The name pretty much says it all, plus you'll get an absolutely cursed first Deadpool sighting. You can catch Wolverine on Disney+ OR HBO's Max.\n\nDeadpool is back, this time with his very own movie. The first Deadpool film tells Wade Wilson's original story, from mercenary to mutant. Ryan Reynolds is in full Deadpool form for this one. You can also catch Deadpool on both Disney+ and Max.\n\nMore relevant Deadpool lore, lots of fun, probably some familiar faces returning for the new film. This one also stars Josh Brolin (not as Thanos though). You can stream Deadpool 2 on Disney+.\n\nIt sounds like Deadpool & Wolverine will be dealing with the Time Variance Authority (TVA), which is introduced to the MCU in the first season of Loki. Plus, the series was also the first to tackle the multiverse, particularly the episode \"Journey Into Mystery.\" Tom Hiddleston stars as Loki in Loki, which is currently streaming on Disney+.\n\nFor more of a multiverse crash course, consider revisiting Spider-Man: No Way Home. Thanks to a spell from Doctor Strange, things get a bit messy with the multiverse in the most-recent Spider-Man movie. No Way Home stars Tom Holland, Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch and some familiar faces from long ago in the franchise...\n\nIn short, we don't exactly know. It seems like while the MCU is finally bringing some X-Men characters into the canon, many of them will be dealing with The Void and a large part of the film's plot takes place at the TVA, which is located outside of space and time -- how convenient for new fans that aren't up to speed with the MCU timeline!\n\nWe do know that these variants of Deadpool and Wolverine will be entered into MCU canon with this film, meaning the characters could appear in future Marvel movies -- taking place in the present, future or even the past (probably).\n\nIn case you need the refresher, here's the entire MCU in chronological order, including movies, series and the One-Shots:\n\nAnd in case you want a crash course on Wolverine before seeing him team up with Deadpool, here's all of the Wolverine X-Men movies in order.\n\nIs there a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool & Wolverine? Well, of course. It wouldn't be the MCU without one. In fact, there's a post-credits scene and a credits scene that plays alongside the credits, making it much easier to stick around until the very end of the film.\n\nWhile there's no confirmed streaming date for Deadpool & Wolverine, based on Disney's patterns with streaming releases following theatrical runs, the movie will probably hit Disney+ around mid-October.", "source": {"uri":

Jackson blush.\n\nThe two previous Deadpool movies also had R ratings, so it's unsurprising this third installment does, too, even under Disney.\n\nThe company's CEO \"Bob Iger had said very early on that the other Deadpools were R, so this could be R,\" Marvel president Kevin Feige told Deadline Monday at the movie's premiere in New York. \"And we weren't going to undo any of the great work Ryan had done in those first movies.

If you missed them, that may explain why you're wondering if this one is OK for the little ones or even most teens. It really isn't. The movie may be fine for supervised older teens, though parents should be prepared for uncomfortable scenes and having to explain the explicit and mature topics.\n\nDisney owns the \"Deadpool\" franchise now, but that doesn't mean this sequel is suddenly gentler or family friendly. In just the first few minutes, there is blood everywhere and maybe three butt or penis jokes.\n\nMore: Holding out for a hero? Here are the 50 best, from Deadpool to Han Solo\n\nThe movie has scenes of brutal violence, drug abuse, casual suicidal ideation and many masturbation- and sex-related conversations.\n\nSo no, the movie is not appropriate for children, no matter how much your kids love Marvel movies or comic books or superheroes.

Of course, we are going to spoil them here for those who may not have understood the significance of those cameos (that is, if someone coaxed Amitabh Bachchan to watch Deadpool & Wolverine). So if you have not watched Deadpool & Wolverine yet and are planning to do so, please save yourself from SPOILERS and do not read ahead. Also, avoid the movie's Wikipedia page; the entire plot and the cameos are listed there as well. 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Movie Review: Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's Fan-Pleasing Antics Ain't Enough To Redeem Marvel Cinematic Universe!\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine brings Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, into the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the first time while also bringing back Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, aka Logan, from the dead, albeit as a different variant. This is the first MCU film led by X-Men characters after Disney bought out 20th Century Fox, which had the rights to X-Men and Fantastic Four. Some characters had already appeared in cameos in a couple of past MCU movies, such as Patrick Stewart's Professor X in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Kelsey Grammer's Beast in The Marvels.\n\nIn this feature, we will discuss all the fan-pleasing cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine. This will not include the cameos already spoiled by the trailers, such as Aaron Stanford's Pyro, Dafne Keen's X-23, Wunmi Mosaku's Hunter B-15, and others. 'Deadpool & Wolverine': From Dafne Keen's X-23 to Wunmi Mosaku's Hunter B-15, Major Cameos That Were Leaked by Trailers Before Marvel Movie's Release.\n\nHappy Hogan makes an appearance when Deadpool goes to Earth-616 to give an interview to join the Avengers back in 2018. His ribbing of Happy's promotion from being Tony Stark's chauffeur to managing Stark Enterprises and the Avengers Initiative, and that he has never been a team player (Deadpool 2's ending says otherwise), costs Deadpool a spot in the Avengers. Did he use Cable's time-travelling device to jump universes (Deadpool 2 is set in 2018 as well)? Considering the film later references the 2003 film Daredevil and even brings in Elektra, it is surprising Deadpool didn't make a joke about Favreau being in that movie.\n\nWhen Deadpool is brought to the TVA by Paradox, the latter shows Wade previous footage from Avengers movies, which includes the Avengers themselves, while enticing Wade to join the 'Sacred Timeline.' Among those clips, he accidentally shows a scene from the future where Deadpool is dying in Thor's arms. It is definitely a repurposed scene from Thor: The Dark World with Deadpool replacing Loki (who, of course, is only faking his death).\n\nWhile Deadpool goes Wolverine-hunting through various universes to find one to replace the dead one in his, he comes across various variants of Logan, most of whom are played by Jackman. In one universe, he lands right when Wolverine is about to fight the Hulk. Sadly for the fans, we only get a glimpse of the green giant and nothing of the fight. We don't even know which Bruce Banner it is - Bana, Norton, or Ruffalo. 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Fact Check: BLACKPINK's Jennie Kim, Emma Stone, Keanu Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger Cast As Deadpool Variants? Here's Truth About Viral 'Leaked' Cast Credits.\n\nAs mentioned before, we get to see quite a few Wolverine variants, most of whom are played by Jackman. But there is one badass Wolverine played by a completely different actor - Henry Cavill! Not only is Deadpool surprised, so are we! So if Hugh Jackman thinks of hanging up his Wolverine claws for good, we do have a nice replacement for him.\n\nIn what is the film's best cameo, Chris Evans returns to the MCU but to our and Deadpool's utter shock, he doesn't shout 'Avengers Assemble' when Wade and Logan meet him in the Void. Instead, he shouts 'Flame On!' and turns himself into a flaming ball of fire. Yes, the Evans we meet in Deadpool & Wolverine isn't our dear old Steve Rogers, but rather the first Marvel character he played - Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch, in Tim Story's Fantastic Four duology. His fire powers, however, don't work on Pyro, leading to an embarrassing defeat. This Storm variant meets a hilarious yet grisly end when the Void mutants take him, Deadpool, and Wolverine in captivity to Cassandra Nova. Deadpool tells her that Johnny had said some explicit and choice abuses for her, which the latter vehemently denies, thus earning Nova's punishment. While Deadpool gets blamed by Logan for being responsible for Johnny's death, he uses the post-credit scene to show he wasn't lying. Still, Deadpool, no one likes a snitch!\n\nJennifer Garner first played Elektra Natchios in the 2003 film Daredevil, where her ex-husband Ben Affleck played the main lead, and later she even got a spinoff, Elektra, which came out in 2005. Both films aren't among Marvel fans' favourite movies. Garner returns in Deadpool & Wolverine as an Elektra variant dumped in the Void, who is part of the rebel alliance fighting against Cassandra Nova called 'The Others', which has three other members...\n\n...One of which is the return of this daywalker. Snipes' inclusion is quite a surprise here for two reasons. One, he infamously didn't get along with Ryan Reynolds during the shoot of Blade: Trinity, something which the actors even playfully acknowledge in the film. Two, it was inferred he was not happy the MCU was rebooting Blade with Mahershala Ali in the lead (though that project has been delayed for quite some time). Again, Snipes' Blade takes a dig at this, saying he is the only one to play Blade till now, to which Deadpool looks at the camera and gives a knowing glance. Wonder if this joke will stale like sour milk when Marvel finally makes Blade with Ali.\n\nOnce upon a time, Fox had planned spinoffs of popular X-Men characters like Wolverine, Magneto, and Gambit, among others. However, only Wolverine managed to get three separate spinoffs for himself, not the rest (though Deadpool came out of nowhere in those plans thanks to Ryan Reynolds' persistent belief in the project). As for the Gambit spinoff, Channing Tatum, who was at the height of his popularity then thanks to Step Up, Magic Mike, and 21 Jump Street, was hired to play the lead. However, the project kept getting delayed and delayed before it was ultimately abandoned. Now, thanks to Deadpool & Wolverine, we finally get to see how Tatum's Gambit would have looked, and the character felt quite comic-accurate here, in his getup and the way he talks (much to Deadpool's annoyance). Gambit, Elektra, and Blade seemingly survived the attack at Cassandra Nova's 'Ant-Man' den, confirmed by the presence of X-23 (also part of 'The Others') in the final dinner table scene. So there is a possibility that we may see them in the future.\n\nPS: We already had a big screen portrayal of Gambit before in X-Men: Origins - Wolverine, though he was played by a different actor - Taylor Kitsch. Since that movie starred Reynolds and Jackman, and Deadpool movies love to riff on it, it is strange Deadpool didn't make a joke about the change in casting here.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine features not just multiple Wolverine variants but also many Deadpool ones too. The trailers had already shown us Dogpool and Lady Deadpool, but the reason she makes this list is because, even though she is never unmasked, her voice and later the end-credits confirm she is played by Reynolds' wife, and our 'Gossip Girl', Blake Lively. She is not the only family member of the actor to play a Deadpool variant - Kidpool is played by their daughter Inez, while Babypool is played by their infant fourth child, Olin. Ryan himself has a dual role, one of course as the Deadpool we know, and the other being this unmasked 'nice guy' Deadpool, who calls himself Nicepool and retains the actor's handsome features along with blonde long hair.\n\nReynolds and his family members aren't the only ones playing Deadpool variants. The third act sees them and many other Deadpool variants pouring out of a portal that connects the Void to Wade's universe with the intent of killing him and Logan. Two other Deadpool variants get talking lines - Headpool and Cowboy Deadpool. Headpool, who is basically just a floating zombified Deadpool skull, is voiced by Nathan Fillion, who loves to make crazy cameos in superhero movies, notably in Guardians of the Galaxy films and The Suicide Squad. As for Cowboy Deadpool...\n\n...that drawl in his voice is enough for his fans to recognise that Cowboy Deadpool is played by Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey. For others, the end-credits confirm this.\n\nApart from these Marvel characters, there are others who get referenced throughout the film but are never shown. Some of the prominent ones are Tony Stark/Iron Man, Charles Xavier/Professor X, Daredevil, The Punisher, Magneto, Doctor Strange, Reed Richards/Mr Fantastic, Spider-Man (quite slyly without breaking the copyright agreement with Sony), Batman (wonder why copyright is never an issue when Deadpool trolls DC characters), Loki, Hawkeye, Beast, Scott Summers/Cyclops, Jean Grey, among others.\n\nPS: Not a single reference or dig for Black Widow. Why is that so, Mr Reynolds, considering you even made a joke on Hugh Jackman's divorce?", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Beloved by millions, and a baffling structure of seemingly endless movies and assorted other media to millions more. We're used to seeing a Marvel movie every few months, but 2024 is the first year since 2012 (excluding 2020, in which cinemas were largely shut down) that we're getting just one new entry in the MCU's filmography. But it's a big one: Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nNow, any film in the MCU comes with baggage. Deadpool & Wolverine is part of the so-called Phase 5, and it's the 34th film in the MCU. The films' plots are notoriously complicated for the uninitiated, but the densely woven-in references and interconnecting story lines and characters are a vital part of the MCU's charm.\n\nThankfully, you don't need to watch all 33 other MCU films to understand what's going on in Deadpool & Wolverine. The characters of Deadpool and the X-Men were owned by 20th Century Fox, so the new film references more elements from Fox's pre-Disney-merger movies than the ones in the MCU. (To briefly recap: In the '90s, Marvel sold movie rights to its characters piecemeal in an attempt to inject some cash into its flailing comics business. Hence, we get a new Sony movie scraping the barrel of Spider-Man characters every few years.)\n\nThat's why Deadpool & Wolverine is such a big deal: It's the first time we're seeing major Marvel characters like Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in the MCU. If you haven't been keeping up with Marvel's Phase 5 and are wondering how you're supposed to understand what the heck is going on in Deadpool & Wolverine, have no fear. We've put together this syllabus so you know exactly what you need to watch before diving into the summer's biggest movie (that doesn't feature Minions or tornadoes).\n\nWhile Deadpool & Wolverine seems like an entirely new thing, as it is the franchise's first foray into the MCU proper, it's a threequel. The first Deadpool sets things in motion, providing a background into Wade Wilson (a.k.a. Deadpool), the loudmouthed, wisecracking mercenary with a heart of ... well, maybe not gold. These films are tonally distinct from the rest of the MCU, featuring a heavy dose of swearing, gore, self-referential humor, and consistent fourth-wall breaking.\n\nDeadpool 2 is particularly vital, as it introduces the time-travel element that plays a significant role in Deadpool & Wolverine as well as a few important characters that stick around in the new film. An important note: Don't skip the credits, as the mid-credits scene sets up an important detail about time traveling that remains a key part of Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\n\u27bc Logan (2017)\n\nNow it's time for Wolverine, a.k.a. James \"Logan\" Howlett. A major member of the X-Men, Logan has been through a hell of a lot over nine (not including cameos) different X-Men films. For our purposes, the most essential is Logan, which is heavily referenced throughout Deadpool & Wolverine, including clips from the film. It's also a key text for understanding Logan as we find him here: a weary, ultrapowerful mutant whose regenerating powers mean death is all but impossible. It's one of the standout superhero movies of recent memory. Director James Mangold keeps the focus on character while still allowing for some exceptionally gritty and memorable fight sequences.\n\nThe main plot in Deadpool & Wolverine homes in on the TVA, the Time Variance Authority. It's a bureaucracy that exists to preserve something called the \"sacred timeline\" and is also responsible for managing alternative timelines. It's a lot. There's a hearty amount of exposition in Deadpool & Wolverine to explain the purpose of the TVA, but if you want to get the intricacies of the organization and time-travel mechanics, your best bet is watching the Disney+ series Loki, which follows the titular trickster (Tom Hiddleston) as he works with the TVA to help fix the sacred timeline. And if you make time for just one episode, make it season one, episode five, \"Journey Into Mystery,\" which gets a specific shout-out for good reason.\n\n\u27bc X-Men (2000) & X2 (2003)\n\nThe Logan in Deadpool & Wolverine is haunted by his past with the X-Men, and if you don't know their whole deal, there's no better way to find out than by watching both X-Men and X2. The films are a brilliant introduction to a group of mutants cast out by society because they have superpowers, of which Wolverine is a member. While by no means essential to understanding Deadpool & Wolverine, the films help contextualize Wolverine, and both X-Men and X2 are brilliant, filled with great characterizations, potent political metaphors, and dynamite action sequences. If you're newer to the superhero movie, there are few better places to start. They're part of a trilogy, but X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) is a considerable step down in quality.\n\nIf you want to dive into Logan's history, you could also watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), but take it from someone who excitedly attended a midnight screening of the film back in '09 -- you're best off watching good X-Men movies!\n\nIf you've left Deadpool & Wolverine curious about the multiverse -- which is part of a fairly elaborate gag in the film -- then your best place to start is Doctor Strange. It serves as a useful and well-cast (Benedict Cumberbatch! Rachel McAdams! Tilda Swinton!) primer to the complicated and robust world of the multiverse. While it can be somewhat confounding, there are some striking and creative visual effects to get you onboard, and you'll practically be a master of all things multiverse when you're through.\n\n\u27bcTeen Titans Go! To the Movies (2018)\n\nIf you loved Deadpool & Wolverine and were especially impressed by its meta-humor, then Teen Titans Go! To the Movies is a perfect follow-up. It has absolutely nothing to do with the MCU and is actually part of rival DC. But the film is a giddy animated treat for the whole family (unlike D&W, which is the least appropriate MCU entry by a considerable distance). Released the same year as Deadpool 2, Teen Titans is funnier, bolder, and a better satire of superhero culture. It features plenty of the wink-wink, nudge-nudge humor that fuels the Deadpool franchise and ends with perhaps the single finest fourth-wall break you could imagine.\n\nFurther Viewing (Spoilers Version)\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine has a few cameos from other denizens of the extended Marvel canon that have been exiled from the MCU until now. The following movies are where you can learn more about these new old friends. Spoilers ahead, so stop reading if you want to go into Deadpool & Wolverine with a clean slate. You've been warned!

This article contains spoilers for Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nSummary Prepare for a multiversal adventure in Deadpool & Wolverine with various Wade Wilson variants and surprise heroes cameos. Dogpool and Nicepool join original Deadpool in the battle against multiversal threats, showcasing unique traits and humor. Peterpool emerges as an unlikely hero in the finale, uniting the Deadpool Corps and preventing a catastrophic conflict.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine features several variants of the former hero, from those versed in Marvel Comics lore to those created for the movie. As expected, Deadpool & Wolverine deals with the concept of the multiverse heavily. The appearance of Deadpool & Wolverine's Paradox involves the TVA in the duo's lives, leading to a multiversal adventure filled with cameos, surprise inclusions, and teases for the list of upcoming Marvel movies.\n\nAs was teased in the film's trailers, Deadpool & Wolverine would feature an increased dosage of the former. Despite being a movie that is split between Wade Wilson and Wolverine equally, variants of Deadpool were confirmed to appear in Deadpool & Wolverine's cast. Although the story includes variants of other major heroes, including Wolverine himself in some surprising cameos, Deadpool & Wolverine's ending delivers on its promise of including Wade Wilson variants in a fantastic action sequence that ranks among the MCU's best.\n\n15 Original Deadpool The Variant From The First Two Deadpool Movies Close\n\nNaturally, the most prominent variant of Deadpool to appear in Deadpool & Wolverine is the titular version. This version hails from Earth-10005, the official multiversal designation for Fox's X-Men movie timeline, and picks up from the ending of Deadpool 2. After establishing his usage of Cable's time machine, which even resulted in him traveling to Earth-616 in an attempt to join the Avengers, Deadpool & Wolverine shows Wade as a car salesman, officially retired from superhero work as Deadpool.\n\nWhen the TVA appears and informs Deadpool of a threat to his timeline, the hero springs back into action. Of course, this variant of Deadpool gets the most screentime as the lead of the film, from his adventure to find a variant of Logan who can help him to his battles in the Void against the forces of Cassandra Nova. By the time of the film's ending, Deadpool encounters several other versions of himself, some more friendly than others.\n\n14 Dogpool Mary Poppins Is Deadpool's Loyal Ally Close\n\nThe Deadpool variant with the second-most amount of screentime in Deadpool & Wolverine is arguably Dogpool, a.k.a. Mary Poppins. This character first appears in the Void as a companion of another Deadpool variant but takes a liking to the original Deadpool. Throughout the film, Dogpool often reappears as someone who wants to be around the titular duo of Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\nIn the final act, Dogpool appears alongside the rest of the Deadpool Corps. Dogpool races towards Deadpool and Wolverine before they can be attacked by the other variants, being hidden away before the ensuing fight. Dogpool is based on the same variant of the character from Marvel Comics, though as a much different type of dog.\n\n13 Nicepool The Nicest Variant Of Deadpool In Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nEarly in the production of Deadpool & Wolverine, set photos revealed an image of Ryan Reynolds filming as a long-haired variant of Deadpool. Many took to calling this variant a samurai version of Deadpool, but Deadpool & Wolverine dubs him Nicepool. This variant of the character is the initial owner of Dogpool and helps the original Deadpool and Wolverine on their adventure through the Void.\n\nLike Dogpool, Nicepool's arrival in the final act of Deadpool & Wolverine precedes the appearance of the Deadpool Corps. Unfortunately, Nicepool does not possess the same powers as other variants and cannot regenerate, leading him to a tragically hilarious death scene shortly after one of the film's best meta jokes. Nicepool's legacy lives on, however, when the original Deadpool takes up his weapons and avenges his death.\n\n12 Lady Deadpool The Female Leader Of The Deadpool Corps Close\n\nWhile the Deadpool Corps did not outwardly proclaim a leader, the variant who led them through the portal in the finale of Deadpool & Wolverine was Lady Deadpool. Lady Deadpool is another popular variant of the character from Marvel Comics and was teased in several of the film's trailers. The teases caused a great deal of speculation, with theories about who would play the female version of the character ranging from Ryan Reynolds in a wig to Taylor Swift.\n\nWhile the character was never unmasked, Lively provided the voice work for the character and was likely the one under the suit...\n\nAnother popular name raised for Lady Deadpool was Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds' wife. As it turns out, Lively portrayed Lady Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine. While the character was never unmasked, Lively provided the voice work for the character and was likely the one under the suit too. Lady Deadpool is slightly different from other variants in that she has two mini machine guns as her primary weapons rather than dual pistols.\n\n11 Kidpool The Young Version Of Deadpool Was Another Member Of The Corps\n\nKidpool is another Marvel Comics variant of the Deadpool Corps that was heavily theorized to appear in the film. Many assumed that Walker Scobell would portray this variant, given his prior work with director Shawn Levy in The Adam Project. In this film, Scobell played a younger version of Ryan Reynolds, leading many to believe he was perfect for the role of Kidpool.\n\nHowever, Scobell did not portray Kidpool in Deadpool & Wolverine. Instead, that honor went to Inez Reynolds, the daughter of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively. Kidpool, like Lady Deadpool, remained masked in the finale of the movie, instead being reduced to one line of dialogue. However, the dialogue was suitably laden with curse words and profanity, fitting the R-rated tone of the movie as another Deadpool variant.\n\n10 Headpool The Zombified Version Of Deadpool From Marvel Comics\n\nPerhaps the strangest variant of Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine is Headpool. In the comics, Headpool began as simply another Deadpool from an alternate Earth. However, this timeline was infected by a zombie outbreak, leading Wade to be bitten. The zombified version of Wade was transported to Earth-616 where his body was torn apart, leaving him a talking, zombie head resembling the Merc with a Mouth.\n\nFor the most part, this is exactly how Deadpool & Wolverine portrays Headpool too. Longtime MCU cameo actor Nathan Fillion voices Headpool in the film, who is seen flying out of a portal alongside the other variants of the character. While he was not much use in the ensuing battle between the Corps and Deadpool and Wolverine, the character's strange nature and iconic design leave an impression.\n\nRelated Marvel Zombies: Cast, New Zombies & Everything We Know\n\nContinuing from a popular episode of What If...?, Marvel Zombies reimagines the MCU as being overrun by a zombie plague. Here's what we know about it.\n\n9 Babypool The Youngest Deadpool Variant\n\nKidpool is a child version of Deadpool, but Deadpool & Wolverine takes this one step further. In the film, there is Babypool, which is exactly how it sounds. This variant of Wade Wilson is a baby, who naturally does not play a big part in the battle against Deadpool and Wolverine. Interestingly, another Reynolds brings Babypool to life, with Lively and Reynolds' fourth and most recent child, Olin Reynolds, portraying the variant.\n\n8 Cowboy Deadpool The Wild West Version Of Wade Wilson\n\nUndoubtedly one of the more recognizable variants of Deadpool present in Deadpool & Wolverine's final act is Cowboy Deadpool. The character, like Babypool, looks exactly as one would expect. The variant wears the classic Deadpool suit but with all the cowboy get-up, from the boots, spurs, hat, and belt buckle. The quickdraw weapons also separate Cowboy Deadpool from his brethren in the Deadpool Corps.\n\nMatthew McConaughey has often been fancast in a number of Marvel roles, including Norman Osborn in the MCU's upcoming Spider-Man 4 .\n\nConcerning who plays Cowboy Deadpool, the cameo is near perfect. In Deadpool & Wolverine, Matthew McConaughey finally makes his way into the Marvel Cinematic Universe by voicing the character. McConaughey's southern drawl is perfect for a wild west version of Deadpool, lending his iconic voice to the character as he attempts to take down Wolverine and the original Deadpool alongside his peers in the Corps.\n\nRelated Matthew McConaughey's Perfect Marvel Role Would Make Up For His 7-Year-Old MCU Rejection\n\nMatthew McConaughey once rejected a role in a fan-favorite MCU movie; however, the actor now has an even better Marvel character to play years later.\n\n7 Welshpool Ryan Reynolds' Wrexham Connections Bear Fruit In Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nBesides acting, Reynolds' biggest business venture in recent years has been his ownership of Welsh football club, Wrexham A.F.C. This ownership, alongside It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star Rob Mcelhenney, has been outlined in the Disney+ series Welcome to Wrexham. Naturally, many expected Deadpool's meta brand of humor to contain references to Wrexham A.F.C., with the Deadpool Corps proving this to be true.\n\nThe character looks the same as most other Deadpool variants, only with a giant Welsh flag painted across his chest...\n\nAmong the army of Deadpool variants in the finale of Deadpool & Wolverine is Welshpool. The character looks the same as most other Deadpool variants, only with a giant Welsh flag painted across his chest. In the film, Welshpool is portrayed by Wrexham player Paul Mullin, who has made over 100 appearances for Reynolds' club.\n\n6 Watari (Ronin-pool) The Samurai Variant Of Deadpool From Marvel Comics\n\nLike Cowboy Deadpool and Welshpool, Watari is one of the more recognizable Deadpool variants in Deadpool & Wolverine. This version of the character is distinguishable by his Eastern influence, wielding a samurai sword and dressed in a long, flowing robe. Similarly, Watari wears a large ronin hat, capping off the Japanese influence of the variant.\n\nWatari is actually a variant of Deadpool in Marvel Comics. While brief, Watari's appearance in the comics comes as he is shown saving several members of the Deadpool Corps from various threats. However, Watari is killed alongside many other members of the team by the Evil Deadpool Corps. In Deadpool & Wolverine, Watari fights against the titular duo and lives to fight another day along with the rest of his self-healing companions.\n\n5 Deadpool 2099 The Futuristic Variant Of Wade Wilson\n\nAnother of the Deadpool variants in Deadpool & Wolverine that stands out among the crowd is Deadpool 2099. This character is showcased as a futuristic version of Wade Wilson, complete with a very highly advanced suit of armor that has neon lights running throughout. Rather than wield swords like the other Deadpool variants, Deadpool 2099 has lightsaber-like sticks of energy that they use to fight against Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\nIn Marvel Comics, Deadpool 2099 has her own run. The character is known as Warda Wilson and is the daughter of Wade and Shiklah, the queen of the underworld. The character first appeared in 2016, making her one of the more recent variants of Deadpool to appear as part of the Corps in Deadpool & Wolverine's explosive final act.\n\n4 Golden Age Deadpool One Of The Founding Deadpool Corps Members\n\nIn Marvel Comics, there are four characters who appear to Deadpool and tell him of the Corps. One of these is Golden Age Deadpool, alongside Lady Deadpool, Dogpool, and Kidpool. Golden Age Deadpool is exactly what his name suggests, a variant of the character from the Golden Age of comic book heroes.\n\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine, the comic book design of Golden Age Deadpool has been translated well. Rather than the spandex suit worn by most Deadpool variants, Golden Age Deadpool wears more old-timey clothes, complete with a gasmask and a pair of cutlasses, as opposed to Deadpool's usual katanas. In the fight, he is defeated by Deadpool and Wolverine before recovering.\n\n3 Zenpool A More Pacifistic Version Of Deadpool Close\n\nIn Marvel Comics, Zenpool forms from the backlash of a spell cast by Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom. During a battle against an army called the Red Onslaught, Scarlet Witch and Doom attempted to alter the Onslaught's brain, inadvertently affecting their allies, including Deadpool. As such, Deadpool became Zenpool, a pacifistic version of his former self.\n\nEventually, Zenpool reverts back to his usual self as the smart-mouthed, violent Deadpool.\n\nZenpool wears a white Deadpool mask with a grey hood and a large wooden stick as his weapon. In Deadpool & Wolverine, one of the Deadpool variants that receives a close-up is Zenpool. The film showcases his white mask and the wooden stick weapon before the Corps rushes to meet Deadpool and Wolverine in battle.\n\n2 Peterpool Arguably The Most Important Deadpool Variant\n\nAfter the battle rages between Wolverine, Deadpool, and the Deadpool Corps, the self-healing nature of the latter threatens to result in another conflict. However, an unlikely hero saves the day: Peterpool. Using the Deadpool costume hung in his work locker, Peter - the close friend of the original Deadpool - dons the suit and rushes into the fray.\n\nPeter arguably saves the Marvel multiverse as, without him, Deadpool & Wolverine 's villain would not have been stopped in time...\n\nThe other Deadpools begin lauding Peter, lifting him above them and rushing off to celebrate his arrival. As it turns out, every Deadpool has a Peter, and he is someone who they are all clearly lucky to have. Peterpool's appearance calms tempers, preventing another fight from occurring. In doing so, Peter arguably saves the Marvel multiverse as, without him, Deadpool & Wolverine's villain would not have been stopped in time by the titular heroic duo.\n\n1 The Deadpool Corps The Remainder Of The Deadpool Variants\n\nOutside of the recognizable Deadpool variants mentioned, Deadpool & Wolverine simply had hundreds of other versions of the character. Without the defining traits of samurai hats, cowboy hats, gray hoods, or youth, the many other Deadpool variants were other people in seemingly identical suits. These Deadpool variants were used to fill out the numbers for the final battle in Deadpool & Wolverine, as the Deadpool variants came up against the titular mutants in an MCU action scene for the ages.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine R\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth.

The mid-credits scene pays tribute to Fox-era Marvel films. The post-credits scene reveals an extended conversation involving Chris Evans as The Human Torch.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine officially bring the Merc with a Mouth and his angry-clawed friend to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a big way. As always, no trip to the MCU would be complete without a time-honored tradition - the end-credits scene. Believe it or not, Deadpool & Wolverine only features one scene, though there is a welcome surprise midway through that we'll certainly call attention to.\n\nMarvel Studios' first-ever R-rated feature film sees Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) form an uneasy alliance to save Deadpool's universe, which is dangerously close to being destroyed by a rogue cell of the Time Variance Authority. During their travels, they encounter an army of X-Men villains led by Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), a quartet of fan-favorite cameos, a veritable legion of psychotic Deadpool variants, and much more. They succeed in their multiverse saving quest, but a Marvel movie isn't truly over until the credits are finished rolling. While the de facto end-credits sequence of Deadpool & Wolverine doesn't directly set up what may be next for Wade Wilson and Logan Howlett, it does feature another brilliant callback to one of the movie's best cameo appearances.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\n810\n\nSuperhero\n\nAction\n\nComedy\n\nSci-Fi\n\nWolverine joins the \"merc with a mouth\" in the third installment of the Deadpool film franchise.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2024\n\nDirector Shawn Levy\n\nThe Mid-Credits Sizzle Reel of 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Pays Tribute to the Fox-Era of Marvel\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine moves into its end credits rather quickly, and as they roll, a charming sizzle reel is playing along the side. It begins with clips and behind-the-scenes footage of the original X-Men film from the year 2000. We see some classic stars from the film that started it all, including a young and enthusiastic Hugh Jackman (who, to be honest, has not aged a single day since the year 2000). The footage then quickly goes on to include the many other entries in the long-running X-Men series, such as X-Men Origins: Wolverine, X-Men: First Class, and many more.\n\nThat being said, it's not just the X-Men series that gets a welcome tribute. Some of 20th Century Studios' other Marvel adaptations also get some love, and it's nice to see Marvel Studios paying some thanks to the films that honestly inspired the MCU. Among the X-Men clips are several sequences from the original Daredevil film from 2003, paying off the thrilling Elektra (Jennifer Garner) cameo from earlier in the movie. Also recognized are all three of the 20th Century's Fantastic Four films, both the two originals and the contentious remake. Speaking of The Fantastic Four...\n\nChris Evans Brings the Heat as The Human Torch in 'Deadpool & Wolverine'\n\nClose\n\nLong before he donned the star-spangled stripes and the iconic adamantium shield, Chris Evans portrayed the cocky hothead Johnny Storm in 2005's Fantastic Four and 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. After the events of Avengers: Endgame, it seemed that Evans' journey in the MCU had finally concluded after putting Captain America to rest. Oh, how wrong we were, as Chris Evans does indeed return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Deadpool & Wolverine, but not in the way that you (and Deadpool himself) think.\n\nAfter Deadpool and Wolverine finish up their quick fight in front of the 20th Century Fox logo, they're greeted by a hooded figure before Cassandra Nova's goons surround them. That figure is none other than a character played by Chris Evans, and Deadpool understandably assumes this is a variant of Captain America. However, as soon as the character yells \"flame on\", it's abundantly clear who he really is - a variant of Johnny Storm, AKA The Human Torch. Storm tries to help the duo, but he's powerless against Pyro's (Aaron Stanford) pyrokinetic abilities.\n\nDeadpool, Wolverine, and The Human Torch are taken to Cassandra Nova's base, which is the decayed corpse of an Ant-Man variant. Deadpool, ever the talker, begins trying to cover his ass by accusing Torch of talking an endless amount of smack about Cassandra Nova, which Johnny Storm quickly tries to shut down. It's all to no avail, as Nova rapidly murders The Human Torch in perhaps the most brutal and horrifying death of the film - getting his own skin ripped off from his own body, then collapsing in a pile of bones and blood. Deadpool is understandably blamed by Wolverine and the rest of the resistance fighters for The Human Torch's death, but we don't get the full story behind Johnny's comments until the post-credits scene.\n\nDeadpool Sets the Record Straight in the Post-Credits Scene of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'\n\nThe post-credits scene of Deadpool & Wolverine sees Wade Wilson set the record straight on what Johnny Storm actually said about Cassandra Nova. Somehow sneaking back into the TVA's offices just to prove a point, Deadpool shows an extended version of the ride Deadpool and Wolverine shared with The Human Torch. Suffice it to say, while Deadpool may still be directly responsible for Johnny Storm's brutal death, he was telling the truth about what Johnny Storm said.\n\nThe extended sequence in the prison car sees Chris Evans channel his inner Bostonian to deliver a truly hysterical rant about Cassandra Nova. Every profane and graphic detail that Deadpool would repeat later is stated and then some. He even directly foreshadows the means and method behind his impending death, and Deadpool is enjoying every minute of the rant. While his portrayal of Captain America always kept things PG, Chris Evans' R-rated rant about the MCU's terrifying new villain gives the beloved actor a true chance to unleash his creative insults. That alone is worth staying till the very end of the credits for Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is now in theaters.

I am actually not joking.

But in 2017, Jackman announced he was stepping down from playing the character.\n\n\"Logan,\" Jackman's last appearance as Wolverine, ended with the character dying after his super-healing ability stopped working, but the gamble paid off. The film was a commercial hit, beloved by critics and fans alike, and was nominated for a best adapted screenplay Oscar.\n\nJackman told Fandango in May that seeing the first \"Deadpool\" movie changed his mind about retiring the Wolverine mantle.\n\n\"I was like, 'Those two characters together,'\" Jackman said. \"I knew the fans wanted it ever since I put on the claws, people talked about these two. So, that had always been there, but I just knew.\"\n\nBut don't worry, Wolverine fans. \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" finds a way to bring the character back into the action while still honoring his legacy.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) breaks the fourth wall to ask the question everyone has on their minds -- how can this movie bring back Jackman as Wolverine \"without disrespecting Logan's memory\"?\n\nDeadpool says, \"We're not,\" and then proceeds to unceremoniously dig up Wolverine's grave from \"Logan.\"\n\nA flashback after the opening sequence explains why.\n\nMr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), a member of the MCU's time-police organization called TVA, brings Deadpool in and tells him that his timeline is slowly dying because it lost its anchor person: Wolverine.\n\nParadox plans to speed up the process with a machine he's building called the time-ripper that will instantly cull Deadpool's timeline. He offers Deadpool the chance to hop over to the Sacred Timeline, but wanting to save his friends and family, Deadpool opts to stay and try to salvage their universe.\n\nBelieving that Wolverine can't actually die due to the regenerative abilities they both have, Deadpool first attempts to dig up Logan's body. But all he finds is the character's adamantium skeleton, confirming this universe's Wolverine is very much dead.\n\nAfter Deadpool unearths Wolverine's remains, a group of Paradox's TVA officers arrive to capture him. He mercilessly murders the officers one by one using Wolverine's adamantium-covered bones as weapons while dancing to NSYNC's song \"Bye Bye Bye.\"\n\nOnce they're all dead, he moves on to plan B.\n\nAfter confirming that his universe's Logan really is dead, Deadpool's next move is to search the multiverse for a different Wolverine variant to take the dead one's place. He finds multiple versions (even one played by Henry Cavill, called the Cavillrine) before coming upon one who's brooding at a bar.\n\nDeadpool brings this Wolverine to the TVA, but Mr. Paradox reveals that the plan won't work because this is the worst Wolverine.\n\nThe movie later explains that this particular Wolverine didn't want to be part of the X-Men and went off drinking. While he was out, humans murdered the X-Men and other mutants. Wolverine blamed himself for this and started killing those guilty of the attack and other innocent people.\n\nIn the movie, Wolverine explains that he wears his yellow and blue X-Men suit to remind himself of what happened and to express his shame. Deadpool's journey gives this worst Wolverine a second chance at being a hero and saving the universe.\n\nUltimately, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is not about Jackman's triumphant return as the beloved hero we all knew. Instead, by bringing Jackman in as a \"new\" version of Wolverine, the film positions its lead characters as two underdogs trying their best to save the day and live up to a high bar of expectations.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandango_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandango Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(geology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mantle (geology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Macfadyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Macfadyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adamantium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cavill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Hugh-Jackman-makes-a-triumphant-return-in-'Deadpool-Wolverine.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Though Deadpool & Wolverine is the first film of Ryan Reynolds' superhero franchise to be part of the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe, the series is no stranger to post-credits scenes. The first movie teased the arrival of Cable in its credits scene, and the second movie's scene saw Reynolds' Merc with a Mouth cleaning up the timeline.\n\nNow, Deadpool returns in a multiverse adventure that finally features the long-awaited team-up with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, though it's a different version of Logan than the one that appeared in Fox's X-Men movie series. While the Deadpool & Wolverine ending seemingly wraps up the storyline well, there's more fun and nostalgia to be had during the credits. Here are the Deadpool & Wolverine credits scenes explained in full.\n\nRelated\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Review: The MCU Multiverse Movie I've Been Waiting For\n\nLed by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman at the top of their superhero game, Deadpool & Wolverine is an absurd blast of a Marvel multiverse joyride.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Mid-Credits Scene Explained: Every Marvel Movie Referenced\n\nThe BTS Montage Is A Heartwarming Look Back At Non-MCU Marvel Movies\n\nClose\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine doesn't feature a typical mid-credits scene, but instead opts to include a montage of behind-the-scenes footage from older Marvel movies. Amid shots of Jennifer Garner's Elektra and Chris Evans' Human Torch, there are interviews with Jackman talking about his early days of filming the first X-Men movie. There's also a clip of Reynolds discussing his love for the character of Deadpool while on the set of Blade: Trinity. The montage includes footage from a wide array of non-MCU Marvel movies that released before and after Marvel Studios launched their juggernaut franchise.\n\nEvery X-Men, Fantastic Four & Other Marvel Movie To Appear\n\nSince Deadpool & Wolverine acts as a kind of swan song for the Fox Marvel movies, there are a lot of films referenced in the credits' montage footage. While it's difficult to discern exactly what movie each clip in the montage comes from, here are all the major ones referenced:\n\nOriginal X-Men trilogy (X-Men, X2: X-Men United, X-Men: The Last Stand) New X-Men series (X-Men: First Class, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix) Wolverine trilogy (X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, Logan) Fantastic Four (2005), Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer Fantastic Four (2015) Daredevil, Elektra Blade: Trinity\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Mid-Credits Scene Song Explained\n\nThe song that plays during the Deadpool & Wolverine mid-credits scene is \"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\" by Green Day. The song was released in December 1997, but was so popular, it became an enduring part of American culture throughout the early 2000s. Although Green Day lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong wrote the song about an ex-girlfriend, it has since become more synonymous with nostalgia and reflecting on the past. For this reason, it was played at many proms and graduations across the world during the 90s and 00s.\n\nThe legacy of \"Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)\" as a nostalgic and reflective song, as well as the time at which it was released, makes it a perfect fit for the Marvel movie BTS montage. Not only does the song fit the tone, but it'll be familiar and tug at the heartstrings of any viewers who grew up watching the movies referenced. Altogether, the montage works as a farewell to the Fox Marvel franchise, essentially wiping the slate clean for what Marvel Studios has planned for the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Blade in the MCU.\n\nRelated\n\nEvery Upcoming Marvel Movie: Full MCU Phase 5 & 6 List (& Beyond)\n\nBetween Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures Entertainment, here is every upcoming Marvel movie release date and what we know about the projects so far.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Post-Credits Scene Explained: Language!\n\nDeadpool Uses TVA Technology To Set The Record Straight\n\nEarlier in Deadpool & Wolverine, when the heroes first wake up in the Void, they come across Chris Evans playing a Marvel character - who turns out to be Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch, from Fox's 2000s Fantastic Four movies. However, when the three are confronted by Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), Deadpool tells her a long litany of insults Johnny apparently said about her behind her back. Cassandra proceeds to tear the skin off Johnny's body, leaving him to collapse in a heap of bones and organs.\n\nFantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer are available to stream on Disney+.\n\nThroughout the rest of the movie, Wolverine blames Deadpool for Johnny's death, and it's implied Wade made up all those insults. However, in the Deadpool & Wolverine post-credits scene, Deadpool is in the TVA, and he uses their monitors to roll tape that shows Johnny Storm spouting a bunch of foul-mouthed insults about Cassandra Nova on the way to her headquarters. So, it's not that Deadpool made up the insults that got Johnny killed, it's just that he told Cassandra exactly what Human Torch said - which still got him killed.\n\nAlthough the scene is ostensibly meant to clear Deadpool of the accusations hurled at him by Wolverine throughout the movie, it really just confirms that he wasn't putting words in Johnny's mouth. Deadpool still very much got Johnny Storm killed by telling Cassandra Nova what he said. There was no real reason for him to do it, because it didn't even really help him or Wolverine escape the villain. Still, the scene has a deeper, more fun meaning for MCU viewers.\n\nChris Evans Swearing Calls Back To Avengers: Age Of Ultron\n\nIn Avengers: Age of Ultron, the team is on a mission when Iron Man swears over the comms. In response, Chris Evans' Captain America scolds him with a single word: \"Language.\" That one line has since taken on a life of its own among fans, who enjoy quoting it not just to each other, but Evans himself. It's MCU canon that Evans' Marvel superhero doesn't swear - so seeing the actor's other character saying the most vile things is a perfect callback. It sets Johnny Storm apart from Steve Rogers, and makes excellent use of Deadpool & Wolverine's R rating.\n\nCan Chris Evans Return As Human Torch Despite His Death?\n\nIt isn't confirmed that the variant of the Human Torch killed in Deadpool & Wolverine is the exact same as the version from Fox's Fantastic Four movies. The costume he wears is different, as is the Fantastic Four logo, so it's possible he's a variant from another universe. The MCU has established that the same actor can play multiple variants in addition to multiple actors playing variants of the same character. All that's to say, there could still be another version of Johnny Storm that Evans could play in the future, even as the MCU introduces their new Fantastic Four.\n\nRelated\n\nMCU Fantastic Four Cast Revealed As Marvel Changes Release Date & Title Of Phase 6 Movie\n\nMarvel Studios confirms the Fantastic Four movie cast, who will star in the MCU Phase 6 film set to release on July 25, 2025.\n\nMarvel Movie Credits Surprise: No MCU Character Teased To Return\n\nDeadpool And Wolverine Could Still Return In A Future MCU Movie\n\nClose\n\nIn the early days of the MCU and more recently in Phases 4 and 5, Marvel Studios movies have included a final text screen that teases the return of one of the characters. For example, Thor: Love & Thunder teased \"Thor will return,\"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness teased \"Doctor Strange will return,\" and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 teased \"Star-Lord will return.\" However, Deadpool & Wolverine didn't confirm Deadpool or Wolverine's return in the MCU. That's not necessarily confirmation they won't - The Marvels also didn't tease a specific character's return - it just hasn't been teased.\n\nBoth Deadpool and Wolverine are alive at the end of the movie, so it's possible they can return in another MCU movie, with the most likely being Avengers 5 and/or Avengers: Secret Wars. Both movies are expected to deal with the multiverse, and cap off the MCU's Multiverse Saga in an exciting fashion. If that's the case, Deadpool and Wolverine could easily return. Ultimately, Deadpool & Wolverine leaves its titular heroes' futures open-ended, so even though their returns aren't confirmed, they could still happen.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nR\n\nAction\n\nSci-Fi\n\nComedy\n\nSuperhero\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth.

Just How R Rated Is It?", "body": "Summary\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine marks the first R-rated movie for the MCU, with plenty of blood, violence, and cursing to match its antihero characters. The movie maintains Deadpool's signature mature themes, not shying away from gore or profanity, challenging the typical family-friendly MCU mold. While the movie includes sexual references, it stops short of explicit scenes, making it marginally more family-friendly compared to previous Deadpool installments, although it is still far from being a kid-friendly release.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine has hit theaters, and while it may be the first R-rated movie for the MCU, there are naturally questions surrounding how much it warrants this rating. Deadpool & Wolverine has finally brought the Merc with a Mouth to the MCU alongside his dream companion, Wolverine. The early days of Disney's acquisition of Fox led to much speculation over whether the famously family-friendly franchise would tone down Deadpool's no-holds-barred content to fit within the typical ethos of Disney and the MCU timeline.\n\nConsidering Deadpool's legacy both on the page and on the big screen as one of Marvel's most hyper-violent and unabashed antiheroes, fears were thankfully assuaged relatively quickly. While Deadpool & Wolverine's R-rating may have raised concerns that a large swathe of the MCU fandom may be precluded from taking part in Marvel's next big movie, the question remains over whether the release is truly as exclusive as the official age rating would suggest. As such, here is a spoiler-free rundown of what audiences can expect to make their minds up on the matter.\n\nRelated\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Review: The MCU Multiverse Movie I've Been Waiting For\n\nLed by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman at the top of their superhero game, Deadpool & Wolverine is an absurd blast of a Marvel multiverse joyride.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Is The MCU's First R-Rated Movie\n\nMCU Movies Are Typically PG-13\n\nClose\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America has given Deadpool & Wolverine a \"Restricted\" rating. This comes with the following descriptor:\n\nContains some adult material. Parents are urged to learn more about the film before taking their young children with them.\n\nThis rating mirrors the two previous Deadpool movies and indicates the severity of Deadpool & Wolverine's adult themes. It is also the first time that the rating has made its way to the MCU's movie roster, though Marvel TV productions like Daredevil and Punisher boast the equivalent TV-MA rating.\n\nThe UK equivalent of an R-rating assigned by the British Board of Film Classification is 15, which helps to give an indication of the kind of age range considered suitable for R-rated productions.\n\nThis is a significant development for the MCU as its movies have all been PG-13 until now. While some MCU movies are more violent than others, nearly all shy away from showing more than a drop of (human) blood, replacing it instead with either alien blood or fluid used to power robots. The latter was used to great effect in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, as Scarlet Witch is depicted covered in a blood-like substance that came from destroying numerous Ultrons. Deadpool & Wolverine, however, is unapologetically bloody.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Is Very Bloody & Violent\n\nClose\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine telegraphed the level of blood, gore, and violence that audiences could expect when the first trailers were released. As the titular heroes tussle, trailers show Wolverine stabbing Deadpool through the groin and Deadpool firing at point-blank range through Wolverine's abdomen. To put it mildly, there is plenty more where that came from in the movie itself, as the MCU takes full advantage of the R-rating and the titular characters' MO. The hack-and-slash violence they engage in is one thing, but their dual healing factors also ensure that they can continue shedding blood and limbs ad infinitum.\n\nMarvel Comics suggests that Deadpool's healing factor is more powerful than Wolverine's, which is hinted at in the X-Men movies by the fact that Wolverine could die in Logan .\n\nThis should come as no surprise to anyone who has watched Deadpool and Deadpool 2. Some hyper-violent highlights from these movies include Deadpool's single-bullet triple headshot in Deadpool and Juggernaut tearing Deadpool in two with his bare hands in Deadpool 2. Deadpool & Wolverine treads much of the same gory ground while finding yet more creative ways of inflicting grievous injury. The violence is the most overt justification for the movie's R-rating and may be the most prudent concern for parents wondering whether it is family-friendly.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best Deadpool Movie Scenes, Ranked\n\nDeadpool is a staple of the superhero genre thanks to his unique humor, quirks, and the action he brings to his movies, with outstanding scenes.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Includes A Lot Of Cursing\n\nClose\n\nA PG-13 rating comes with a rule that one utterance of harsh profanity - described as \"sexually-derived\" - is allowed. While this is the typical rating for all MCU movies, the MCU's first f-bomb didn't appear until 2023's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3. Deadpool & Wolverine has therefore increased the MCU's f-bomb tally one-hundredfold, as the Merc with a Mouth continues to live up to his nickname. His foul language is bolstered by characters like Wolverine, who also delivered X-Men: First Class' curse word allocation in 2011.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is arguably the MCU movie that put the most strain on its PG-13 rating, as it also featured moments of relatively shocking violence and gore.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine's R-rating means there is no upper limit on the amount or nature of curse words that characters can deploy. While this means that f-bombs rack up to the point where they almost become trivial, it never feels overly gratuitous, and audiences can expect to hear the same level and intensity of profanity featured in both Deadpool and Deadpool 2. With that in mind, Deadpool & Wolverine is on a par with its predecessors in most adult-themed areas - though it does rein in one R-rated factor.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Includes Some Sexual References\n\nLike the violence and profanity, the first Deadpool & Wolverine trailer laid out that sexual references would also be present in the movie as Wade Wilson jokes about pegging. While this is not the only sexual reference in the movie, the remainder follow a similar vein and are always part of a joke that - like most others in the movie - is swiftly brushed aside. The notable difference between this and Deadpool is that Deadpool & Wolverine stops at references and innuendos rather than depict actual sex scenes that feature the aforementioned activity.\n\nTaken together, Deadpool & Wolverine could be considered marginally more family-friendly than previous Deadpool installments, though it is still far from toned down. It is worth noting that it earns its R-rating and is worlds apart from the movies that typically comprise the MCU regarding mature themes and imagery. With that in mind, parents may wish to approach this movie with caution, basing the decision on the example set by Deadpool and Deadpool 2.\n\nIt is likely, meanwhile, that Marvel will somehow cater to the audiences that missed this installment and its implications on the wider MCU narrative in some other way. Once Upon a Deadpool was Fox's way of affording younger audiences the chance to catch up on the story in a more PG-friendly context. Whether Marvel does this with Deadpool & Wolverine in some capacity remains to be seen, but it is safe to say that this particular release is not one of Marvel's kid-friendly movies in its current state.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nR\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth.

Deadpool & Wolverine blends the multiverse with triumphant action and hilarity, whilst also acknowledging the faults of Fox and Disney Marvel movies with a sprinkle of easter eggs.\n\nRelated\n\n6 Most Polarizing Marvel Movies You Either Love Or Hate\n\nNot every Marvel movie can be a smashing success, and some of them have entered a realm of infinite discourse among fans.\n\nEvery Marvel movie has an abundance of easter eggs, and Deadpool & Wolverine is no exception to the rule, providing fans with some exciting eye-popping finds, with more soon to be discovered as more people head to the theaters to check the latest MCU movie out.\n\nSpoilers ahead for Deadpool & Wolverine!\n\n8 A New Wolverine\n\nHenry Cavill Becomes The Cavillerine\n\nWhen Wade Wilson goes multiverse-hopping, he cues a montage of Wolverine discoveries. Whilst most are played by Hugh Jackman, there are a few notable standouts. Deadpool meets Wolverine's Patch persona, a comic-accurate 5'3\" Wolverine, a crucified Wolverine from Uncanny X-Men #251, and even the classic John Byrne Wolverine donning a yellow and brown suit about to fight the Hulk.\n\nYet, there is one Wolverine that stands out above the rest: a new face for a familiar role. For the first time in 24 years, a new actor plays Wolverine, and Henry Cavill is revealed in a brilliant cameo and a sly dig at DC's treatment of their former Superman. It's brief, but extremely cool, especially when he reloads his arms like Mission Impossible: Fallout.\n\n7 Earth-616\n\nThe Official Name Of The MCU Is The Official Name Of The Comics\n\nThe beginning of Deadpool & Wolverine features Wade taking a quick little trip to the Sacred Timeline, which is titled in the film Earth-616. This is an important title to hold, as Earth-616 is the main timeline in the comics, acting as the canon universe that everything follows. Yet, for the MCU, this might be a tad controversial, as it negates the importance of the comic version of 616.\n\nIf Deadpool & Wolverine's MCU timeline is 616, then it implies that the comic version doesn't exist in the multiverse, and that the canon between the two same universes is fractured and not entirely comic-accurate. Regardless, it's nice to see the 616 label drop in.\n\n6 The Deadpool Corps\n\nMultiverse Deadpool Variants Form A Merc Corps\n\nThe Deadpool Corps is an annoying and infinite bunch of mercenaries who all don the red suit, providing the multiverse with alternate-reality Deadpool variants. Considering how intentionally annoying Deadpool is, it's no surprise that the Void is filled with them. From Dogpool, Kidpool, Nicepool, Headpool, to Lady Deadpool. All of them feature, but not all of them have something to do.\n\nRelated\n\nMarvel: Best Deadpool Runs In The Comics\n\nDeadpool has been ravishing the Marvel Universe for decades, and with that, comes a few great comic runs from famed writers and artists.\n\nIt's fun to see the multiverse variants of Deadpool, even if it is one that is celebrated through blood, limbs, and guts. Fans of the comics might recognize a few familiar variants, especially with the once-prominent member of the Deadpool line, Lady Deadpool.\n\n5 Rest in Peace Daredevil\n\nDaredevil, Magneto, And The Punisher Did Not Survive The Void\n\nWhen Deadpool and Wolverine are discovered by heroic survivors of the Void and Cassandra Nova's attempt to enslave them, they are informed of other heroes who tragically lost their lives. Names like Magneto, Professor X, and the Punisher were all mentioned as dead, but the most striking is that of Daredevil, who would have once been played by the DCEU's Batman, Ben Affleck.\n\nIt's a sly joke at the expense of Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck's former marriage, and it shows how brutal the Deadpool movies can be. Nevertheless, it's a shame that Ben Affleck was unable to cameo as Daredevil considering the familiar faces already present.\n\n4 An Ode To 20th Century Fox\n\nMeta Jokes And Commentary Are Made About Deadpool's Former IP Handlers\n\nOnce dropped into the Void, Deadpool and Wolverine battle each other with the discarded logo of 20th Century Fox behind them in the dirt. It's a funny set dressing, but it is also a harsh reminder and metaphor for the disappearance and buried nature of 20th Century Fox's legacy going forward, as Disney now owns the company, which includes the iconic characters seen on-screen from the X-Men and Fantastic Four movies.\n\nSeeing 20th Century Fox's logo in the dirt is a hilarious commentary on how the studio has been renamed away from Fox and is instead now 20th Century Studios. It's also a fun statement on how fans are happy to see the Fox-verse of Marvel movies dead and buried in the Void for the MCU's chance to depict the characters.\n\n3 A Cowl 20 Years In The Making\n\nHugh Jackman Finally Wears The Wolverine Cowl\n\nTowards the end of the movie, fans might be happy to finally see Hugh Jackman without the black leather and instead with a comic-accurate yellow costume for Wolverine, but something is notably missing. Despite the handsome nature of Hugh Jackman, it's just not the same without a sharp cowl and white lenses. Luckily when it's time to get dirty and fight the Deadpool Corps, Hugh Jackman wears the iconic cowl.\n\nIt's the first time the one and only live-action Wolverine has worn the iconic cowl, and it only took 24 years to get to this point where it's okay to be comic-accurate. Seeing the cowl in live-action is shockingly cool, and an easter egg that fans have waited for ever since they saw the black leather in the 2000's X-Men movie.\n\n2 Classic Cameos\n\nThe Marvel Universe Expands Past The MCU\n\nFans going into Deadpool & Wolverine already know that they will be treated to an abundance of cameos thanks to the trailers, but there are definitely going to be more surprises that they do not expect. The addition of Wesley Snipes' Blade and even Chris Evans' Human Torch is at a grand scale of excitement for veterans of the Marvel Universe.\n\nRelated\n\nAll 21 Cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine features an abundance of cameos from across the Marvel Universe, and beyond.\n\nThere are many surprise cameos in store for Deadpool & Wolverine. Blade and the Human Torch are just the tip of the iceberg, but rest assured, these cameos serve the plot well and are not just thrown in for a quick opportunity to get a cheer.\n\n1 The Fantasti-Car\n\nThe Fantastic Four's Iconic Vehicle Roams The Void\n\nRiding across the Void, fans might spot a familiar futuristic-looking vehicle with the number 4 adorned on the hood. This floating ride is none other than the Fantasti-Car, built by Reed Richards to hold the Fantastic Four as they journey across the world for their wonderful adventures to save it.\n\nThe Fantasti-Car doesn't get much attention, but it's definitely noticeable for fans who know what to look for, and further confirms that variants of the Fantastic Four have been to the Void, but whether or not they share the same fate as Johnny Storm is unknown.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2024\n\nDirector Shawn Levy\n\nCast Ryan Reynolds , Hugh Jackman , Emma Corrin , Morena

It's an excuse to get Ryan Reynolds' and Hugh Jackman's burgeoning bromance on the big screen for two hours and change. Go in expecting the usual tirade of dick jokes, excellent chemistry between the leads, and visually stunning choreography, and Deadpool & Wolverine won't disappoint.\n\nThat's not to say the film doesn't have a personality beyond the usual Deadpool gimmicks we've become so familiar with in his last two solo outings. Mixed in with the self-deprecating commentary, are some real glimpses into our hero's minds - one in particular - providing some much-needed gravity we weren't expecting.\n\nAt its heart, Deadpool & Wolverine is still a Fox film, parading around in the dead skin of the ever-sinking MCU that Wade Wilson so badly wants to join to finally be considered one of the cool kids. Right from the word go, we're introduced again to Deadpool and series-staples Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Colossus, and Blind Al, before he's whisked away by the Time Variance Authority to join the 'Sacred Timeline'. Meta much?\n\nWe learn, through some TVA shenanigans (we'd advise watching Loki first if you're not sure what that's all about) that Wade's timeline is dying and that he's being summoned to the coolest of universes. But first, Mr Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) explains that Wade must leave his friends and universe behind before jumping ship.\n\nAnd such is the film's plot, set up in all of fifteen minutes, with Deadpool on a mission to save his world before it withers away entirely. This all serves to simply get us to the good stuff ASAP. You know exactly what we're talking about.\n\nWolverine is back, baby. But you already knew that. How he gets there - and how he ends up... where he does for most of the movie, we'll leave you to discover for yourselves in theatres. The film's plot, as it constantly reminds us through its tone and desire to have Deadpool and Wolverine swearing and sticking swords into each other, doesn't really matter. It's simply the medium necessary to get the ball rolling.\n\nAnd that's probably where we take most issue with Deadpool & Wolverine (aside from an egregiously middling performance from Macfadyen). The plot, which sees Deadpool and Wolverine taking on one Cassandra Nova, despite regularly painting the MCU as the true villain, feels thin and rushed all to give viewers more of what they came for - Wolverine, an endless stream of cameos, and even more inside jokes.\n\nOn the surface, it's not all that big a deal. Deadpool has always been a fourth-wall-breaking character that would rather spend time on jokes and exquisite action sequences, but Deadpool & Wolverine is different. It emphasizes the jokes and cameos which are seemingly only there to say \"Look! We're swearing in a Disney film!\" or \"We own Fox now\". All that means is that even less time is spent on developing the leads - something the previous Deadpool films managed well enough, especially the first one.\n\nThe (very) few occasions where the movie takes a quiet moment for itself, is where it shines brightest. The writers - of which there are five, Reynolds included - heavily lean on Jackman to deliver a performance to truly sell the horrors of Logan's past and his current state of mind. Cherish those moments. It won't be long before the writers conjure up some new character to spend all of five minutes on before hopping to the next big set piece.\n\nImmaculate vibes (and some pretty good acting too)\n\nThat's not to say we didn't at least enjoy ourselves through the two-hour runtime. We have our issues with the story and at times odd pacing, but it's the charisma of Ryan Reynolds and the loveable yet stern face of Hugh Jackman that really carry this movie through to the end. We may not have laughed at each of Deadpool's crude comments, but Reynold's magnetic delivery and Jackman's reactions continued to get chuckles out of us.\n\nReynolds has quite literally embodied the character ever since he got his first true crack at the character in 2016, and Jackman has been pulling off spectacular performances ever since the early days of the original X-Men films and ultimately, Logan. Don't let Jackman's 55 years of age convince you otherwise. He's just as much Wolverine now as he was twenty years ago, even if a little more light-hearted, and for that we're grateful.\n\nAs for the rest, The Crown's Emma Corrin and Succession's Matthew Macfadyen prominent among them, who fill the roles of Cassandra Nova and Mr Paradox respectively, are only given small moments to state their case. Here, Corrin manages to excel as an evil Charles Xavier doppelganger, despite suffering from the usual Marvel-y, MacGuffin-chasing, evil-for-the-sake-of-it writing that bogs her down during her brief screen time.\n\nWhen the claws come out\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine still manages to be a whole lot of fun. There's no doubt about that. That all comes down to Shawn Levy's distinct directing style that so perfectly suits someone like Ryan Reynolds, who appeared in both Free Guy and The Adam Project under Levy's helm. From the over-the-top action sequences complete with Madonna singles and silly cameos, there's always something to dig your claws into. Except the story, of course.\n\nIt'd be a crime if Levy didn't at least include the almost obligatory Deadpool vs. Wolverine showdown, and he doesn't disappoint. Letting two characters who simply cannot die go at it for a couple of minutes was never not going to work. It's all elevated beyond the usual \"Avengers Assemble\" sequences to some excellent creative cinematography and more colour than we've become used to of late.\n\nIf you've done your homework, and not just on the MCU but the wider Marvel Universe (and even beyond that at times), you won't miss out on the humour and callbacks in Deadpool & Wolverine. From age-old cameos that pay tribute to the Fox universe, to the plot essentially hinging on Loki's TVA, it all feels designed to keep the audience focused on references, rather than the plot.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine verdict\n\nLook, we desperately wanted to love Deadpool & Wolverine, and instead walked out of the theatre only liking it thanks to the enigmatic characters, superb action and hit-or-miss humour. Compare it to something like the poster child for Phase 5 - Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania - and you'll have us praising Deadpool & Wolverine until the cows come home.

However, the character of Deadpool gained mainstream popularity and prominence after his self-titled series got more comedic and meta, starting with \"Deadpool #28\" in 1997. Since then, he became less serious and much more of a comedic foil to other more serious heroes -- such as the X-Men's resident grump, Wolverine -- vastly exceeding the popularity of his initial villainous incarnation.\n\nLater, star Ryan Reynolds got interested in the role after the comic book Deadpool himself compared his appearance to \"Ryan Reynolds crossed with a shar-pei\" in a 2004 issue. After a bumpy start adapting the character to the big screen with an ill-fated cameo in 2009's \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" (where they sewed his iconic mouth shut!), Reynolds eventually starred in two commercially successful and critically acclaimed comics-accurate films.\n\nWhile Deadpool had a tumultuous initial journey to the movies, it was just as tumultuous of a time getting into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with lots of fits and starts.

(Again?)", "body": "Editor's Note: The following contains spoilers for 'Deadpool & Wolverine'\n\nThe Big Picture\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine ends with a lighthearted conclusion that sets up a bright future for the two iconic characters. The film features a climactic battle against Cassandra Nova's army, including an epic showdown with the Deadpool Corps. Deadpool and Wolverine sacrifice themselves to stop Cassandra Nova, but ultimately survive and receive pardons for their crimes.\n\nThe fates of several characters from Marvel movie history are revealed in Deadpool & Wolverine, particularly in the film's epic ending. As the lengthy adventure of Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan (Hugh Jackman) draws to a close in the historic Marvel Cinematic Universe film, it becomes a bit more clear what could be in store for the two heroes and their cast of amazing friends. We say \"could,\" as the overall plot of Deadpool & Wolverine is more self-contained than you might think, and the humorous end-credits scene doesn't really directly set up what we can expect next.\n\nWhile many were expecting that Deadpool and/or Wolverine would die in the most recent Marvel adventure, the reality is much more lighthearted. It's a conclusion that sets up a bright and hopeful future for its two title characters in future Marvel projects, indicating that Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman aren't necessary through portraying these iconic characters just yet. Still, the ending leaves quite a few questions, and we'll do our best to recap the key points.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\n810\n\nSuperhero\n\nAction\n\nComedy\n\nSci-Fi\n\nWolverine joins the \"merc with a mouth\" in the third installment of the Deadpool film franchise.\n\nRelease Date July 26, 2024\n\nDirector Shawn Levy\n\nCast Ryan Reynolds , Matthew Macfadyen , Morena Baccarin , Hugh Jackman , Karan Soni , Rob Delaney\n\nDeadpool, Wolverine, and their Team Face Cassandra Nova's Army\n\nBefore facing the dreaded Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) and her veritable army of B-list Marvel villains, Deadpool and Wolverine make some very interesting friends. The resistance members they form a quick bond with include the Wolverine clone X-23 (Dafne Keen), the skilled assassin Elektra (Jennifer Garner), the daywalking vampire hunter Blade (Wesley Snipes), and the New Orleans-born mutant Gambit (Channing Tatum). Together, they put a plan in action to get Deadpool back to his home dimension and stop the rogue Time Variance Authority agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) from destroying it.\n\nOnce they arrive, the bloodbath begins, and Deadpool and Wolverine attempt to distract Cassandra Nova. Meanwhile, X-23 and the rest of the team are working on getting Juggernaut's helmet, which should stop Nova from using her psychic powers. Nova nearly gets the upper hand when she invades Wolverine's mind, but this is all part of the plan. Before long, Deadpool gets Juggernaut's helmet on Nova, but she's soon shot by Paradox's spy, Pyro (Aaron Stanford). The two heroes manage to save Nova, who, in return, sends the two back to Deadpool's dimension. It almost looks like they broke through to the deranged murderer and set her on a redemption half, but Cassandra is back to causing trouble only a few minutes later.\n\nCassandra Nova Summons an Army of Deadpools to Fight Wade and Logan\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine show up to shut down Mr. Paradox's machine, but before they can, Cassandra Nova has already shown up. She extracts the information about the machine he's making directly from his skull, and decides she's going to use its power to destroy the entire multiverse. Our two heroes, of course, want to stop her, but unfortunately, Nova has already thought ahead. She's summoned the one thing that Wolverine in particular fears most - more Deadpools.\n\nThe Deadpool Corps consists of Deadpool variants from all across the multiverse, and they're prepared to stop Wade and Logan at any cost (as long as that cost isn't hurting Dogpool). Deadpool and Wolverine have come too far to fail now, so they get ready to take on the legion of Deadpools. Wolverine is so prepared for the fight that, after almost twenty-five years of waiting, he puts on that iconic cowl for the very first time. In a one-take sequence in a similar vein to the hallway fight in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, Wade and Logan shred through the Deadpool Corps, though they regenerate to fight again almost instantly. Thankfully, Peter (Rob Delaney) arrives in the nick of time to save them, as all the Deadpools immediately forget about fighting when they see their best friend Peter.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine Nearly Sacrifice Themselves to Stop Cassandra Nova\n\nAfter dealing with the Deadpool Corps, Deadpool and Wolverine grill Mr. Paradox for answers. Cassandra Nova has already accessed the device, and Paradox tells them that the only way to stop her is to destroy the complex wires beneath her. The only problem is destroying them would disrupt the fabric of space and time, killing everyone who is still inside. Unfortunately, this even applies to immortal mutants like Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\nGiven all the trauma and grief he's experienced, Wolverine is more than willing to sacrifice himself for the greater good. However, Deadpool steals his moment and locks himself inside the chamber, as he's equally willing to sacrifice himself to save his world. Wolverine isn't letting him get away that easily, and breaks inside, so the two can destroy the universe-ending device together. They successfully destroy the device and disintegrate Cassandra Nova, but the two heroes are nowhere to be found.\n\nIn another connection to Loki, the TVA overseer formerly known as Hunter B-15 (Wunmi Mosaku) arrives to find out what happened here. Mr. Paradox fabricates a story that he was the one who stopped Cassandra Nova, but he's in for a rude awakening when Deadpool and Wolverine show up. As it turns out, the combined power of the two of them was enough to withstand the power of the device. Peter once again arrives at the perfect time to confirm their story, and it seems like an instant romantic spark forms between him and Hunter B-15. In the end, Deadpool and Wolverine are pardoned for their crimes against the timelines and Paradox is brought back to the TVA to face justice on his own. The two also convince B-15 to help out the resistance members they left behind.\n\nDeadpool Reunites His Family in His Timeline\n\nClose\n\nWith Deadpool and Wolverine now safe, not only does Deadpool reunite with his friends at the end of the film, but they also manage to get X-23 back to his timeline, thus reuniting her and Wolverine. Wolverine, in return, convinces Deadpool to try restarting the spark he lost with Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Overall, it's a happy ending for the 20th Century Studios heroes, but it seems more than likely that we'll see them again later down the line of the Multiverse Saga.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is in theaters now.

The film leaves the possibility open, with the pair ending as friends, but there's no indication that they'll set out on another joint adventure.\n\nSpeaking to Collider, Reynolds appeared to downplay the possibility, describing Deadpool & Wolverine as a \"one-off\".\n\n\"The movie was not meant to be a commercial for another movie,\" Reynolds said. \"It was really, genuinely meant to be a true one-off.\"\n\nDirector Shawn Levy, however, implied there is a chance of a sequel. \"I feel like we not only had fun, but it was so creatively fulfilling. Anything's possible.\"\n\nWhat about Deadpool 4?\n\nIt's unclear whether Deadpool will receive another solo outing, but Deadpool & Wolverine suggests there's some bigger plan for the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the film, Dr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) tells Deadpool he's been \"chosen for a higher purpose\", so it's likely Reynolds will return to the character in some capacity.\n\nSpeaking to Variety, Reynolds said he could see himself returning as \"part of an ensemble\", which might suggest an appearance in Avengers: The Kang Dynasty in 2026.\n\nAsked how much longer he can see himself playing Deadpool, Reynolds replied: \"I don't know.

Do They Join The MCU?", "body": "Many people are eager to know whether Deadpool and Wolverine die or survive at the end of their latest adventure. This question has gained significant attention following the release of Deadpool & Wolverine, leaving fans speculating about the fate of these beloved characters and their potential future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).\n\nFor those interested in understanding the conclusion of Deadpool & Wolverine and whether these iconic heroes join the MCU, here's all you need to know.\n\nAre Deadpool and Wolverine dead or alive at the end?\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine don't die and are still alive at the end of Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nThe film's climax involves a high-stakes battle against Cassandra Nova, who intends to use the Time Ripper to destroy all timelines except the Void. To stop her, Wolverine and Deadpool must create an energy bridge to short-circuit the machine, a process that poses a high risk of death.\n\nInitially, Wolverine volunteers to make the sacrifice, driven by guilt and feeling he has nothing left to lose. However, Deadpool, valuing Wolverine's friendship and determined to protect him, locks Wolverine out and attempts to short-circuit the Time Ripper himself.\n\nAs Deadpool begins to disintegrate from the process, Wolverine breaks in, grabs Deadpool's hand, and together they complete the energy bridge. This act of teamwork successfully destroys the Time Ripper and kills Cassandra Nova in the process, saving the multiverse from her destructive plan.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine survive the battle, with the TVA (Time Variance Authority) arresting Mr. Paradox. They celebrate their victory by enjoying a shawarma together. Wolverine integrates into Deadpool's life, reuniting with Laura (X-23), while Deadpool reconnects with Vanessa, highlighting their personal resolutions and the deepening of their relationships.\n\nDo Deadpool and Wolverine join the MCU's Earth-616 sacred timeline?\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine do not join the MCU's Earth-616 sacred timeline. Instead, they remain in their own universe, the Fox universe, which is now part of the broader MCU multiverse.\n\nThroughout the film, Deadpool is offered the chance to join the MCU by the TVA, but he chooses to save his own world instead of leaving it for Earth-616. This decision underscores the importance of his universe's continuity and his dedication to protecting it.\n\nWhile Deadpool and Wolverine are now part of the MCU's multiverse, they exist in their own separate universe.

Disney just celebrated its 100 years. I think these characters will be around for another 100 years long after all of us. For sure there will be.

He also appeared in the X-Men prequel films X-Men: First Class (2011), X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014), and X-Men: Apocolypse (2016), as well as in Deadpool 2 (2018) through archival footage.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine will be the tenth time Jackman has portrayed Wolverine in film.

Yet, what fans might not expect, is an abundance of Wolverines in a multiverse-hopping montage. Deadpool & Wolverine is a lot of fun, and it's an MCU movie that isn't afraid to be its R-rated self and provides plenty of bloody violence and foul language: perfect for Wolverine.\n\nRelated\n\nAll 21 Cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine features an abundance of cameos from across the Marvel Universe, and beyond.\n\nAs fans jump into the latest MCU outing, they can expect more than one Wolverine to pop up. Yet, those who are unfamiliar with the comics might want to learn more about what Wolverine variants show up in Deadpool & Wolverine so that they can better understand the exciting cameo choices.\n\nSpoilers ahead for Deadpool & Wolverine!\n\n10 Logan\n\nHugh Jackman's Swan Song Returns As A Corpse\n\nDespite Ryan Reynolds assuring fans that they wouldn't touch Logan (2017), it's safe to say that he verbally and physically lied, for he does more than just touch Logan. He desecrates and defiles his corpse. The beginning of the film is a stark reminder that nothing is off limits with Deadpool, as Wade Wilson begins to dig up the grave of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine who died at the end of Logan (2017), complete with the scenic nature of North Dakota and the X that marks his grave as an X-Man.\n\nWhilst this cameo isn't one that talks, it is one of importance, as this Wolverine was the anchor of Wade's universe, and in death, his universe will slowly deteriorate over thousands of years. The Logan seen here is just an adamantium skeleton with some rotten flesh, with the tree that impaled him still in his chest.\n\n9 Henry Cavill as Wolverine\n\nThe DCEU's Superman Makes The Perfect Wolverine\n\nOne of the more exciting cameos in Deadpool & Wolverine comes in the form of a tall and muscular actor, one that fans might not expect. For the first time in 24 years, Wolverine is played by another person in live-action, and of course, it's none other than Henry Cavill. Cavill looks the part, and it's great to see him again, and even Deadpool can't help but make a sly joke at DC's expense for how they treated the former Superman of the DCEU who received one solo movie and a bundle of post-credit teasers.\n\nHenry Cavill's voice and mannerisms as Wolverine are brief, but it's clear that he is the right fit for the character, especially with his bulging biceps that he reloads to punch Deadpool back through a TVA time door. This Wolverine is so cool that he even breaks Disney's 'no smoking' policy, as he can be seen with a cigar in his mouth.\n\n8 Patch\n\nOne Of Wolverine's Eyepatch-Wearing Disguises\n\nDeadpool finds himself in a casino, where he comes face to face with another Wolverine variant (also of course played by Hugh Jackman). This variant wears a white suit with a black bowtie and has a striking eyepatch over his left eye. Even Deadpool seems to know who he is, as he immediately says hello by referring to this Wolverine as Patch.\n\nIn the comics, Patch is one of Wolverine's hidden identities which he uses to infiltrate criminal circles whilst working as a vigilante in Madripoor. It's a fun throwback to the 80s and another cool look for Hugh Jackman to have to showcase Wolverine's cool adventures in the comics.\n\n7 Comic-Accurate Wolverine\n\nA Wolverine That Is Definitely Not 6 Foot Tall\n\nOne of the first Wolverines seen in the montage is Hugh Jackman, but this time, it's more comic-accurate. As fans of the character might know, Wolverine is actually 5'3\", and Hugh Jackman stands at a tall 6'2\". The almost foot difference between the two might showcase a few inaccuracies in height, but in looks, mannerisms, and biceps, they are practically the same, which is why it's hilarious and surprising to see a short king version of Wolverine.\n\nWhilst this comic-accurate version of Wolverine is played for comedic effect, he certainly looks even smaller than 5'3\", and perhaps it's a meta-joke on how people over the years have said they want a shorter Wolverine compared to what they have with Hugh Jackman.\n\n6 The Worst Wolverine\n\nDeadpool's New Favorite Wolverine\n\nThe main Wolverine for Deadpool & Wolverine is also known as the Worst Wolverine, a mutant who lets down his entire world. This version of Wolverine has an expansive backstory that expresses tragedy and regret and also explains his spiraling alcoholism. It's a Wolverine that hates himself and can't see himself as a hero for the things he has done.\n\nRelated\n\n6 Worst Things Deadpool Has Done To Wolverine\n\nIn the Marvel comics, Deadpool has committed a few atrocities against Wolverine outside of just being annoying.\n\nNevertheless, it's the Wolverine that Deadpool is stuck with, and one that just might be able to redeem himself to prove that even if he is the wrong guy, he doesn't have to be, and he can be the hero that the X-Men knew he could be for them and the world.\n\n5 Uncanny X-Men #251's Crucified Wolverine\n\nA Wolverine Crucified On A Giant X\n\nDropping into another universe, Wolverine finds himself in a rainy location filled with bloodied skulls. Whilst the sight of an ocean of skulls is scary enough, he looks up to find Wolverine crucified on a giant yellow X. This is a classic nod to the Marc Silvestri comic cover for Uncanny X-Men #251, which depicts Wolverine in a tragedy.\n\nIt's one of the most iconic Wolverine comic covers of all time. The cover even has some story implications inside Uncanny X-Men #251, where Wolverine is hung from a wooden X by the Reavers and is deeply haunted by hallucinations. Now the last thing he needs is a Deadpool looking in on that hallucination.\n\n4 Clint Eastwood Wolverine?\n\nA Different Side To Old Man Logan\n\nThere's one Wolverine in particular that stands out, and it can easily be seen as Mark Millar and Steve McNiven's Old Man Logan, but there's something off about it. This version of Logan is old, but he's also in a mountain region, and his outfit and equipment make it seem like he's in the Old West. He also uses a shotgun, whereas the Logan from Old Man Logan swears against violence when he's with his family.\n\nIt could be that this Wolverine is inspired by Clint Eastwood, or at least a Wolverine that was supposed to be the classic cowboy actor turned director. The makeup and scarring somewhat resemble him, and Clint Eastwood has always been a popular casting choice due to their similarities.\n\n3 Age of Apocalypse Wolverine\n\nA One-Handed Wolverine\n\nA wild set of hair and mutton chops greets Deadpool when he enters yet another universe in search of a Wolverine. This time, Deadpool finds himself on Earth-295, facing off against a rageful Wolverine amidst a dystopian future where humanity has been culled, and this world's Wolverine, Weapon Omega, was its cause.\n\nRelated\n\nMarvel: Best Wolverine Runs In The Comics\n\nWolverine's the best there is at what he does, and what that involves is a whole lot of violence, providing some brilliant Marvel comic runs.\n\nThis is a Wolverine that features in the comics as more feral and deadly in nature and uses the Weapon X alias over Wolverine. First appearing in 1994's X-Men: Alpha, this Wolverine would have his left hand replaced by adamantium in a battle against Cyclops, showcasing the dark future that awaits a potential Logan.\n\n2 John Byrne's Brown and Yellow Wolverine\n\nA Classic Costume For A Classic Hulk Battle\n\nFamed writer and artist John Byrne gets a name drop from Deadpool when he enters into another Wolverine's world. This is the first variant audiences see with a comic-accurate costume, and it's the classic yellow and brown outfit that was designed by John Byrne when he arrived on the X-Men scene back in the 80s.\n\nNot only is it awesome to see Hugh Jackman in the classic brown-ochre Wolverine suit that was teased in a deleted end scene of The Wolverine (2013), but it's also a Wolverine that gets to fight the Incredible Hulk. Even if fans don't get to see the fight, it's a brilliant homage to Wolverine's first appearance.\n\n1 Wolverine (1988) #1\n\nThe Original Solo Series' First Outfit\n\nThere's one variant of Wolverine that's rather hard to pin down due to his location and costume, but it's more than likely that it's a nod to Wolverine's first-ever solo series adventure with 1988's Wolverine #1. The cover itself features a Wolverine with much longer hair than usual, and an outfit that looks like something an old-school wrestler would wear.\n\nFrom the cover of Wolverine #1 by John Buscema and Al Williamson, it's clear that Marvel is featuring a homage to some of the creators out there who helped to make Wolverine the famed name and look that he deserves.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nRelease

A few of them are just last-minute buttons on a gag from the movie, like The Avengers' wordless shawarma-eating scene, or the giant ant playing drums after Ant-Man and the Wasp. But most of them are designed to move the focus from the movie you're currently watching to the next planned film in Marvel Studios' lineup, with some kind of teaser for the future.\n\nGiven all the cameos, references, and future teases in Deadpool & Wolverine, fans might go in expecting a post-credits scene that teases a Deadpool 4 or a Deadpool & Wolverine 2. You might think you're getting a tease of the first full MCU X-Men movie, given the way Marvel has used multiverse shenanigans to ease the X-Men into the universe after Disney acquired 20th Century Fox, the franchise's former home. Or maybe you're expecting a tease for Blade, Captain America: Brave New World, or another film still to come on the MCU Phase Five roster.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine goes in a different direction, more in line with the two Deadpool movies that star Ryan Reynolds made before Disney got control of the character rights in the Fox acquisition. The first Deadpool spent its post-credits scene on a Ferris Bueller's Day Off homage, albeit with a small tease that Cable would be part of the Deadpool 2 story. And Deadpool 2 doesn't have a post-credits scene at all -- just a mid-credits montage of time-travel antics.\n\nSo let's talk about what is and isn't in Deadpool & Wolverine's mid-credits and end-credits scenes, and what it says about the future of the Deadpool franchise.\n\nDoes Deadpool & Wolverine have a post-credits scene?\n\nSure does, but it isn't a sequel teaser of any kind -- it's a look backward, not forward. The post-credits scene adds to an earlier scene in the movie, revealing that one of Deadpool's most surprising acts in the movie wasn't quite as callous and murderous as it looked. (He's still a mouthy asshole, but that's nothing new.)\n\n[Ed. note: Warning: Significant spoilers lie ahead.]\n\nWhat happens in Deadpool & Wolverine's post-credits scene?\n\nSomewhere around the midpoint of Deadpool & Wolverine, the two title characters (played by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman) wind up in The Void, the dimensional garbage heap of the Time Variance Authority from the Loki TV series. Along with various characters from the X-Men roster, they meet Johnny Storm, aka the Human Torch from the Fantastic Four, as played by Chris Evans in Tim Story's 2005 movie.\n\nThey all get captured by Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), Professor Xavier's powerfully psychic and psychotic twin. Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, promptly mouths off to her, claiming Johnny said all sorts of profane things about her, including that she's a \"megalomaniacal psychotic asshole\" who can \"lick my goddamn cinnamon ring clean and kick rocks all the way to bald hell.\" While Johnny nervously protests that he never said any of that, Cassandra responds by psychically ripping off his skin, killing him in a comedically grotesque way. Wolverine spends the rest of the movie blaming Deadpool for cavalierly getting Johnny murdered.\n\nThe post-credits scene features Deadpool denying the \"absolutely vile rumors that I got Johnny killed,\" and showing footage from the scene that we didn't see the first time, where Johnny does actually say all those things. And he adds, \"In fact, I don't give a shit if she removes all my skin and pops me like some nightmarish blood balloon! If the last thing I do with this godforsaken cum-gutter existence is light that fuck-box on fire, I still won't die happy. That's right, Wade, I won't be happy until I've urinated on her freshly barbecued corpse and husk-fucked the charred remains while gargling Juggernaut's jugger-nuts. And you can quote me.\"\n\nThe whole scene is mostly just a gag on Evans' squeaky-clean MCU persona when he was playing Captain America -- the guy who spent nearly a dozen MCU movies refusing to swear, and protesting (\"Language!\") when other people do. It's also meant to at least partially vindicate Wade, and make him seem a little less casually culpable for Johnny's death. But c'mon, man, everybody knows snitches get stitches.\n\nWhat happens in Deadpool & Wolverine's mid-credits scene?\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine's credits scenes aren't all about watching Chris Evans drop F-bombs: A mid-credits montage set to Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" goes for earnestness, stringing together behind-the-scenes footage and interviews from every corner of 20th Century Fox's Marvel Comics films.\n\nEmphasis on \"every corner.\" The clips include moments from classics like Logan and the 2000 X-Men, but give them equal weight with footage from bombs like Elektra and the 2015 Fantastic Four. And there's a particular focus on Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds behind the scenes in their respective first Marvel movies, X-Men and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Those clips showcase some real heart -- candid moments full of smiling, famous faces that are, in some cases, 25 years younger than we're used to seeing them. It's an acknowledgement of the human artists behind these IP behemoths, a welcome touch of sincerity after Deadpool & Wolverine spent much of its run time mocking, wallowing in, and calling back to (if not truly continuing) their work.\n\nIt's difficult to read the montage as anything other than a goodbye to 20th Century Fox's Marvel output.\n\nSo what does that mean for a Deadpool 4?\n\nIt's notable that Deadpool & Wolverine does not end with \"Deadpool and Wolverine will return,\" Marvel Studios' habitual ending line. And while we don't know much about what the company plans for its mutant characters going forward, it doesn't seem like Deadpool is a part of those plans -- at least not at the moment.\n\nWhile Marvel Studios has begun to tease mutant characters in the MCU and its parallel universe, particularly in Ms. Marvel and The Marvels, the company is still only in the early stages of a full film intro for the X-Men. Michael Lesslie (The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes) is currently set to write one, but there's no director attached yet -- or at least, Marvel hasn't announced one as of the moment of publication.\n\nAnd in spite of Deadpool & Wolverine's quips about Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine until he's 90, Jackman isn't under contract for any more movies, as far as we know. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has stated pretty clearly that the plan from here is to make the MCU's mutants distinct from 20th Century Fox's.\n\nGiven how well Deadpool & Wolverine is trending in early box office sales, there's always a chance that Deadpool simply becomes too profitable for Disney to not continue his story in some cinematic form. But for the moment, at least, Deadpool & Wolverine seems to be a farewell to this version of both its title characters.", "source": {"uri": "polygon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Polygon"},

Find out more about how we test, analyze, and rate.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was lucky enough to get to preview the first 35 minutes of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\". Off the back of that opening act, I was convinced it was going to be the best Marvel movie in years. Having now seen the full movie, I'm still convinced that my opinion is true. Sadly, though, I'm not quite sure \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is the MCU savior we sorely need.\n\nThat's not to say it's a bad movie -- it isn't. In fact, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is a very good \"Deadpool\" movie. It's clear that those involved care about the character, and Ryan Reynolds still embodies him very, very well.\n\nIt's anarchic, violent, and foul-mouthed, and probably the most fun I've had watching a Marvel project for a while -- save for maybe the \"Loki\" season 2 finale or \"Werewolf By Night\" -- but it's also weighed down by some issues.\n\nAhead of its release, we sifted through early reviews and found that the \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" Rotten Tomatoes score wasn't as good as it seemed, \"Top Critics\" from the platform were cooler on the movie than its 81% rating might suggest.\n\nAfter watching the entire thing myself, I can see why; I think \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is a great \"Deadpool\" movie... but it's not necessarily the great movie I thought it was going to be I've explained why I think that below, and don't worry; I've tried to keep things as spoiler-free as possible.\n\nWhen I first left the theater, my immediate thought was \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" felt like \"Fanservice: The Movie.\"\n\nIf you've spent the past seven years desperately waiting to see Ryan Reynolds' return as the Merc with the Mouth, spewing lewd comments and filthy dialogue every other second and tearing up bad guys with his arsenal of weapons, you'll be well-served here. Pairing him with a gruff and tough Hugh Jackman (still an excellent Wolverine) turns the movie into a very funny buddy comedy -- but one where our lead pair are more than happy to rip one another to shreds when either of them touches a nerve.\n\nEqually, comic book die-hards will be grinning from ear to ear throughout. \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is gleefully happy to be a comic book movie, and especially one that can now fully immerse itself in mocking the MCU (even if it falls into some of the same traps it jokes about).\n\nThroughout, you'll see some real comic book movie wish-fulfillment play out. Familiar faces from both modern Marvel and pre-MCU stars (yes, besides Wolverine and in addition to those spoiled in all the trailers) step back into the frame for another slice of the action.\n\nEvery few minutes, viewers in my preview screening erupted into cheers and applause as another face turned up, or Deadpool referenced and/or set crossed into a particular comic book timeline. Think the reaction to those returns from \"Spider-Man: No Way Home,\" but turned up to 11, and for movie characters who perhaps haven't been remembered quite as fondly.\n\nThe big problem with stuffing all that fan service in was that it meant \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" didn't really have room to breathe and to tell a story. Buried under all the shock cameos and whoop-worthy appearances, there should been a story to cling to, but what's there is very thinly wrought and uneven.\n\nThere's an overarching \"save the world\" storyline in there but it is constantly playing second fiddle to all the fanservice, the fourth-wall asides, crude jokes, or the violence that has been packed in. Because of this, we get too many elements crammed together, an underutilized villain, and stakes that don't feel high -- even though they're supposed to.\n\nPlus, since the main pay-off therefore becomes seeing what surprises are in store throughout... I can't see myself wanting to revisit \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" in the same way I've rewatched some of my other Marvel favorites several times over.\n\nAnd while 'chaotic' is a vibe you'd associate with Deadpool, things are a bit all over the place. Some action sequences are well-staged, while others fall into the traps of \"what's going on\" shakycam and super-quick cuts that I genuinely struggled to follow on-screen. And as you might expect at this point, though the visuals are certainly better than \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,\" CGI issues continue to plague the MCU even here.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is not a bad watch. I've made my complaints, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the ride. I'm certain that plenty of people are going to have a very good time with it, especially on the first viewing, and it'll probably make bank at the box office.\n\nMore than anything else, I felt like I needed to write this piece to course-correct away from my initial optimism and maybe set expectations a little bit. Arguably the core theme here is redemption -- fitting, given the MCU low point we're in -- but I don't think \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" ever quite manages to reinvigorate the MCU in the way it kind of wants to; this is not the next \"Infinity War\".\n\nAll that said, I'm confident that Marvel fans, blockbuster chasers looking for crass laughs and quick thrills, or die-hard comic book fans are going to leave their showing pretty damn happy. And if you don't, you can always try watching one of the best flicks from Tom's Guide's roundup of the top 100 superhero movies instead.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" hits theaters on July 26, 2024 and is now showing in the UK.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_shore@tomsguide.com", "name": "Martin Shore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werewolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Werewolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man:_No_Way_Home", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spider-Man: No Way Home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fan service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_and_the_Wasp:_Quantumania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer-generated imagery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MR7MpD3jGEiwYDpjF6q9i6-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

You've been warned.\n\nAfter Spider-Man: No Way Home ended up being one of the biggest movies ever while also paying tribute to past Peter Parkers, it only made sense to do something similar with Fox's Marvel properties now that everything is being rounded up into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Enter Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nThis attempt at closure isn't nearly so clean as No Way Home's, though, because there's just too much stuff and they drew from all over--and, very conspicuously, we don't get any appearances by any members of the X-Men other than Wolverine himself. So it's not really much of a bow for the old X-Men franchise overall. But, as we'll discuss below, it sort of enables the possibility for one to happen later, and the pieces have already been put in place for that after The Marvels last year.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine picks up not long after the events of Deadpool 2. Wade meets with Happy Hogan and tries to join the Avengers. Happy says no, and Wade decides to retire from doing violence and sell cars instead.\n\nAnd then some folks from the Time Variance Authority (TVA)--the folks from the Loki series who control the multiverse--show up and pull Wade out of time and bring him to a man called Paradox. Paradox says Deadpool's universe is dying because its anchor being, Wolverine, was killed during the events of Logan, and he wants Deadpool to help him finish it off using something called a \"time ripper\"--if he does so, he'll get to join the MCU and become an Avenger. Why he would ask Deadpool to do this is unclear, as is what he was going to actually get Deadpool to do--neither topic is ever broached. Instead, Deadpool goes rogue and starts hopping through timelines to find a suitable Wolverine to replace our dead one.\n\nWe're then treated to a fun montage of alternate Wolverines, including a Henry Cavill one, and eventually he finds the title character, who's getting drunk at a bar. Deadpool brings this Logan back to the TVA, and Paradox is baffled because this doesn't help his plan at all--so he pokes them both with one of those glowy TVA time sticks and sends them to \"the Void,\" a post-apocalyptic place that exists at the end of every timeline.\n\nNaturally, we get a lot of Mad Max jokes here as we meet lots of random folks from various Fox Marvel movies--such as Pyro from X2 and The Last Stand, and a brand-new version of the Juggernaut, complete with hilarious, comic-accurate helmet. These baddies are led by one Cassandra Nova, Professor X's evil twin sister who died in the womb. She has all the same powers as Xavier, except she has to actually physically touch your brain to read your thoughts--something she does a lot Deadpool & Wolverine, to very creepy effect. She's basically the god of this world.\n\nShe demonstrates this for us early on with the first member of the local superhero resistance: Johnny Storm from the original Fantastic Four movies, played by Chris Evans. Evans' time in the film is short but incredibly sweet, and Deadpool wraps it up by telling Cassandra that Johnny had said a bunch of graphically violent things he wanted to do to her, which Johnny claims is totally fake. Cassandra doesn't care, and pulls all the skin from his body with a single gesture, causing his carcass to collapse into a pile of bones and meat. Fortunately, there are other resistance folks out there as well: Dafne Keen's X-23, Jennifer Garner's Elektra, Wesley Snipes' Blade, and Channing Tatum's Gambit (a long-rumored project that never actually happened).\n\nTogether, they storm Cassandra's base, which is built into Ant-Man's gigantic corpse (it's not explained). Deadpool and Wolverine are able to render Cassandra powerless by putting the Juggernaut's big helmet on her, but in the middle of the confrontation, she's shot by Pyro, who's been told by Paradox he can return to his timeline if he kills her. This inspires Logan to save her life, for some reason, which in turn inspires Cassandra to send them back to the timeline using a sling ring she took from a Doctor Strange at some point in the past.\n\nBut after she does, she finds out from Pyro that Paradox tried to kill her, and she decides to end everything. She goes to New York to use the time ripper herself, and in the process unleashes the Deadpool Corps--all the Deadpool variants from the Void. And our Deadpool and Wolverine have to fight them. Which they do, but everybody survives their gruesome injuries except for Nicepool, who doesn't have regenerative healing.\n\nNow it's time to stop Cassandra, who's pulling some glowing cables out of the time-ripper device in an attempt to destroy all timelines (it is what it is). Deadpool tries to sacrifice himself by touching similar cables in a different room to stop her, but he can't reach them both, so Wolverine helps--they touch the cables, in slow motion while Madonna plays, and the timeline is saved. I know it sounds ridiculous, but that's literally what happened.\n\nHunter B-15 then swoops in to arrest Paradox for doing this whole unauthorized timeline-pruning plan in the first place, and then Deadpool asks her if they can keep the Fox universe alive and rescue Elektra, Blade and the others from the Void. Hunter B-15 agrees, and Deadpool goes back to his life and brings Wolverine and X-23 with him. The end.\n\nFor a movie that was supposed to introduce Deadpool to the MCU, it's an interesting conclusion since there aren't really any meaningful MCU connections in Deadpool & Wolverine at all. While the TVA and the Void both originated from the MCU with Loki, they technically both exist beyond it--they're outside of time, and thus above the multiverse. So these ideas serve as overworlds for all Marvel stuff now that nearly everything is under this one franchise umbrella. The timelines themselves, though, remain completely separate throughout this film, and Deadpool never enters any MCU timeline aside from the scene at the beginning of the movie with Happy Hogan--but that's an anomalous scene that doesn't make any sense even within itself, so it's probably best not to scrutinize it too much.\n\nIn any case, the integration of mutants into the MCU, and maybe even some of the versions of mutants we already know, is still coming in the future--it's a certainty after The Marvels ended with Monica Rambeau stuck in a parallel universe with the X-Man Hank McCoy, aka Beast. Deadpool & Wolverine is probably not the place to really get that party started, though, since it's a comedy. So, instead, this movie is essentially a meta story about the real-world merger between Disney and 20th Century Fox.\n\nHugh Jackman's Wolverine was always the MVP of the X-Men movie franchise, and the ones that didn't have him in it struggled at the box office--that's what it means that he's the \"anchor being\" of that universe. And with the MCU in play, and Jackman apparently done with the part after Logan, the Fox-Marvel universe is past its shelf life and ready to be put out of its misery--thus Paradox's plan to nuke the timeline.\n\nBy the end of the movie, the net effect is that nothing at all has changed. All the old Marvel franchises get to keep existing in their own timelines, including Deadpool. But it does establish all of it as being under one big multiversal umbrella, where it will be available should Marvel want to put Thomas Jane's Punisher in an Avengers movie or something. So it's basically that it enables change without enacting it.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine actually has copious content during the credits, though it's not just the normal Marvel teaser stuff. During the credits scroll, you'll be treated to a montage of behind-the-scenes videos from the X-Men films, featuring Jackman and many of his fellow former castmates who otherwise weren't in the movie.\n\nAnd then we get one more nice comedy bit at the end of the credits, where Deadpool uses TVA equipment to confirm that Johnny had said all that stuff about Cassandra--and we're treated to a delightfully crude monologue from Chris Evans.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "phil_owen@gamespot.com", "name": "Phil Owen", "type":

Live yesterday evening, Ryan Reynolds revealed, \"I've never told this story anywhere, but...the movie was originally called 'Deadpool & Friend.' I am actually not joking.

This also just goes to show that many of the leaks we get online are legit and how the way fans react can make a difference to what makes it into theaters.\n\nThe video below also includes a new clip from Deadpool & Wolverine which can be viewed at the 12:38 mark.

Regardless, the title was changed, but that was no easy task...\n\n\"I Will Never Call This Deadpool and Friend,\" Ryan Reynolds Declared\n\nClose\n\nIt seems that Reynolds had to put up a bit of a fight to change the movie from Deadpool & Friend to Deadpool & Wolverine. Which is oddly surprising, as you'd think the studio would want one of the most popular Marvel characters name-dropped in the title. Alas, this was not the case, as Reynolds explains...\n\n\"So Shawn Levy, director extraordinaire, friend to both of us, and dear friend, literally one of our best friends in the whole wide world, he and I had been sitting in the edit room for months at this point, and we called everybody at Disney and Marvel and said, \"We've got to change the title,\" and they were like, \"Well, they launch it tomorrow. We've shipped 9000 seven-foot standees to theaters all over the place that say Deadpool and Friend.' But at this point they've done this to us the whole way, right? Every time we asked them for anything we had to push so hard for it.\n\nSo, we just wouldn't take no for an answer. I will never call this Deadpool and Friend, and they did it. They did it. Yeah, I had to change my contract. My children are now emergency hospital organs for Disney leaders, but that's fine. It's worth it.\"\n\nRelated\n\nWill Another Actor Play Wolverine in the MCU?

The aggressive ad campaign preceding its release stoked excitement by underlining the inevitable personality clash of the two foul-mouthed superheroes. We last saw Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in 2017's elegiac \"Logan\", which culminated with the character's death. Reynolds, who lobbied for Jackman's return to the role, shares writing duties on the new film with its director Shawn Levy, and the additional trio of Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick and Zeb Wells.\n\nYou can tell from the opening scene, where Deadpool desecrates Wolverine's grave, that those involved are aware, albeit self-consciously, of the dissonance in raising that particular superhero from the dead for a romp with this irreverent Deadpool. It's a self-consciousness that will soon betray the filmmaking sensibilities in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" where acknowledgement of a thing is treated as the height of engagement. In this film, portentous moments of drama or humour end at the set-up - follow through is not required. For all the excitement promised in the juxtaposition between Wolverine and Deadpool, the actual film is one where exigencies of plot, characterisation, meaning, or artistic acuity are rendered incidental.\n\nParallel universes have been a preoccupation of superhero films in recent years, and that complication presents a central plot-point for \"Deadpool & Wolverine\". After the events of \"Deadpool 2\", Wade Wilson (Deadpool's alter-ego) is rejected from joining the Avengers. The rejection sends him into a tailspin that includes a break-up with his girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and him retiring from his vigilante days as Deadpool. This information is rendered in a series of sluggish flashbacks as the actual story finds Wade in the present day, where he faces a potentially life-changing predicament. Wolverine's death has doomed Wade's timeline, and although members of a formidable organisation called the Time Variance Authority are willing to save Wade, they will not save the group of friends he's come to call family. This leaves him with no choice but to steal a device, returning to his Deadpool persona, to travel through the multiverse to find a variant of Wolverine in hopes of saving his timeline. This is the decision that finds us at the opening of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\", with Deadpool performing some casual graverobbing amidst one of the more energetic fight sequences of the film.\n\nThe idea harbours enough dramatic potential to be potent but ends up more incidental than meaningful when \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" can only offer the most ambivalent lip service to what makes this group of people so meaningful to Wade. Although the in-universe plot of the film insists that Wade has spent six years without embodying the precocious persona of Deadpool, the film has little interest or ability to distinguish this third iteration of Wade or Deadpool as a figure who has been affected by anything in his past. His yearning to join the Avengers is pitched as something sincere, but the film cannot articulate how. The breakup with Vanessa is invoked throughout as an act of genuine pain for him, but the actual pain of the breakup is never truly realised in any scene that dares to approach any semblance of emotional honesty, or even cleverness. Deadpool has always used his humour to avoid his vulnerability, but the previous films have reckoned with this dichotomy in more ingenious ways. In \"Deadpool & Wolverine\", each plot turn reveals a film unwilling to confront the dramatic potential for anything emotionally risky for more than a few beats. But, who has the time for emotional stakes when there are self-referential possibilities to offer the audience on a platter?\n\nThe run up to the global premiere of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" has been rife with warnings for audiences to be mindful of revealing spoilers. It's a familiar part of the comic-book movie cycle, and especially that of Marvel's Cinematic Universe, to which \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" belongs. Films dependent on surprising plot points or unexpected character developments tend towards guarding their audience's access to information that might spoil the surprise-dependent viewing experience. But in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\", the threat of a spoiler is not bound to plot, or even characterisation. Instead, it is bound to a kind of corporate self-promotion that demonstrates an inherent shallowness of the film, and the current state of the machine that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, now in its fifth phase. Fatigue has set in.\n\nThe tightly guarded spoilers hinge on the appearance of several \"surprise\" characters - rendered in extended cameos by a handful of familiar performers. With each cameo, the momentum of the film pauses. It is as if the appearances are modulated in anticipation of a requisite thrum of entrance applause. Look, it seems to say, see who we've got to appear? Any dramatic impulse ends at the moment of recognition of the reference. At best, their appearances shuffle us along to the next lethargic plot point, and at worse they function as brief attempts to satiate us with false levity, leaving the actual film as misshapen and incongruous as ever, when they vanish. That these recurring acts, and there are many, are the height of what might be spoiled for audiences reveals a gaping emptiness at the centre of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\".\n\nIt is a tendency that exemplifies the stunning lassitude of the dramatic throughline at work in the film. The referential moments rain down on you in torrents. Deadpool's fourth-wall breaks are as foul-mouthed as before, but feel knowingly conscious that they exist within a tightly limited product that lacks the specificity of something with its own personality. Jackman wearily stalks through the film trying to draw nuance from this version of Wolverine. The formlessness is evident in the hapless intentions of the primary villain Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) whose hazy desires shift whenever the film needs it to, despite her reported power. By the halfway point it begins to feel like an aggressive onslaught wearing you down to accept its vision of entertainment as the only way for a film like this to be - a hodgepodge of things thrust together because they can be. Deadpool tells us how we should feel, and the film expects us to fall in line.\n\nEvery successive quip in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is keenly aware of the oversize power and influence the MCU has. The extensive soundtrack is excellent, spanning decades of pop music that likely cost much to licence. But all the money in the world cannot help the filmmakers use music to eloquently augment what happens on screen. The thrill is the recognition of a popular song, no further thought is put into how it functions. If we are meant to be tickled by the absurdity of how little the songs offer anything meaningful to the tension (or lack thereof) onscreen, that would only be the nail in the coffin in how much \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" emerges as a kind of anti-cinema. Meaning is scant in the actual diegesis of the film and all that we see and hear exist as merely a referent thrill to provide audiences with a spark of recognising a thing that lets us feel good about being in the know. It doesn't have to be this way. Consider the clever blend of humour and pathos in \"Deadpool 2\" which features Celine Dion's earnest mournfully singing of the original song \"Ashes\" over the irreverent credits of the film, after Deadpool suffers an emotional loss. That kind of inventive specificity is all but absent in \"Deadpool & Wolverine\".\n\nWorse yet, all the money in the world cannot help \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" to repair its stunningly flat-footed imagery. The titular duo spend much of their time in a place called the Void, a kind of purgatory where those the universe rejects are sent to waste away. In one of the infinite fourth-wall breaks, Deadpool muses about the Void's similarity to the dystopian wasteland of the Mad Max World. That \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" arrives in cinemas mere weeks after the imagistic thrills of George Miller's \"Furiosa \" only emphasises the lack of emotional identity in the onscreen images. So much of what develops feels like a startling disavowal of the visual powers of cinema and a frustrating disengagement with the visual appeal of the possibility of comic-book films. The colours on display might suggest an affinity to the energetic verve of a comic-book frame, but \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" lacks any of the visual depth that you find within a panel. This is the work of a filmmaking team that is unable or unwilling to communicate its humour through the visual potential of the cinematic form. Instead, it can only reach for the low-hanging fruit of relentless and hollow jesting.\n\nThe dramatic effect of \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" feels tantamount to filmmaking as an exercise in signifiers in place of actual substance. Each moment offers a reference, or a cameo, or a nod to something. It is movie making by way of ephemeral needling. When the emptiness of the needling is revealed, we are thrust into another sequence of listless referencing to satiate us. This is not a film that revels in the power of storytelling but is instead a formless piece of content that is happy to move from moment to moment of reference to satiate with the thrill of identifying the mere shape of a joke as its apex. It wants to wear us down - bludgeoning us with its rat-a-tat assault of trenchant quips. At every turn, this is a film that gleefully announces that every moment, every sequence, does not develop from a natural interest in building its story. Instead, it wallows in its outsize state of infallibility. It does what it wants, merely because it can. These characters deserve better.

So, that had always been there, but I just knew.\"\n\nBut don't worry, Wolverine fans. \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" finds a way to bring the character back into the action while still honoring his legacy.\n\nAt the beginning of \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) breaks the fourth wall to ask the question everyone has on their minds -- how can this movie bring back Jackman as Wolverine \"without disrespecting Logan's memory\"?\n\nDeadpool says, \"We're not,\" and then proceeds to unceremoniously dig up Wolverine's grave from \"Logan.\"\n\nA flashback after the opening sequence explains why.\n\nMr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), a member of the MCU's time-police organization called TVA, brings Deadpool in and tells him that his timeline is slowly dying because it lost its anchor person: Wolverine.\n\nParadox plans to speed up the process with a machine he's building called the time-ripper that will instantly cull Deadpool's timeline. He offers Deadpool the chance to hop over to the Sacred Timeline, but wanting to save his friends and family, Deadpool opts to stay and try to salvage their universe.\n\nBelieving that Wolverine can't actually die due to the regenerative abilities they both have, Deadpool first attempts to dig up Logan's body. But all he finds is the character's adamantium skeleton, confirming this universe's Wolverine is very much dead.\n\nAfter Deadpool unearths Wolverine's remains, a group of Paradox's TVA officers arrive to capture him. He mercilessly murders the officers one by one using Wolverine's adamantium-covered bones as weapons while dancing to NSYNC's song \"Bye Bye Bye.\"\n\nOnce they're all dead, he moves on to plan B.\n\nAfter confirming that his universe's Logan really is dead, Deadpool's next move is to search the multiverse for a different Wolverine variant to take the dead one's place. He finds multiple versions (even one played by Henry Cavill, called the Cavillrine) before coming upon one who's brooding at a bar.\n\nDeadpool brings this Wolverine to the TVA, but Mr. Paradox reveals that the plan won't work because this is the worst Wolverine.\n\nThe movie later explains that this particular Wolverine didn't want to be part of the X-Men and went off drinking. While he was out, humans murdered the X-Men and other mutants. Wolverine blamed himself for this and started killing those guilty of the attack and other innocent people.\n\nIn the movie, Wolverine explains that he wears his yellow and blue X-Men suit to remind himself of what happened and to express his shame. Deadpool's journey gives this worst Wolverine a second chance at being a hero and saving the universe.\n\nUltimately, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is not about Jackman's triumphant return as the beloved hero we all knew. Instead, by bringing Jackman in as a \"new\" version of Wolverine, the film positions its lead characters as two underdogs trying their best to save the day and live up to a high bar of expectations.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayomikun_adekaiyero@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ayomikun Adekaiyero", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandango_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandango Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paradox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_adaptation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film adaptation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adamantium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Macfadyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Macfadyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regeneration (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flashback (narrative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cavill"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a27d25aab37011780a8533?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

As Disney CEO Bob Iger has vowed to pull back on some of Marvel's output, Deadpool & Wolverine is the only offering from the studio to head to the big screen this year.\n\nBut perhaps Ryan Reynolds' Merc with a Mouth is just the character to burst into the MCU at this moment in time. IGN talked to Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige after watching the first 35 minutes of Deadpool & Wolverine last week, during which Deadpool himself directly comments on the perceived dip in quality the MCU has taken in the days after Avengers: Endgame. So of course, we had to ask: how does Feige feel about that discourse, now that they're addressing it right there in the film?\n\nBelow, IGN's Benny Watts talks to Feige about that, why Deadpool & Wolverine feels like a mid-phase reset, the R-rating, all that cocaine talk, and more.\n\nIGN: Deadpool & Wolverine almost like a mid-phase reset. So I want to ask, why are Deadpool and Wolverine the characters to do it?\n\nKevin Feige: I hadn't heard it put that way before - mid-phase reset. I like that. I think that's pretty cool, and I think a lot of that, like everyone else in life, comes down to timing. It is timing that Disney acquired Fox, that we got the rights to the characters, that we've had meetings with Ryan on and off, trying to figure out what would be the best storyline for a third Deadpool, for the first Deadpool within Marvel Studios. And the greatest bit of timing, as I'm sure you've heard, is when Hugh called Ryan and said \"I'd like to come back.\" Because if that call had come a year from now or three years before, I'm not sure - I mean, I am sure it wouldn't have been as much of a slam dunk as it was in the exact moment when he called, which was the exact same time we brought Shawn on board to direct and we were trying to crack the movie. And there were a lot of great elements that ended up in the movie people will see, but there was just something missing and we were about to say, let's slow down, retool, and figure out what was missing, when Hugh called and said, \"I'm missing.\"\n\nI've only seen the first 35 minutes, but there are jokes in the movie that reference a cultural conversation about the quality of the MCU post-Endgame, and it seems that this movie is willing to get involved in that dialogue. So I want to ask, how do you feel about the MCU's perceived quality and the particular fan perspective that things may have not lived up to the expectations?\n\nFeige: Well, I think when the expectations are \"biggest movie of all time,\" those are pretty lofty expectations. At least we were the biggest movie briefly, before Avatar was re-released. But they're high bars, and there's a dichotomy at Marvel Studios where we like being the underdog and we like exceeding expectations. But we also like setting the bar higher than the bar's ever been set before. Those are two things that are hard to keep navigating over the years.\n\nThe great thing about Deadpool is he'll just directly talk about all of it. And if you ever find yourself saying, \"It's okay if Deadpool makes fun of a lot of things, but don't make fun of me,\" you're not a cool guy. You're not a fun person. I've always said, \"Who does Deadpool make fun of the most? Ryan Reynolds.\" Deadpool makes fun of Ryan Reynolds all the time. So I think it is an honor that he now gets to poke fun at us and at Marvel.\n\nI think along those lines of where you find this getting made fun of, I'm interested in, were there any guidelines that you gave to the creative team to say, \"this is the line? We love it, this is great, but there is a limit on how far can you go\"?\n\nFeige: Shawn and Ryan know what that line is, know inherently what that line is. Ryan probably more than anyone because even though there's the F-bombs, and even though there's blood spurting with claws and katanas, there is a core decency and heart to the movie and to the characters. Ryan is the great arbiter of that.\n\n\"There's a dichotomy at Marvel Studios where we like being the underdog and we like exceeding expectations.\n\nHe put it very well at one point saying, \"Deadpool always punches up. You can punch up as much as you want. Never punch down.\" He's never mean-spirited or mean-hearted, because that's not funny. So actually, he knows where that line is.\n\nThere really wasn't anything that we had to step in and go, \"Now you've gone too far. The studio is locking down.\" There was a comment I had made at one point that I thought the cocaine jokes in the first few Deadpool movies were sort of old or felt like some sort of old '70s drug movie. It seemed dated to me. Ryan of course took that and reinterpreted it into \"studio mandate, no cocaine,\" and turned it into fresh, funny cocaine jokes.\n\nI've never talked about cocaine as much in my entire life as I have in this junket, so I appreciate it. You didn't bring it up. I brought it up. I know.\n\nShawn has said that Deadpool & Wolverine isn't part of any MCU phase that he's aware of. Does this mean that MCU films don't always have to be a part of the \"phases\" structure? Is the MCU phasing out phases?\n\nFeige: Phasing out phases? No, I mean phases have always simply been the point in time in which the project's made, and this movie is very much, as you've already referenced with Deadpool discussing the current state of the MCU, very much of its time of where we are in the phases. So I would say it's in there, but that's sort of besides the point when it comes to Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nWhat are the challenges of keeping the audience invested in characters when they can now be recast, die, reborn due to the multiverse? This is obviously a big thing in the comics, but general movie audiences can respond differently. Is that something you guys take into consideration?\n\nFeige: Well, I think the only thing we take into consideration is the story we're telling and the story we're telling in the moment. What's great about these characters in 85 years of Marvel comic history is they do go on, the characters do continue, like all great mythological characters continue. They evolve and they change.\n\nPart of what you will see in Deadpool & Wolverine is how Hugh, as this character, has changed and evolved. And some of that is based on the time we're in. Some of that is based on fictional narratives of timelines and time variance authorities. All of that is simply fun storytelling tools to get a couple of great characters that you've always wanted to see together, together in a way that honors the past, but just as importantly sets up the future.\n\nWhen you saw it, where was that point of excitement of seeing how this is this installment in the MCU and what audiences are about to say? Where was that excitement built from when you watch this film?\n\nFeige: I always love it when disparate elements of our storylines come together. So of course Deadpool and Wolverine coming together, but there are surprises throughout the movie that I think are amazing to see up on screen and to see certain combinations up on screen.\n\n\"Part of what you will see in Deadpool & Wolverine is how Hugh, as this character, has changed and evolved.\n\nEven Wolverine wearing a TVA jacket, I find fun and exciting in the way that we can combine these storylines into something that ultimately is a pure story about these two individuals and the relationship that they have, and the cathartic arc that they take together over the course of the movie. Everything else is fun Easter eggs for people who want to pay attention to such things. Like me.\n\nI want to ask about the R-rating on this film. This isn't being marketed as an R-rated film. The marketing is to a broad audience. Do you think R-rated films now, the actual rating is almost arbitrary? It's the story that's the most important thing?\n\nFeige: I think the story has always been the most important thing and I think the rating system is to give parents and audiences an indication of what can be expected. But everybody knows there's a huge range of PG movies, PG-13 movies, R movies. It is definitely an R movie with language and blood.\n\nBut I've said it is the sweetest, most wholesome R-rated movie, with characters who essentially can't be hurt because of their healing factors. So it is a very sweet movie that I think people will make their own decisions on who they want to bring with them to the movie.\n\nAlex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

That also includes Lady Deadpool, and you'll definitely recognize the actress who lends her voice to the character.\n\nLady Deadpool was first confirmed in a late trailer for the film, with just the bottom portion of her bleach blonde ponytail showing as she strutted in what looked to be an open field. Of course, now we know that wasn't a field at all.\n\nIn fact, it was the streets of the city, back in Wade Wilson's (Ryan Reynolds) home universe/timeline. As it turns out, the Deadpool horde are actually all working for Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). So, when she needs to get uninterrupted access to the time ripper, she sends the horde to handle Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\nLeading the group out of the portal is Lady Deadpool. Sadly, she doesn't unmask herself to reveal her face. But yes, the voice is exactly who the internet guessed it is.\n\nLady Deadpool is indeed played by Blake Lively.

The Marvel Studios blockbuster has prompted an avalanche of theories about potential cameos, either from existing Marvel cast members or entirely new castings. One particularly prevalent theory has been that pop superstar Taylor Swift would appear in the film, either as Dazzler, Lady Deadpool, or even a fictionalized version of herself. So, did the Taylor Swift theories finally come to fruition? Mild spoilers for Deadpool & Wolverine lurk below! Only look if you want to know!\n\nNo, Taylor Swift does not make any appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine, nor does the film mention her in any way. She also is not a component of the film's official soundtrack, which instead features hits from Madonna, The Goo Goo Dolls, and Avril Lavigne.\n\nAround the production of 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse, rumors swirled suggesting that Swift would be playing Dazzler -- a pop star with the ability to emit light energy from her hands -- after she was photographed alongside members of the film's ensemble cast. The rumors were eventually debunked, but Swift was still someone that fans suggested could play Dazzler down the line. The multiversal nature of Deadpool & Wolverine, and Swift's real-life friendship with star Ryan Reynolds and director Shawn Levy, made fans wonder if her cameo could finally happen. The fact that Swift previously donned Reynolds' Deadpool costume for Halloween in 2016 also made her a likely candidate for Lady Deadpool (who is ultimately played by Reynolds' wife, Blake Lively). Shortly before Deadpool & Wolverine debuted, Reynolds himself confirmed that Swift does not appear in the film at all.\n\n\"I will say once and for all that the cameo thing with Taylor... because she's our friend -- that is not in this film,\" Reynolds told E! News.\n\nWhat Is Deadpool & Wolverine About?\n\nIn Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) will change the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The film also stars Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox, and Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, with the return of Deadpool alums Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as Piotr Rasputin/Colossus, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Rob Delaney as Peter, and Lewis Tan as Shatterstar. Aaron Stanford is returning as Pyro from the X-Men film series, with Jennifer Garner rumored to return as Elektra Natchios.\n\nKevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy and Lauren Shuler Donner produce with Louis D'Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, George Dewey and Simon Kinberg serving as executive producers.

Not exactly a mid-credits scene, but a touching retrospective featurette spotlighting some fun behind-the-scenes moments from the Marvel/Fox films, including X-Men, Daredevil, Blade, Fantastic Four, and more. It's certainly a worthwhile highlight reel, especially for fans that grew up with those films, so just sit down and enjoy the emotional trip down memory lane.\n\nThen, after the credits wrap up, we're treated to the film's final moments...\n\nEarlier in the movie, upon arriving in the Void and engaging in their first fight, Deadpool and Wolverine find themselves face-to-face with a fiery figure from Marvel and Fox's past: the Human Torch, Johnny Storm, played by none other than original Fantastic Four actor Chris Evans, who returns to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the first time since Avengers: Endgame.\n\nIt's the first of many major cameos during the film's second act and arguably one of the most fun as we get to see Evans seamlessly step back into his fan-favorite part and partner up with Deadpool and Wolverine, although their team-up is short-lived as Deadpool somewhat inadvertently gets Johnny killed by Cassandra Nova after revealing - at length - some of the not-so-nice things Johnny had to say about her on the trip to her base.\n\nIn the film, it's left unclear whether Johnny actually said the things Deadpool claimed he did or whether Wade, at his most Deadpool, was up to his usual half-brained shenanigans that resulted in his new friend getting flayed alive.\n\nFast forward to the post-credits and we get a resolution to the fantastic joke as we watch Deadpool make a return trip to the TVA, where he decides to play some never-before-seen footage from their trip to Cassandra's base - and, sure enough, Johnny did say everything Wade claimed he did, so maybe he wasn't 100% at fault for the Torch flaming out... just maybe.\n\nRegardless, it's well worth the wait as we get to see Chris Evans recite easily the most vulgar monologue he's ever been given in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and a pretty perfect bookend to the MCU's most wild adventure yet.\n\nIn our review, we said, \"Deadpool & Wolverine is the ultimate Marvel movie, a non-stop blockbuster entertainer with a heart of red and gold. Ryan Reynolds is truly Marvel Jesus, breathing new life into the MCU and resurrecting the X-Man himself Hugh Jackman for one of the most wildly enjoyable comic book movies ever, with both delivering all-time performances that will go down in the CBM history books. Don't head to the theater expecting answers about the future of the X-Men in the MCU or any of the larger ramifications on the Sacred Timeline, just walk in expecting a good time with Deadpool and Wolverine - maybe grab a popcorn bucket - and, trust me, you'll walk out extremely happy.\"", "source": {"uri": "comicbookmovie.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comic Book Movie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.ibb.co/JzJcjKt/TDW-20105-R.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

As Disney CEO Bob Iger has vowed to pull back on some of Marvel's output, Deadpool & Wolverine is the only offering from the studio to head to the big screen this year.\n\nBut perhaps Ryan Reynolds' Merc with a Mouth is just the character to burst into the MCU at this moment in time. IGN talked to Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige after watching the first 35 minutes of Deadpool & Wolverine last week, during which Deadpool himself directly comments on the perceived dip in quality the MCU has taken in the days after Avengers: Endgame. So of course, we had to ask: how does Feige feel about that discourse, now that they're addressing it right there in the film?\n\nBelow, IGN's Benny Watts talks to Feige about that, why Deadpool & Wolverine feels like a mid-phase reset, the R-rating, all that cocaine talk, and more.\n\nIGN: Deadpool & Wolverine almost like a mid-phase reset. So I want to ask, why are Deadpool and Wolverine the characters to do it?\n\nKevin Feige: I hadn't heard it put that way before - mid-phase reset. I like that. I think that's pretty cool, and I think a lot of that, like everyone else in life, comes down to timing. It is timing that Disney acquired Fox, that we got the rights to the characters, that we've had meetings with Ryan on and off, trying to figure out what would be the best storyline for a third Deadpool, for the first Deadpool within Marvel Studios. And the greatest bit of timing, as I'm sure you've heard, is when Hugh called Ryan and said \"I'd like to come back.\" Because if that call had come a year from now or three years before, I'm not sure - I mean, I am sure it wouldn't have been as much of a slam dunk as it was in the exact moment when he called, which was the exact same time we brought Shawn on board to direct and we were trying to crack the movie. And there were a lot of great elements that ended up in the movie people will see, but there was just something missing and we were about to say, let's slow down, retool, and figure out what was missing, when Hugh called and said, \"I'm missing.\"\n\nI've only seen the first 35 minutes, but there are jokes in the movie that reference a cultural conversation about the quality of the MCU post-Endgame, and it seems that this movie is willing to get involved in that dialogue. So I want to ask, how do you feel about the MCU's perceived quality and the particular fan perspective that things may have not lived up to the expectations?\n\nFeige: Well, I think when the expectations are \"biggest movie of all time,\" those are pretty lofty expectations. At least we were the biggest movie briefly, before Avatar was re-released. But they're high bars, and there's a dichotomy at Marvel Studios where we like being the underdog and we like exceeding expectations. But we also like setting the bar higher than the bar's ever been set before. Those are two things that are hard to keep navigating over the years.\n\nThe great thing about Deadpool is he'll just directly talk about all of it. And if you ever find yourself saying, \"It's okay if Deadpool makes fun of a lot of things, but don't make fun of me,\" you're not a cool guy. You're not a fun person. I've always said, \"Who does Deadpool make fun of the most? Ryan Reynolds.\" Deadpool makes fun of Ryan Reynolds all the time. So I think it is an honor that he now gets to poke fun at us and at Marvel.\n\nI think along those lines of where you find this getting made fun of, I'm interested in, were there any guidelines that you gave to the creative team to say, \"this is the line? We love it, this is great, but there is a limit on how far can you go\"?\n\nFeige: Shawn and Ryan know what that line is, know inherently what that line is. Ryan probably more than anyone because even though there's the F-bombs, and even though there's blood spurting with claws and katanas, there is a core decency and heart to the movie and to the characters. Ryan is the great arbiter of that.\n\nHe put it very well at one point saying, \"Deadpool always punches up. You can punch up as much as you want. Never punch down.\" He's never mean-spirited or mean-hearted, because that's not funny. So actually, he knows where that line is.\n\nThere really wasn't anything that we had to step in and go, \"Now you've gone too far. The studio is locking down.\" There was a comment I had made at one point that I thought the cocaine jokes in the first few Deadpool movies were sort of old or felt like some sort of old '70s drug movie. It seemed dated to me. Ryan of course took that and reinterpreted it into \"studio mandate, no cocaine,\" and turned it into fresh, funny cocaine jokes.\n\nI've never talked about cocaine as much in my entire life as I have in this junket, so I appreciate it. You didn't bring it up. I brought it up. I know.\n\nShawn has said that Deadpool & Wolverine isn't part of any MCU phase that he's aware of. Does this mean that MCU films don't always have to be a part of the \"phases\" structure? Is the MCU phasing out phases?\n\nFeige: Phasing out phases? No, I mean phases have always simply been the point in time in which the project's made, and this movie is very much, as you've already referenced with Deadpool discussing the current state of the MCU, very much of its time of where we are in the phases. So I would say it's in there, but that's sort of besides the point when it comes to Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nWhat are the challenges of keeping the audience invested in characters when they can now be recast, die, reborn due to the multiverse? This is obviously a big thing in the comics, but general movie audiences can respond differently. Is that something you guys take into consideration?\n\nFeige: Well, I think the only thing we take into consideration is the story we're telling and the story we're telling in the moment. What's great about these characters in 85 years of Marvel comic history is they do go on, the characters do continue, like all great mythological characters continue. They evolve and they change.\n\nPart of what you will see in Deadpool & Wolverine is how Hugh, as this character, has changed and evolved. And some of that is based on the time we're in. Some of that is based on fictional narratives of timelines and time variance authorities. All of that is simply fun storytelling tools to get a couple of great characters that you've always wanted to see together, together in a way that honors the past, but just as importantly sets up the future.\n\nWhen you saw it, where was that point of excitement of seeing how this is this installment in the MCU and what audiences are about to say? Where was that excitement built from when you watch this film?\n\nFeige: I always love it when disparate elements of our storylines come together. So of course Deadpool and Wolverine coming together, but there are surprises throughout the movie that I think are amazing to see up on screen and to see certain combinations up on screen.\n\nEven Wolverine wearing a TVA jacket, I find fun and exciting in the way that we can combine these storylines into something that ultimately is a pure story about these two individuals and the relationship that they have, and the cathartic arc that they take together over the course of the movie. Everything else is fun Easter eggs for people who want to pay attention to such things. Like me.\n\nI want to ask about the R-rating on this film. This isn't being marketed as an R-rated film. The marketing is to a broad audience. Do you think R-rated films now, the actual rating is almost arbitrary? It's the story that's the most important thing?\n\nFeige: I think the story has always been the most important thing and I think the rating system is to give parents and audiences an indication of what can be expected. But everybody knows there's a huge range of PG movies, PG-13 movies, R movies. It is definitely an R movie with language and blood.\n\nBut I've said it is the sweetest, most wholesome R-rated movie, with characters who essentially can't be hurt because of their healing factors. So it is a very sweet movie that I think people will make their own decisions on who they want to bring with them to the movie.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_stedman@ign.com", "name": "Alex Stedman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IGN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvels", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Marvels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Iger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Katana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_mythology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greek mythology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/kevinfieged-w-blogroll-1721775537463.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Joe Villain Sets Up Cobra's Deep-Space War Against the Transformers\n\nSummary\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine get futuristic makeovers in \"Weapon X-Traction,\" exploring exaggerated versions of the heroes in 2099, 3099, and 4099. The 2099 versions pay tribute to the cyberpunk Marvel imprint of the '90s, featuring dark and extreme designs for the iconic characters. \"Weapon X-Traction\" combines humor and homage as Deadpool and Wolverine navigate the multiverse in this eight-part storyline, promising more fun ahead.\n\nWarning! Spoilers for Weapon X-Traction Part 2 ahead!\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine are tearing up the summer box office, and to celebrate the occasion, Marvel Comics is giving the two heroes all-new costumes that pay homage to the extreme '90s that gave birth to the Merc with the Mouth. The new looks arrive in \"Weapon X-Traction,\" which is being run as a back-up story in a host of different titles over the summer.\n\nAppearing as a back-up story in Captain America #11, the second part of \"Weapon X-Traction\" sees Deadpool and Wolverine pulled into the multiverse of possibilities, which leads Wade to speculate on future versions of himself and Logan.\n\nReaders first get a glimpse at the 2099 versions of Deadpool and Wolverine, a cyberpunk look that Wade describes as \"polymers and smelly leather.\" Not willing to stop there, Deadpool speculates what he and Wolverine would look like in 3099 and 4099, as the two heroes become less recognizable and more abstract, with Deadpool becoming a sentient collection of guns and Wolverine is turned into a torso with claws.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Get a Glimpse of the Future in \"Weapon X-Traction\"\n\n\"Weapon X-Traction\" by Ryan North, Javier Garr\u00f3n, Edgar Delgado & Joe Sabino\n\nThe 2099 versions of Wolverine and Deadpool act as the perfect homage to the 2099 imprint from the 1990s, which took Marvel characters and refashioned them in a futuristic, cyberpunk setting where America became a police state ruled by corporations. The Marvel heroes of 2099 were thus a darker breed, rebels and outcasts fighting against a corrupt system, so the more \"extreme\" take on Wolverine and Deadpool is appropriate. Wolverine's laser claws and Deadpool's floating hoverboard are a nice touch, and very much in keeping with the design aesthetics seen in the 2099 comics of the time.\n\nThe 2099 version of Wolverine was recently revealed to be the Last Nova in the pages of Annihilation: 2099 #1, and Wade's daughter Warda Wilson was revealed to be the Deadpool of 2099 in 2016's Deadpool #6.\n\nThe subsequent versions of Deadpool and Wolverine in the years 3099 and 4099 also act as a humorous send-up of the whole idea of futuristic versions of superheroes. The 3099 version of both characters sees them morph fully into cyborgs, with Deadpool becoming an anime-inspired robot and Wolverine apparently having a robotic exoskeleton over his adamantium-laced skull. The 4099 iterations are even more ridiculous, highlighting how little thought can go into such futuristic versions of heroes beyond their most obvious characteristics.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Run Amok in the Multiverse This Summer\n\n\"Weapon X-Traction\" Runs Weekly Through August\n\nIt's a brief gag, but the future versions of Deadpool and Wolverine seen in \"Weapon X-Traction\" wind up being perfect as both a parody and homage to one of the most turbulent decades in American comics history. The 2099 setting remains popular with many Marvel fans, so there is always the possibility readers will get to see the futuristic version of both heroes again soon. With Deadpool and Wolverine on a mission to save the multiverse in the eight-part \"Weapon X-Traction\" storyline, hopefully fans can expect further, just as hilarious variations on both characters in the weeks to come.\n\nCaptain America #11 is on sale now from Marvel Comics.\n\nCaptain America #11 (2024)\n\nWriters: J.

Or is it? The great promise of bringing Ryan Reynolds' fourth wall-breaking Merc with a Mouth to the MCU is mostly fulfilled in Deadpool & Wolverine, the third Deadpool film and the first under the Marvel Studios banner. But this movie is less about bringing Deadpool and Wolverine into the same world as the Avengers than it is about saying goodbye to the 20th Century Fox era of superhero movies with all its superb highs and embarrassing lows. And that's not a totally bad thing.\n\nWe can't really say much more on the topic without getting into some serious spoilers... so let's talk about the ending of Deadpool & Wolverine and what it means for the MCU -- or rather, what it doesn't.\n\nMost of Deadpool & Wolverine find the titular mutants (played by Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman) trapped in the Void, the location at the end of time where everyone pruned by the Time Variance Authority is sent. First introduced in Loki, it's becomes a kind of Island of Misfit Toys for forgotten Marvel characters (ie every superhero or supervillain from the 20th Century Fox era).\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine meet characters from the Fox X-Men movies and other pre-MCU projects. They even encounter superheroes that never got their big-screen debut. The latter includes the movie's Big Bad, Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), Charles Xavier's evil twin who tried to strangle him in the womb, before she was banished to the Void by the TVA as a baby. She soon becomes the tyrannical ruler of the Void, gathering a following of fellow banished baddies like Pyro, Sabretooth, and Juggernaut. But after Pyro (Aaron Stanford) betrays her at the behest of rogue TVA agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew MacFadyen), Cassandra sets her eyes beyond the Void. She travels to Deadpool's world, Earth-10005, to take control of Mr. Paradox's Time Ripper, a machine that has the capability to immediately destroy an entire timeline. In her hands, it will destroy all of existence, except for the Void. Deadpool and Wolverine, who had been desperately trying to stop Mr. Paradox from using the Time Ripper to destroy Earth-10005, must fight through an army of psychotic Deadpool variants to stop Cassandra, before making the ultimate sacrifice to destroy the machine.\n\nTheir dual efforts work to destroy the machine, and Cassandra, seemingly at the cost of their own lives. But through the power of friendship (and their redoubled regenerative abilities), Deadpool and Wolverine manage to survive, just as the TVA arrives to put a stop to Mr. Paradox's scheme. From then on, it's happy ever after: this Wolverine variant opts to stay in Earth-10005 with Deadpool, and Deadpool persuades the TVA to let him bring Laura, aka X-23, back from the Void (though apparently none of his other Void teammates). But we never did find out why Thor was crying over Deadpool...\n\nDeadpool x Thor Forever\n\nOne of the handful of teases that Deadpool & Wolverine offers for future MCU crossovers is the glimpse that Mr. Paradox shows of Deadpool being cradled by a crying Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Will Deadpool somehow be mortally wounded in a future battle? Will he fight in Secret Wars, the big Avengers crossover event set to end the Multiverse Saga? It's too early to tell, though this brief scene clearly suggests as much.\n\nAnd with the film's introduction of anchor beings, which are the people whose existence keeps their timeline from falling apart, Deadpool & Wolverine is already setting the stage for the beginning of Secret Wars. But thankfully, this kind of Marvel lore-building is fairly minimal and limited to the first 40 minutes of the film. What matters is the rest of it, and how it bids goodbye to a formative, if tumultuous, era of superhero movies.\n\nThe Goodbye to Fox We Needed (Feat. a Very Deadpool Credits Scene)\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine dedicates most of its runtime (and cameos) to paying homage to the pre-MCU era of Marvel movies with a particular focus on 20th Century Fox, which acquired the rights to both the X-Men and the Fantastic Four. To that end, we see characters from films like Blade, Daredevil, Elektra, Fantastic Four, the X-Men movies, and of course, Logan. While the latter gets a questionable homage via an opening scene that literally uses Logan's skeleton to bash in the heads of TVA agents, the rest of the homages range from loving to tongue-in-cheek -- the Sabretooth and Logan face-off is given appropriate hype, while Blade (Wesley Snipes) and Elektra (Jennifer Garner) get to show off how badass they still are. And the very meta appearance of Chris Evans as Johnny Storm -- which gets expanded in a foul-mouthed post-credits scene -- is the biggest sign that this is a film about looking back, not looking forward.\n\nIt's all cemented during the credits roll, when Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" plays over scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from all the Fox movies, good and bad (good for them, trying to make X-Men: Apocalypse appear decent). It's Marvel's own In Memoriam for the 20th Century chapter, a sweet and loving gesture to a series of films that did so much to launch the modern superhero era and create the foundation upon which the MCU stands today.

He's a foul-mouthed hero cursed with immortality and humor curated explicitly for a teenage boy. He's already gotten two movies from 20th Century Fox. After Disney merged with the company, it absorbed the rights to superheroes like the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and, of course, Deadpool. The merger means that the motor-mouthed antihero can officially make his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Based on the movie's trailer, Deadpool has been looking forward to it.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine, out July 26, has been in the works for a while, and a lot is riding on this film. Marvel is entering a new era, trying to figure out how to get moviegoers back to the theaters in droves, and constantly shuffling their meticulously planned timeline. With the amount of backstory Deadpool and Wolverine have in the comics and their previous movie appearances, there is more than enough material to pull from.\n\nDeadpool has appeared in two prior movies, and Wolverine has been integral to several X-Men movies. Here's everything you need to know about Deadpool, Wolverine, and where they fit in the MCU before watching Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nMarvel has been in sort of a slump and is currently pulling its way out. Its last three films, released last year, were Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantummania, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and The Marvels -- and all required the viewer to have watched other Marvel projects to understand the full context. The same goes for Deadpool & Wolverine. In the movie, Deadpool is summoned by the Time Variance Authority when a man named Paradox (played by Matthew Macfadyen) takes him to a room and tells him he has a purpose, before sending him on a mission (this is when Deadpool adopts the nickname he gives to himself, Marvel Jesus).\n\nThe Time Variance Authority are the keepers of the Sacred Timeline -- it is precisely what it sounds like -- and they keep alternate timelines from forming and \"pruning\" variants. When a variant is pruned, we learn in Loki, they don't die -- they get sent to the Void. In Loki, this is where the titular character meets his variants: Kid Loki, Classic Loki, Boastful Loki, Alligator Loki, etc. (This will come into play in Deadpool & Wolverine). However, variants are not the only thing that exists in the Void. One of the guardians of the Void is Alioth, a giant, scary cloud monster that has consumed many of the variants exiled to this desolate land.\n\nThe Deadpool movies provide the origin story for how the world became blessed with this quick-witted, vulgar guy. But before that, we must note that Deadpool was not Reynolds's first brush with Marvel, or his first time playing the character. In the 2009 film X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Reynolds played Deadpool. However, his mouth was taped shut, and fans hated it, so he committed to doing the hero justice with standalone movies.\n\nThe revamped version of Deadpool got his first standalone movie in 2016. Wade Wilson falls in love with a woman named Vanessa, but shortly after proposing to her, he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He gets an opportunity to undergo an experimental treatment that would allow him to activate any mutant genes in his system via the Weapon X project. With the treatment, he becomes deformed after being tortured by the lead scientist on the project named Ajax (but his real name is Francis). Still, he gains healing and regenerative abilities, just like Wolverine.\n\nOnce he assumes the role of Deadpool, Wade ventures off to find the man who tortured him to get revenge. He almost does but is stopped by Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, who try to get him to join the X-Men, but Deadpool declines. At the end of the movie, he kills Ajax and reconciles with Vanessa.\n\nIn the second movie, Deadpool is seen hard at work taking out mob bosses and such. One of those groups then finds out where he lives and kills Vanessa. This leads Deadpool to try and die by suicide, but his remains are found by Colossus, who again tries to make him a member of the X-Men. This time, Deadpool agrees. While responding to a call at a mutant orphanage, Deadpool encounters a mutant named Russell Collins, aka Firefist. Wade realizes that a staff member is abusing Firefist and kills them, leading him and Firefist to be detained and sent to the Ice Box. They wear collars that suppress their powers, meaning they are mere mortals and can be killed.\n\nA time-traveling mutant named Cable tries to kill Russell, but Deadpool stops it and breaks out with Cable. He does feel for Russell and organizes a team called the X-Force to break him free -- but they all die except for Deadpool and a character named Domino (played by Zazie Beets). Russell escapes and frees Juggernaut, who agrees to help him kill the abusive headmaster of the orphanage. Cable tells Deadpool that if Russell kills the headmaster, he becomes a serial killer who kills Cable's family. Wade agrees to help Cable stop him, but only if he's given a chance to talk to Russell, and Cable obliges. When they finally get to Russell, though, Deadpool cannot convince him, and Cable fires a shot at Russell, but Deadpool jumps in front of it wearing the power-suppressing collar and dies. Cable is surprised by his decision to save Russell, reverses time, and puts a Skee ball token that Vanessa left behind after she died where the bullet eventually hits Wade, saving his life, and a taxi driver kills the headmaster.\n\nDeadpool then uses Cable's time travel device to travel back in time and saves Vanessa before she's shot.\n\nWith Wolverine, there's a lot of ground to cover. The first time we are introduced to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is in the 2000 film X-Men, which also brings us Patrick Stewer's Professor Charles Xavier, Ian McKellen's Magneto, Halle Berry's Storm, and James Marsden's Cyclops -- and Sabertooth, which will become important later in the timeline. The original X-Men sees Magneto trying to use Rogue's powers to turn the world's leaders into mutants and bring about a wider acceptance of mutants. The X-Men subdue him, and Logan joins the \"family.\"\n\nIn the second X-Men film, X2, Logan attempts to learn more about his past. Colonel William Stryker was the man who coated his skeleton in adamantium, the fictional metal. All you need to know is that the X-Men defeat Stryker after he tries to kill every mutant on Earth. A flood destroys his lab, and Jean Grey (the woman Cyclops and Wolverine are secretly in love with) is killed as she helps the X-Men escape.\n\nThe third movie sees Professor Xavier killed by a Jean Grey lookalike called the Phoenix, leading Wolverine to become the leader of the X-Men. The Phoenix is recruited by Magneto, who is unable to harness her powers, and she goes rogue, meaning that Wolverine is the only person who can kill her. So, Wolverine kills the love of his life or a version of her.\n\nWe won't get into the three prequels because they don't mean much for Deadpool & Wolverine. But you need to know what happens in the 2017 movie Logan. There are few mutants in this movie due to a mutant apocalypse, and many of the X-Men are dead. Logan encounters a young girl named Laura with claws like his after Logan's blood was used to create her. The most crucial part of this movie is that Logan's healing abilities are weakened, and he fights his clone, who kills him for good. Jackman did announce that he was not interested in reviving Logan or Wolverine (let the man do his Broadway shows!), but Reynolds was able to get him to don the claws once more for Deadpool & Wolverine.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "moises_mendez_ii@time.com", "name": "Moises Mendez Ii", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Marvel lovers have been eager to find out who would be popping up in the new film, and one major mystery has been the identity of Lady Deadpool AKA Ladypool. Earlier this week, folks got a look at the character in the film's final trailer, and speculation continued about her identity. Theories ranged from Taylor Swift to Ryan Reynolds in a wig, and we finally have the answer. Warning: Deadpool & Wolverine spoilers ahead... One of the prevailing theories about Ladypool was that she was being played by Reynolds' real-life wife, Blake Lively, Turns out, that guess proved to be correct. However, things didn't play out quite as people had assumed.\n\nEver since fans started guessing the identity of Lady Deadpool, they figured the character would be unmasked in the film. However, most of the Deadpool Variants kept their masks on during their appearance. While you can clearly hear Lively's voice, you never actually see her face. Turns out, she's not the only big name to appear as an alternate Deadpool. Other stars in the bunch included Matthew McConaughey as Cowboy Deadpool and Nathan Fillion as Headpool. Just like Lively, their faces are never shown in the film.\n\nRyan Reynolds Addresses Working with Blake Lively:\n\nComicBook had the chance to chat with Reynolds alongside Hugh Jackman and Deadpool & Wolverine director Shawn Levy, and while the trio wasn't sharing any spoilers, Reynolds did have a hilarious answer when asked what it would be like to hypothetically work with Lively in a Marvel project.\n\n\"She's not half the friend that Hugh is,\" Reynolds said incredibly seriously, causing Jackman and Levy to laugh. \"Hey, we haven't even started rolling yet,\" he joked. \"I'll get all performative in a second.\"\n\nJackman then pointed out that his relationship with Reynolds predates Reynolds' relationship with Lively.\n\n\"I would love to ... You know, in the old days, they all got to work together, hanging out,\" Reynolds explained. \"We got Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn ... That'd be nice, I'd love to work with Blake.\"\n\nYou can watch the interview at the top of the page.\n\nWhat Is Deadpool & Wolverine About?\n\nIn Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) will change the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The film also stars Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox, and Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, with the return of Deadpool alums Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as Piotr Rasputin/Colossus, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Rob Delaney as Peter, and Lewis Tan as Shatterstar. Aaron Stanford is returning as Pyro from the X-Men film series, with Jennifer Garner rumored to return as Elektra Natchios.\n\nKevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy and Lauren Shuler Donner produce with Louis D'Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, George Dewey and Simon Kinberg serving as executive producers.

Deadpool & Wolverine launches in 2024 as the only MCU movie of the year, but according to the people behind it, it shouldn't be considered part of Marvel's phase structure even if technically it is a part of Phase 5.\n\nIn a recent interview with IGN, director Shawn Levy said Deadpool & Wolverine is \"not part of any phase that I know of\" when asked if the movie acts as a \"full stop\" for the two superhero characters, or whether they will appear in more MCU projects down the line.\n\nHere's Levy's comment in full:\n\n\"I love these characters so much. I love these performers, these actors, these stars, these icons so much. I don't know what the future holds. I will say this, we very intentionally did not want to make a Marvel movie that is a commercial or a setup for the next Marvel movie. So we are not part of any phase that I know of. We acknowledge the antecedents, we respect the legacy that we're inheriting, but our goal was to do a self-contained story. As to whether these characters move on from here, time will tell, but I'd sure love to see it and I'd also love to be a part of it.\"\n\nWe then put this to Feige himself in a follow-up interview, which you can read in full here. Feige responded to insist Marvel is sticking with the phase system and that Deadpool & Wolverine is a part of it, but the film shouldn't be thought of in this way.\n\n\"Phasing out phases? No, I mean phases have always simply been the point in time in which the project's made, and this movie is very much, as you've already referenced with Deadpool discussing the current state of the MCU, very much of its time of where we are in the phases,\" Feige told IGN.\n\n\"So I would say it's in there, but that's sort of beside the point when it comes to Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine occupies a unique spot in the MCU, then, which sparks obvious questions about whether or not the two characters are now set to appear in future superhero team-up movies. Could Deadpool and Wolverine join the X-Men and face-off against The Avengers at some point, perhaps? Maybe we'll find out more during Marvel's hotly anticipated panel at San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nIn the shorter term, MCU Phase 6 kicks off with 2025's The Fantastic Four movie, and is also set to include Blade, as well as two new Avengers movies.\n\nIGN's Deadpool & Wolverine review returned a 7/10.

One, he is a tough as nails, and the other, we relate to him. Well, not to his regenerative healing ability, but to his charming and funny personality. And there's nobody else better than Ryan Reynolds to play Wade Wilson, also known as Deadpool.\n\nIn fact, Ryan Reynolds is him.\n\nBut Deadpool & Wolverine, as the name suggests, isn't about Wade, nor is it about the second titular superhero, Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman. Perhaps the most interesting bit about the film is Jackman's return as the popular mutant, someone fans bid farewell to in 2017's Logan.\n\nHowever, Disney had other plans after acquiring Fox in 2019, which straight away gave them rights to the much-loved X-Men and Fantastic Four roster.\n\nSo, as Deadpool says in the film, Wolverine is sprung back into action at a very low point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). It is true, ever since Avengers: Endgame in 2019, Marvel has picked up the reputation of producing lacklustre films, milking the multiverse dry, and turning powerful characters into dysfunctional, needy beings.\n\nDeadpool is known for his satirical approach, giving audiences something to laugh about in the film. That's exactly what happens in Shawn Levy's Deadpool & Wolverine: digs after digs after digs. Reynolds is throwing jokes at Fox, then Disney, then Marvel, then DC (Marvel's arch-nemesis) -- it is almost like a roast special with the entire podium to Reynolds himself, and he guarantees a laugh throughout.\n\nThe superhero flick certainly lands its jokes right (with gasps and laughter heard across the cinema), but with its storyline and action, not so much.\n\nHere's a gist of the plot: Deadpool wants to matter, mainly to his lady love Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), and subsequently to his group of friends; he wants to save the world, and be an \"Avenger.\"\n\nHe doesn't really come across as the world-saving type, as we're told. But he wants to be, and so he tries. His universe faces the threat of extinction due to the death of an \"anchor-being,\" so he sets out to bring him back. Guess who? Yes, you guessed it right.\n\nThings go south and we see the pair-up of the century, the kind which requires nerds to bring out their \"special socks.\" Deadpool and Wolverine, with some allies of their own, are up against Cassandra Nova (Chuck Xavier's sister), played by Emma Corrin, and her mercenaries in The Void, a rip-off of the Mad Max world.\n\nThanks to the Time Variant Authority in MCU, the franchise can play with timelines and universes, and bring back favourite characters albeit different variants. That's what we see in Deadpool & Wolverine, a mix of fan-favourite X-Men characters who are now part of the Marvel roster.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "husain_rizvi@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Husain Rizvi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Corrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Corrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morena_Baccarin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morena Baccarin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mad Max"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=27b9589b-f260-5720-b35d-a6e64445229d&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.80697&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4588235294117646, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

That's pretty impressive, but if Ryan Reynolds had his way, the surprise would have been significantly bigger. In a guest appearance on Hot Ones, Reynolds revealed that they briefly considered marketing Deadpool & Wolverine as a totally different movie, with the idea being that audiences would turn out for a Reynolds/Jackman team-up...and get the ultimate team-up as a surprise. Per Reynolds, the ideal situation would have been for the movie to look terrible...right until the Marvel logo appeared and the crowd went wild.\n\nIt's a great idea, and would have been an impressive piece of performance art, but you can see a few flaws in the idea: first off, as soon as the movie premiered, somebody on social media would have blown the secret, so you basically would have spent all that extra money for a one-night gag. There's also the fact that Hollywood is struggling, and Disney likely wouldn't have wanted to sacrifice a lucrative opening night for the joke.\n\n\"I'm shocked that we managed to get through this without some of our biggest surprises, even hypothesized online,\" Reynolds said. \"The original idea with this movie was to shoot a fake movie called Alpha Cop, that was intentionally bad....It was about 2 guys that were sharing one brain, and together they make the perfect cop. The poster says Alpha Cop: two cops, one brain, all balls. And it was meant to be horrible. Like ten people in America would go to see this movie on opening weekend, and five minutes into the movie the Marvel logo would flip up and it would actually be Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nHonestly, part of us wishes we lived in that timeline, Maybe Deadpool and Wolverine can figure out a way to take us there.\n\nIn Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) will change the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The film also stars Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox, and Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, with the return of Deadpool alums Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as Piotr Rasputin/Colossus, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Rob Delaney as Peter, and Lewis Tan as Shatterstar. Aaron Stanford is returning as Pyro from the X-Men film series, with Jennifer Garner rumored to return as Elektra Natchios.\n\nKevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy and Lauren Shuler Donner produce with Louis D'Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, George Dewey and Simon Kinberg serving as executive producers.

That tension -- the fact that \"Deadpool\" has called out comic book movie tropes despite being, in fact, a comic book movie -- is somehow remedied in \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" which leans into its genre more than the franchise's first two movies.\n\nPerhaps this gives viewers more clarity on its intended audience. After all, someone who hates superhero films -- I'm looking at you, Scorsese -- isn't going to be won over because of a few self-deprecating jokes about lazy writing, budgets for A-list cameos and the overused \"superhero landing\" Reynolds' Deadpool regularly refers to.\n\nBut this time around, director Shawn Levy -- his first Marvel movie -- seems to have found a sweet spot. Levy is surely helped by the fact that the third film in the franchise has a bigger budget, more hype and, of course, a brooding, eventually shirtless, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine -- who has long been teased as someone Deadpool has, er, complicated feelings toward.\n\nThat anticipation makes their relationship, packed with hatred, fandom and homoeroticism, all the more enticing. Their fight scenes against each other are just as compelling as their moments of self-sacrificial partnership in the spirit of, you guessed it, saving the world(s).\n\nSpeaking of worlds, there is one important development in our own to be aware of ahead of time. The first two \"Deadpool\" films were distributed by 20th Century Fox, whose $71.3 billion acquisition by the Walt Disney Co. in 2019 opened the door for the franchise to join the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" takes full advantage of that vast playground, which began in 2008 with Robert Downey Jr.'s \"Iron Man\" and now includes more than 30 films and a host of television shows. The acquisition is also a recurring target of Deadpool's sarcasm throughout the movie.\n\nAlthough steeped in references and cameos that can feel a bit like inside baseball for the less devoted, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is easy enough to follow for the casual Marvel viewer, though it wouldn't hurt to have seen the first \"Deadpool\" and Jackman's 2017 \"Logan,\" a harbinger of the increasing appetite for R-rated superhero violence. The Disney+ series \"Loki\" also gives helpful context, though is by no means a must watch, on the Time Variance Authority, which polices multiverse timelines to avoid \"incursions,\" or the catastrophic colliding of universes.\n\nA defining feature of \"Deadpool\" has been its R rating and hyper violent action scenes. Whether thanks to more money, Levy's direction or some combination of the two, these scenes are much more visually appealing.\n\nBut \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" does succumb to some of the deus ex machina writing that so often plagues superhero movies. Wade Wilson's (the real identity of Deadpool) relationship with his ex (?) Vanessa is particularly underdeveloped -- though it's possible that ambiguity is a metaphor for Deadpool's future within the MCU.\n\nThe plot feels aimless at points toward the end. One cameo-saturated battle scene in particular is resolved in a way that leaves its audience wanting after spending quite a bit of time building tension around it. While there are a few impressive stars who make an appearance, audiences may be disappointed by the amount of MCU characters referenced who don't make it in.\n\nThe bloody but comedic final fight scene, however, is enough to perk viewers back up for the last act, solidifying the film's identity as a fun, generally well-made summer movie.\n\nThe sole MCU release of 2024, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" proves it's not necessarily the source material that's causing so-called superhero fatigue. It also suggests, in light of Marvel's move to scale back production following a pandemic and historic Hollywood strikes, that increased attention given to making a movie will ultimately help the final product.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" a Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence and language throughout, gore and sexual references. Running time: 127 minutes. Two and a half out of four stars.", "source": {"uri": "sentinelcolorado.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sentinel Colorado"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trope (literature)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Downey Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teams_and_organizations_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teams and organizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Other_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Other Media", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sentinelcolorado.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24204612438994.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Every Marvel fan's dream of witnessing Wade and Logan team up onscreen has reached its peak with the release of 'Deadpool & Wolverine'.\n\nIn the virtual press conference held earlier this week, Marvel President and Chief Creative Officer Kevin Feige confirmed that 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is 'just the beginning' for mutants within the MCU.He spoke about the possibility of future projects now more mutants are coming.\n\n\"It's just the beginning. I have said that mutants are coming, and it all starts with this movie. I can't wait for people to see what [Deadpool and Wolverine] has in store and know that this is the beginning of mutants finally arriving into the MCU,\" Kevin said.\n\nGiven that MCU has gone through turbulent times following the humongous success of 'Avengers: Endgame' in 2019, the recent release is crucial. As 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is MCU's first R-rated movie, there were also conversations around it. Kevin Feige explained why 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is a significant film for the ever-expanding Marvel franchise, and whether it marks a 'before and after' moment for the saga.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine - Official Trailer\n\n\"Well, I think every movie is important, but the most important thing is a great movie, and Shawn and Ryan and Hugh and this whole team have made a great movie, so there's nothing better for a cinematic universe than a great movie coming out. The before and after -- I mean, I think a lot of people talk about the R rating. Is every movie going to be R-rated after this? Of course not, but I hope every movie after this embraces its tonality the way 'Deadpool' does and the way this team was able to do on 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' And also, clearly now that we have the characters from the 'X-Men' world and the mutants that we haven't had access to before, I think this is the beginning of that. Everything post-'Deadpool & Wolverine' will be the mutant era coming into the MCU,\" he said.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

By now you realize that Wade Wilson and Logan are on a quest to save Deadpool's reality from being pruned by a rogue arm of the Time Variance Authority. This leads to the duo being sent into The Void, where they encounter, cast Cassandra Nova and her band of forgotten Fox universe characters. Matthew McFadyen's Mr. Paradox once the TVA to get back to pruning timelines and has developed a Time Ripper device to speed up the process. Once Cassandra nova discovers this machine, she decides to use it to eradicate not only Deadpool's timeline, but all the others, so she can rule across an infinite void.\n\nTo counteract this, Deadpool & Wolverine figure out that running different Anti-matter and Dark matter currents through the machine will short circuit it at the cost of the person's life who chooses to step in as the conduit between the energy streams. Of course, Deadpool & Wolverine discover that running the current through two people reverses the machine and obliterates Cassandra Nova. Hunter B-15 from Loki informs to duo that Deadpool's home reality has been saved and is regenerating itself through their actions.\n\nWith no home to return to, the version of Logan, that Wade recruited on this quest decides to stick around in the Fox X-Men universe. He's reunited with the version of X-23 we meet in the void and things look fine for now. Hunter B-15 told the duo to keep themselves ready because they could be needed again. Marvel has not yet revealed, whether or not Ryan Reynolds or Hugh Jackman will be back for Avengers 5 or Avengers: Secret Wars. But, it seems like a safe, bet that both Deadpool and wolverine will make their grand return in another Marvel team-up.\n\nWho Will Be In Avengers 5?\n\nSpeaking of Avengers 5, Kevin Feige was recently asked about the roster size for the Marvel crossover. He told io9 that every single hero you've met through Phase 4 and 5 of the MCU won't be in Avengers 5. Feige was quick to say that it doesn't mean they're gone for good, but you can expect some hard decisions when it comes to the full roster when it's revealed..\n\n\"I rarely speak in absolutes like that, right?\" Feige said when asked who would make the cut. \"The notion of never ever seeing somebody again, we've got Tim Blake Nelson in a movie coming up next year, right? So I never talk in absolutes like that. But the truth is, you know, we're going to tell a story in these Avengers movies, and there won't be room for 100,000 characters in it. So choices will have to be made, that's for sure. But that doesn't mean you won't ever see anybody ever again.\"\n\nIn Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) will change the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The film also stars Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox, and Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, with the return of Deadpool alums Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as Piotr Rasputin/Colossus, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Rob Delaney as Peter, and Lewis Tan as Shatterstar. Aaron Stanford is returning as Pyro from the X-Men film series, with Jennifer Garner rumored to return as Elektra Natchios.\n\nKevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy and Lauren Shuler Donner produce with Louis D'Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, George Dewey and Simon Kinberg serving as executive producers. Deadpool & Wolverine is written by Ryan Reynolds & Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick & Zeb Wells & Shawn Levy.

Read on to find out whom to expect on the big screen\n\nThe much-awaited movie 'Deadpool & Wolverine' is all set to hit the theatres worldwide on July 26. Director Shawn Levy has earlier said that the movie has a 'lot of cameos' that will have the fans excited. And true to his words, the Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman-starrer Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film has a host of cameos which will keep you on the edge of your seats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHere are the cameos you can expect on the big screen:\n\nChris Evans as Johnny Storm/Human Torch\"\n\nWhat was probably one of the most guarded and unexpected cameos was one featuring Chris Evans. Deadpool and Wolverine meet him in The Void. Deadpool assumes it is Captain America as his costume is covered in the first scene. Later, we along with Wade Wilson (Deadpool) discover that Evans has returned to play Johnny Storms aka Human Torch from Fantastic Four. He has a limited screen-time in the movie but wait for the post-credit to catch Evans at his best.\n\nHenry Cavill as Wolverine variant :\n\nDeadpool's reaction to Henry as a Wolverine variant is exactly how the audiences reacted at a screening of a film. Deadpool is out on a hunt in various timelines looking for the right Wolverine when in one timeline Wolverine is played by Henry Cavill who is otherwise known or his role as Superman.\n\nAvengers (on-screen) :\n\nWell, not technically a cameo but some members of the Avengers are mentioned and displayed on a screen when Deadpool talks to TVA agent Paradox.\n\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan:\n\nDeadpool gets interviewed in the Sacred Timeline by Happy Hogan to join the Avengers. However, Happy is not too impressed by Deadpool's wit and temperament especially when he constantly demands to wait for 'the man'.\n\nTyler Mane as Sabretooth:\n\nWolverine's half-brother Sabretooth makes a special appearance in The Void. Deadpool makes a huge deal out of it calling it the fight that fans have been waiting for decades. Head to the theatres to find out how that fight ends and gives Deadpool the perfect monologue moment.\n\nBlake Lively as Lady Deadpool:\n\nYes, it's Blake. In one of the scenes, Ryan Reynolds mentions Blake but that is not her only presence in the movie. The makers had teased a Lady Deadpool in one of the trailers of the film. While the film does not unmask Lady Deadpool, we learn that it was indeed Blake underneath the suit as she has been credited for the role.\n\nMatthew McConaughey as Cowboy Deadpool:\n\nEven though he has just one proper line, you would recognise him underneath that suit. The credits also confirm the same.\n\nDafne Keen as X-23/Laura:\n\nIf Logan is back, so is X-23 or Laura. X-23 is a feisty 11-year-old who inherits Logan's claws and regenerative capabilities. She plays an important cameo reaffirming the good in the Wolverine.\n\nChanning Tatum as Gambit:\n\nThe wildly underrated X-Men member Remy LeBeau aka Gambit makes a stylish entry when Deadpool and Wolverine reach a point where they are quite clueless of their situation.\n\nWesley Snipes as Blade:\n\nWesley Snipes entry as Blade is sure to bring in a lot of cheer, hooting and applause. He effortlessly plays the half-human, half-vampire and is joined by Elektra, Gambit, and X-23 and help Deadpool & Wolverine to get out of The Void.\n\nJennifer Garner as Elektra:\n\nWhile this is not exactly a surprise as Garner's return as Elektra was announced earlier this year, her entry sure did leave the audience happy. She, too, forms the part of the group of forgotten heroes who help the two main leads of the film when they need it the most.\n\nStan Lee:\n\nNo Marvel movie is complete without the presence of Stan Lee. In climax fight, don't forget to give a glance at the bus bill board.\n\nSpecial mention:\n\nRyan Reynolds as Nicepool: The void has a Nicepool who believes in kindness and has long, silky hair and is a self-proclaimed feminist. However, Deadpool is not a fan of the kindness he displays and the climax of the movie is evidence of his emotions towards Nicepool.", "source": {"uri": "mid-day.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-day"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavill", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cavill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Favreau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Mane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Mane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Snipes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Snipes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channing Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Lee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dafne_Keen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dafne Keen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/jul/DW-cameos_d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-26", "textStart": 235, "textEnd": 242}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The premiere of \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" marks the highly anticipated return of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and his encounter with the irreverent Deadpool, played by Ryan Reynolds. This duo promises an explosive combination of action, humor, and surprises.\n\nThe chemistry between these two iconic characters is one of the main attractions that has kept fans excited since the movie was announced, the latest in the Marvel Universe.\n\nRegarding this film, the last major release of the summer, we share information that answers some of the most frequently searched questions on Google.\n\nThe movie officially premieres this Thursday, July 25th, with preview screenings scheduled for Wednesday, July 24th.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" has a confirmed runtime of two hours and seven minutes, making it the longest Deadpool movie to date.\n\nThis extended duration allows for a deeper exploration of the multiverse and the inclusion of Wolverine as Deadpool's partner, which has been one of the most celebrated decisions by fans.\n\nPost-credits scenes have become a tradition in Marvel movies, generating expectations and speculation among fans regarding upcoming installments. \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is no exception, and rumors about the content of these scenes have flooded social media.\n\nTo the question of whether this film, directed by Shawn Levy, has post-credits scenes, the answer is: YES. Don't get up from your seat once it ends; wait patiently until the very end as there are two post-credits scenes.\n\nWe won't spoil anything, but we will say that it's worth staying in your seat.\n\nAnother aspect that excites Deadpool fans is the movie's soundtrack. Marvel Studios has revealed the official song list, featuring both classics and contemporary hits.\n\nHighlighted in this list is \"Like a Prayer\" by Madonna, a song included in the soundtrack thanks to Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman personally meeting with the singer to request her permission.\n\nHere is the list of songs that are part of the soundtrack of Marvel's latest movie:", "source": {"uri": "merca20.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Merca2.0 Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laura_islas@merca20.com", "name": "Laura Islas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Like_a_Prayer_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Like a Prayer (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://files.merca20.com/uploads/2024/07/deadpool-wolverine-movie.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 770, "textEnd": 779}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 830, "textEnd": 839}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Reynolds has played Deadpool since he first appeared in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine where there was precious little costume to hide behind for the actor. However, since starring in his own movies, and now appearing in the MCU, the Deadpool costume is a full bodysuit that covers his entire body.\n\nReynolds was in his late 40s while filming Deadpool & Wolverine, which is normally when most people struggle to stay in shape. However, as an actor, Reynolds is accustomed to maintaining his health and staying in good shape for work, but his ability to perform stunts like he used to is likely impacted by his age. While the suit makes it easy for Reynolds to tag in a stunt double for tougher action scenes, it appears that Reynolds was still keen to push himself to the limits.\n\nRyan Reynolds Is In The Deadpool Suit A Lot\n\nReynolds Still Looks Great In The Suit\n\nClose\n\nIt's no secret that Ryan Reynolds absolutely loves his Deadpool suit. In several interviews and marketing outside of filming, Reynolds dons the suit that has also been referred to as a \"big red body condom.\" It may be tight and form fitting, but Reynolds has been vocal about how important it is for him to wear the suit and still show up for the performance. In a recent interview where Ryan, Hugh Jackman, and director Shawn Levy sat down to discuss Deadpool & Wolverine, the director offered high praise to Reynolds for his ability to perform in the suit.\n\nWhile an actor's greatest asset could be their face, and their ability to express emotion with their dialogue and expressions, Reynolds has a gift for delivering emotion and range even with his face covered. Specifically, using just his voice and physicality, Reynolds is able to get the desired results and perform. Director Shawn Levy is clearly in awe of this gift, and had Ryan chosen to rely on a stunt double for most of his scenes, his performance could have been lost, leading to a less refined finished project.\n\nThere Are Also Stunt Doubles In The Deadpool Suit\n\nRyan Reynolds Doesn't Do It Alone\n\nClose\n\nHowever, there are still moments where the actor may not have the necessary training, or the stunt is simply too dangerous. In those moments, Reynolds is not averse to handing over control to someone who is more qualified, and specifically trained to perform those stunts. At present, the specific stunt double or doubles who appeared as Deadpool have not been named as appearing in that role, but Deadpool & Wolverine has a long list of stunt doubles who were cast and not tied to one particular character.\n\nStunt Doubles With Unspecified Roles In Deadpool & Wolverine\n\nKaranja Augostos\n\nJames Cox\n\nRick English\n\nJames Harris\n\nErol Ismail\n\nJonny James\n\nAntonio Oliveira\n\nInterestingly, none of the actors who previously appeared as Ryan Reynolds stunt double in a Deadpool movie have returned to the role. In the first film, Justin Eaton worked as the mocap stunt double for Reynolds, while Will Erichson and Alex Kyshkovych shared the work as Reynolds' stunt double. In Deadpool 2, Leif Havdale, Tom McComas, and Jackson Spidell each worked as stunt doubles for Reynolds druing the project. Kyshkovych also returned for Deadpool & Wolverine, although he was hired as a fight coordinator rather than a stunt double.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine\n\nR\n\nAction\n\nSci-Fi\n\nComedy\n\nSuperhero\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth.

Some returning Marvel actors were previously confirmed such as Jennifer Garner as Elektra and Aaron Stanford as Pyro. Marvel Studios even revealed a couple of big names within a week of the movie's release, including Dafne Keen as Laura/X-23. However, there were still plenty of surprises along the way. If you haven't seen Deadpool & Wolverine and don't want any spoilers, be warned, because this is a full list of the movie's biggest cameos...\n\nJust in case the curiosity got the better of you, but you're not fully committed to being spoiled, we'll kick things off with a small appearance that was already shown in the Deadpool & Wolverine trailers...\n\nChris Hemsworth as Thor\n\nWhile you do spot Chris Hemsworth's Thor on a video screen at the TVA in Deadpool & Wolverine, it's just archival footage from Thor: The Dark World. Thor is crying and holding Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), who has taken the place of Loki (Tom Hiddleston). While this isn't exactly a mind-blowing cameo, it's still pretty cool to see Deadpool interacting with Thor in any capacity on the big screen. While not much came of the moment in the film, it felt like they were setting something up for the future, especially since Deadpool referenced Thor crying multiple times throughout the threequel. Could Deadpool and Thor team up in Avengers 5 (formally Avengers: The Kang Dynasty)?\n\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan\n\nNow that we've warmed you up with a non-spoiler appearance, it's time to share the first big surprise of the film: Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau). One of the movie's first scenes sees Deadpool visiting Happy's office looking for a spot on the Avengers team. The timestamp shows that the interaction happened shortly before Thanos' snap, and there are lots of easter eggs in Happy's office ranging from various Iron Man helmets to the early mock-up of Cap's shield. You can even see the iconic photo of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Peter Parker (Tom Holland). However, Holland's face is hidden, presumably because Marvel Studios only gets so many chances to use the character. During the scene, there's also a joke about how Downey Jr. does not do cameos anymore, so don't expect to see his name on this list.\n\nHulk\n\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool travels the multiverse looking for a suitable Wolverine to help him save his universe, and he stumbles upon one version of the mutant fighting Hulk. Not only was Hulk briefly seen, but the moment is a special nod to The Incredible Hulk #181, the 1974 comic that featured the first appearance of Wolverine. Needless to say, this Wolverine couldn't help Deadpool because he was a little busy getting his butt whooped.\n\nHenry Cavill as Wolverine\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Henry Cavill AKA Superman has finally made his Marvel debut. There have been many fan casts for the next Wolverine in recent years, and Cavil's name has been one that often pops up online alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Taron Edgerton. During Deadpool's quest to find a Wolverine, he encounters a Variant played by Cavill. However, don't get your hopes up for more Cavill as Logan in the MCU. This was likely a one-off cameo to appease fan-casters, much like John Krasinski as Reed Richards in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.\n\nChris Evans as Johnny Storm\n\nCap is back... not! When Deadpool and Wolverine get sent to The Void, they encounter a character played by Evans, and Deadpool assumes it's Cap. The Merc with the Mouth gears up for him to say his iconic \"Avengers Assemble\" line only for him to drop a \"Flame On\" instead. That's right, Evans is back as Johnny Storm! The actor played the Human Torch in Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007). While fans have joked about Evans playing the character in the MCU, it was truly a surprise to see him rocking the blue bodysuit once again.\n\nSabretooth and Toad\n\nMagneto's villainous sidekicks from X-Men (2000), Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and Toad (Ray Park) are both back, and this time they're serving Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) in The Void. While the duo were previously confirmed to be in the film, it was still pretty cool to see them back in action after nearly 25 years. Unfortunately, Ian McKellen's Magneto was not featured in the movie. In fact, it's revealed that Cassandra Nova killed at least one version of the character.\n\nLady Deathstrike and Azazel\n\nMore X-Men villains were seen working for Cassandra Nova in The Void, including X2's Lady Deathstirke (Kelly Hu) and X-Men: First Class' Azazel (Jason Flemyng). Once again, these roles were previously confirmed in a trailer, but it was still incredibly fun to see them return to the big screen. Both villains pack a powerful punch, and they don't hold back in the new movie.\n\nJuggernaut\n\nThis marks the third live-action appearance by Juggernaut, and also the third actor to step into the role, which is joked about in the film. Vinnie Jones played the part in X-Men: The Last Stand, and recently revealed he turned down the chance to cameo in Deadpool & Wolverine. In Deadpool 2, Reynolds voiced Juggernaut but the character was credited as \"Himself.\" In Deadpool & Wolverine, the character is played by a new actor, but he still serves an important function. It's revealed that Deadpool and Wolverine need to steal his helmet if they hope to successfully face off with Cassandra Nova.\n\nAaron Stanford as Pyro\n\nIt was revealed earlier this year that Aaron Stanford would be reprising his role as Pyro from X2 and X-Men: The Last Stand. The character had a pretty big role this time around, serving as the right-hand man to Cassandra Nova. Recently, Stanford talked about how happy he was to finally don a suit after all these years.\n\nWunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15\n\nWunmi Mosakus's Hunter B-15 was a huge part of Loki, so it was nice to see her included in Deadpool & Wolverine's TVA storyline. Unfortunately, Marvel Studios revealed her cameo in a TV spot over the weekend, so her appearance wasn't a surprise to everyone. Even still, it was fun to watch her get her flirt on with Deadpool staple, Peter (Rob Delaney).\n\nJennifer Garner as Elektra\n\nMarvel fans were stunned when Jennifer Garner's return to the role of Elektra was announced last year. Garner first played the part in Daredevil (2003) before reprising it in a standalone film, Elektra (2005). While her solo project wasn't exactly well-received (it has an 11% critics score and 29% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes), people still love Garner in the role. It was undeniably exciting to see her suit up again. The character's intro in The Void also features a hilarious joke about her real-life divorce from Ben Affleck, who played Daredevil. While you shouldn't expect to see Affleck in Deadpool & Wolverine, there are still some major surprises to come...\n\nWesley Snipes as Blade\n\nAs the MCU's Blade continues to hit roadblocks, the last thing fans expected was to see Wesley Snipes return to the role in Deadpool & Wolverine. Not only does he joke that there's only one Blade (we're still pulling for you, Mahershala Ali), but he also repeats an iconic line from his first film. There's also a great joke about how Snipes and Reynolds notoriously did not get along on the set of Blade: Trinity. We look forward to finding out how this reunion unfolded behind the scenes.\n\nChanning Tatum as Gambit\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise of the film was Channing Tatum showing up as Gambit. Pretty much every hardcore Marvel fan knows the Magic Mike alum was set to play Remy LeBeau, but the project fell apart when Disney bought Fox. Tatum has opened up about his disappointment in how things unfolded, so it was nice to see the actor finally get his shot. There were lots of meta jokes about his role, but the actor also got the chance to unleash some epic action. Previously, Gambit was seen in live-action when Taylor Kitsch played him in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which was also the first time Jackman and Reynolds shared the screen as their characters.\n\nDafne Keen as Laura/X-23\n\nDafne Keen was recently seen playing Jecki Lon in Star Wars: The Acolyte and she spent her press tour swearing up and down that she wasn't in Deadpool & Wolverine. Turns out, the Logan alum took a page from Andrew Garfield's book of lies. For some reason, Marvel Studios opted to reveal her role in the film only one week before the movie's release, which was a big disappointment considering her entrance in the film feels like it was meant to be a surprise. Either way, it was heartwarming to see Keen reunite with Jackman, and the film managed to do so without tarnishing Logan's legacy.\n\nWhat Is Deadpool & Wolverine About?\n\nIn Marvel Studios' Deadpool & Wolverine, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) will change the history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The film also stars Matthew Macfadyen as Paradox, and Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova, with the return of Deadpool alums Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Carlysle, Leslie Uggams as Blind Al, Karan Soni as Dopinder, Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 as Piotr Rasputin/Colossus, Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead, Rob Delaney as Peter, and Lewis Tan as Shatterstar. Aaron Stanford is returning as Pyro from the X-Men film series, with Jennifer Garner rumored to return as Elektra Natchios.\n\nKevin Feige, Ryan Reynolds, Shawn Levy and Lauren Shuler Donner produce with Louis D'Esposito, Wendy Jacobson, Mary McLaglen, Josh McLaglen, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, George Dewey and Simon Kinberg serving as executive producers. Deadpool & Wolverine is written by Ryan Reynolds & Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick & Zeb Wells & Shawn Levy.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine will be released exclusively in theaters tonight!", "source": {"uri":

Even though technically not part of the MCU, the R-rated films have joyfully riffed on other comic book hero films while also delivering a level of violence that those films would never dare to show on screen.\n\nThe 2019 purchase of 20th Century Fox, which owned the rights to Deadpool and the X-Men, by Disney made it a lot easier to bring the Merc with the Mouth into the MCU, which is finally happening with Deadpool & Wolverine. Naturally, that integration is done with the trademark Deadpool flair via a veritable avalanche of jokes making fun of Marvel's checkered movie history and Wade Wilson/Deadpool/Ryan Reynolds himself.\n\nThe film -- directed by Shawn Levy and written by Levy, Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells -- is such a jokefest that the story doesn't really matter. Using the TVA (Time Variance Authority) from the Disney+ show Loki as a centering device, the film has Deadpool trying to save his own timeline from extinction. In order to do this, he needs to find an alternate timeline version of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to replace the one that died in Logan, a version that, according to the film, was crucial to that timeline's survival.\n\nThat synopsis is really a bunch of nonsense to give the filmmakers an excuse to pair up Deadpool and Wolverine for two hours of mayhem. And, oh, is the chaos glorious. From the moment the two anti-superheroes meet, it is an almost never-ending series of profane insults, bloody fights that do little damage to the self-healers, and a litany of riotous cameos and sight gags that take fans down memory lane.\n\nWithout giving too much away, suffice it to say that the film brings in a bunch of other Marvel heroes to join in on the fun, but maybe not the ones you think they will. True fans will know that Marvel's movie history did not start with 2008's Iron Man, and many of those films are referenced in one way or another. Combined with the history of Deadpool's first appearance in 2009's X-Men Origins: Wolverine, real-life media mergers, and other Hollywood blockbusters, there is a lot that the film can draw from to skewer and honor in equal measures.\n\nThose who've seen the first two Deadpool films may think they know what to expect with this third outing, but they'd be wrong. There are the familiar elements like Deadpool breaking the fourth wall by talking directly to the camera or bouncing back from even the most heinous injuries, but the sheer number of targets for the film's comedy make it almost impossible to keep up. The opening scene sets the tone in a hilarious and grotesque manner, and the fun continues until after the credits end.\n\nAs he showed in the first two films, Reynolds is the perfect match for the character of Deadpool, as he knows exactly to deliver his trademark snark without becoming insufferable. Jackman, after years of playing Wolverine as a tortured soul (both physically and mentally), finally gets to let loose, and the result is as fantastic as fans might hope. That delight extends to all the supporting actors, especially Matthew Macfayden and Rob Delaney.\n\nThis may or may not be the last time the 47-year-old Reynolds stars as Deadpool, and if it is his final bow, he has given fans one of the most satisfying trilogies of all time.

Is It Safe for Kids to Watch?", "body": "Deadpool & Wolverine is an upcoming Marvel Studios film and the first of the Deadpool franchise to be part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, given the nature of previous Deadpool films, parents of superhero fanatics are concerned about whether Deadpool & Wolverine is appropriate for children. Let's take a look at Deadpool and Wolverine's age rating and whether it is R-rated or not.\n\nWhy is Deadpool & Wolverine rated R?\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine received an R-rating due to the coarse language, sexual references, and graphic violence in the film.\n\nIf you are familiar with the first two Deadpool movies, you will understand what type of content gives this film an R-rating. Even though it is now part of the family-friendly MCU, Disney allowed the movie to keep an R-rating. This makes Deadpool & Wolverine the first-ever R-rated MCU film.\n\nThe reason for this rating comes from the sexual references and humor, graphic violence and gore themes. Additionally, all the F-bombs dropped throughout the film ensure that it's not suitable for kids. Fight sequences that involve the use of swords and guns, or even Wolverine's claws, include very graphic blood splatters. As per the NY Post, the film has over 100 F-bombs. This is more than either of the two past films. Additionally, the sexual references and gestures in the movie also contribute to the R-rating of the film. Deadpool's humor, especially, contains a high frequency of sexual metaphors throughout.\n\nIs Deadpool & Wolverine safe for children to watch?\n\nNo, Deadpool & Wolverine is R-rated and is not safe to watch for kids.\n\nEven though the film is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is R-rated. In the United States, children under the age of 17 are required to be accompanied by a parent/guardian over the age of either 21 or 25, depending on the rules and policies of the respective cinema.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elton_fernandes@comingsoon.net", "name": "Elton Fernandes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Deadpool-Wolverine-2.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is confirmed as a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie, but should it be considered part of one of the MCU's phases?\n\nMarvel is currently working its way towards the end of Phase 5 of the MCU, which kicked off with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania in February 2023 and ends with the May 2025 launch of Thunderbolts*. Deadpool & Wolverine launches in 2024 as the only MCU movie of the year, but according to the people behind it, it shouldn't be considered part of Marvel's phase structure even if technically it is a part of Phase 5.\n\nIn a recent interview with IGN, director Shawn Levy said Deadpool & Wolverine is \"not part of any phase that I know of\" when asked if the movie acts as a \"full stop\" for the two superhero characters, or whether they will appear in more MCU projects down the line.\n\nHere's Levy's comment in full:\n\n\"I love these characters so much. I love these performers, these actors, these stars, these icons so much. I don't know what the future holds. I will say this, we very intentionally did not want to make a Marvel movie that is a commercial or a setup for the next Marvel movie. So we are not part of any phase that I know of. We acknowledge the antecedents, we respect the legacy that we're inheriting, but our goal was to do a self-contained story. As to whether these characters move on from here, time will tell, but I'd sure love to see it and I'd also love to be a part of it.\"\n\nWe then put this to Feige himself in a follow-up interview, which you can read in full here. Feige responded to insist Marvel is sticking with the phase system and that Deadpool & Wolverine is a part of it, but the film shouldn't be thought of in this way.\n\n\"Phasing out phases? No, I mean phases have always simply been the point in time in which the project's made, and this movie is very much, as you've already referenced with Deadpool discussing the current state of the MCU, very much of its time of where we are in the phases,\" Feige told IGN.\n\n\"So I would say it's in there, but that's sort of beside the point when it comes to Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine occupies a unique spot in the MCU, then, which sparks obvious questions about whether or not the two characters are now set to appear in future superhero team-up movies. Could Deadpool and Wolverine join the X-Men and face-off against The Avengers at some point, perhaps? Maybe we'll find out more during Marvel's hotly anticipated panel at San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nIn the shorter term, MCU Phase 6 kicks off with 2025's The Fantastic Four movie, and is also set to include Blade, as well as two new Avengers movies. IGN's Deadpool & Wolverine review returned a 7/10. We said: \"Deadpool & Wolverine is a hilarious superhero buddy comedy full of surprising, self-referential MCU humor and unsurprising plot and pacing problems.\"\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's their naked sentimentality, the way all that reflexive irony gives way to bumper-sticker bromides like \"Family isn't an F-word\" and \"The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you, but what it does to the people you love.\" Sure, Wade Wilson, Reynolds' \"merc with a mouth,\" is a professional killer who slices up people for fun and profit, but deep down, he's just a big softie.\n\nImagine my surprise, then, to find myself, somewhere in the middle of Deadpool & Wolverine, experiencing a moment of genuine emotion. The movie itself could hardly be a more mercenary enterprise, a threequel that serves to integrate a wildly successful franchise into the wobbly Marvel Cinematic Universe, and to further untangle the jumble of intellectual property caused by Disney's acquisition of Fox. The first two Deadpool movies made endless sport of their hero's C-list status, his unfitness to share the screen with any but the most obscure and unwanted of X-Men despite the fact that they technically exist in the same intellectual property sandbox. In Deadpool 2, while strolling through their home base, Wade catches a brief glimpse of the core X-Men team -- Professor X, Cyclops, the works -- in an adjoining room, and they silently shut the door on him.\n\nAnd yet, here he is, sharing a screen with Wolverine, a character he's obsessed over and cursed out at length -- and further, drawing Hugh Jackman back to a part he swore he'd finished playing after 2017's Logan, a movie that seemed to have quite definitively killed off his nigh-indestructible superhero. But nothing is final in the multiverse, and Disney didn't spend all that money buying up the rights to Fox's Marvel characters just to have some nobody step into the role. So Jackman is back, bulking up his biceps and cashing a similarly hulking paycheck. (In one of his characteristic pokes at the fourth wall, Deadpool takes note of the fact that Jackman is recently divorced.) A fight to the death between characters who can heal from almost any wound is the stuff of comic-book dreams, but it can only be realized in a series where gore is played for laughs and blood flies with the abandon of children dousing each other with Super Soakers.\n\nThere are plot reasons why Deadpool & Wolverine's titular heroes come to blows -- and stabs, and shots -- but the main one is that Logan has a short temper and Wade can't stop running his mouth. Ryan Reynolds knows he has a face made for punching, even after it's covered in fake burn scars, and he makes sure we see him undergo every torment imaginable. (At one point, Wolverine jabs Deadpool in the groin with his claws, then uses them to lift him over his head, bring him down hard, and break his back.) But the movie is also the product of another, equally grueling ordeal: the decades-long struggle to make Ryan Reynolds happen. As the Deadpool series is fond of reminding us, this isn't Reynolds' first shot at superhero stardom -- in fact, it's not even his first time starring as this particular character. In 2009, Reynolds played Deadpool as a mute, tattooed villain -- a merc with no mouth -- in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and two years later he was the lead in DC's Green Lantern movie. It was the kind of role that could make a career, except that it almost ended his when the movie was an enormous flop. So when, in a string of gags that run through the end credits of Deadpool, Wade borrows a universe-hopping device to \"clean up the timeline,\" he pays a visit to Reynolds, beaming over his copy of the Green Lantern script, and puts a bullet through his skull.\n\nReynolds put everything into the first Deadpool, to the extent that he diverted his own salary toward having the film's writers on set to constantly pep up the film's dialogue. (Deadpool & Wolverine has five credited writers, including Reynolds and director Shawn Levy, and there are stretches where you can practically hear them all competing to yell out the funniest, most foul-mouthed one-liner.) The gamble paid off handsomely: The first two movies grossed more than $700 million apiece, a total that recent MCU entries have only fitfully achieved, and the new one is on track for the biggest opening weekend of the year. But Reynolds is aware as few are how close you can get to stardom without achieving it, and he's had far more chances than most people get. Which turns out, in a strange way, to be what Deadpool & Wolverine is about.\n\nNow that the contracts have been signed and Deadpool has officially joined the Marvel universe, the series' stakes have gone from interpersonal to intergalactic. They're even higher because the once unstoppable MCU is fully in its flop era, reworking long-range plans as its stewards struggle with box-office failures and casting changes. (\"Welcome to the MCU,\" Deadpool tells Logan. \"You're joining at a bit of a low point.\") In the retro bureaucracy of the multiverse-governing Time Variance Authority (you remember them from Loki, right?), Deadpool is informed that his world has been rendered unstable by the absence of its \"anchor entity,\" and without that person, the entire thing will eventually cease to exist. When we learn that entity is Logan, and that Wade's world essentially comprises the Marvel characters formerly owned by Fox, the whole thing snaps into focus. Without Wolverine, the X-Men aren't worth keeping around. It would be like owning all of Spider-Man's universe except for the part with Spider-Man in it.\n\nWade's mission to protect his timeline also becomes a mission on behalf of the characters who didn't quite make it, the heroes whose futures were snuffed out by subpar opening weekends or C-suite changes. Banished to the Void, where the Time Variance Authority sends things that no longer have any purpose -- including a crumbling logo for the former 20 Century Fox -- Wade and Logan encounter a string of Marvel's has-beens and never-wases, played by actors whose mere appearance is a sight gag unto itself. Some were big in their day, some never even had a chance, but they've faded from view in one way or another, their characters gathering dust on the shelf. (I'm going to spoil these appearances now, so if you want to go in fresh, just skip the next paragraph.)\n\nIt's a thrill to see Wesley Snipes' Blade again, and a comedic coup to finally see Channing Tatum's take on the Cajun card-thrower Gambit, the star of a solo spinoff movie that was never made. (Its planned release date was March 13, 2020, so this may have been a blessing in disguise.) But there's poignancy in their appearances, too. Snipes' Blade brags that he's one of a kind, unaware that his iconic role is scheduled to pass to Mahershala Ali in 2025, and when Logan offers Elektra (Jennifer Garner) his condolences on the passing of Daredevil (Ben Affleck), Garner cuts him off with a crisp, \"It's fine.\" They all seem a little worse for wear, happy to be extracted from whatever limbo unused characters inhabit (the otherwise successful Blade franchise ended in a flurry of bitter lawsuits, while Elektra became the lowest-grossing Marvel movie since Howard the Duck), but too bruised by past experience to think things will go any better this time. (Spoilers over.)\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine gives these castoffs an ending of sorts, even if it's not the one they would have wanted. And there's something oddly moving about it, even in a proudly crass movie whose bittersweet nostalgia is tinged with corporate triumphalism. The juxtaposition is no less calculated than it is when Deadpool stops cracking wise about sex toys and starts talking about love, but for better or worse, this time it works. Watching these characters whose fictional lives were cut short by the vagaries of an unforgiving industry, I thought of all the disappointments that fandom is heir to: the abruptly canceled shows whose mysteries will never be unraveled, the beloved stories bungled on their journey to the screen, the Coming Soons that never came. Dotted in among the quips and Easter eggs is the superhero equivalent of Toy Story 2, a mournful goodbye to the things we once held dear, even if some of those things weren't that great to begin with.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_adams@slate.com", "name": "Sam Adams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

It could be the first franchise to hit that landmark.\n\nAccording to The Numbers, MCU has made just over $29.7 billion worldwide throughout its 33 past releases. Deadpool and Wolverine has been tracking for a $360 million opening weekend at the box office.\n\nIf that happens, the MCU will easily pass $30 billion as a franchise. That would mean each Marvel movie has made about $882 million on average. However, it is important to note that some installments help boost it while lower-grossing movies bring it down.\n\nThe highest-grossing MCU movies\n\nPer The Numbers, these are the top 10 highest-grossing Marvel Cinematic Universe movies to date. So far, 10 of the MCU movies have crossed $1 billion at the box office. The first to do so was The Avengers in 2012.\n\nThe MCU kicked off in 2008 with Iron Man. The inaugural Robert Downey Jr.-led movie made over $580 million during its theatrical run.\n\nAs the franchise continued forward, the numbers kept increasing. The first Avengers team-up movie was the first to top $1 billion, with the following three also following that trend.\n\nHowever, recently, the MCU has been on a bit of a skid. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and The Marvels both underperformed after grossing $463 and $199 million, respectively.\n\nAt the same time, other recent Marvel sequels such as SpiderMan: No Way Home ($1.9 billion), Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($952 million), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever ($853 million), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 ($845 million) have all fared well.\n\nWhat is Deadpool and Wolverine?\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is the thirty-fourth movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It teams Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's iconic characters for the first time.\n\nThe movie picks up a few years after the events of Deadpool 2. By this point, Wade Wilson (Reynolds) has used Cable's time machine to save his fianc\u00e9e Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and his X-Force friends.\n\nThe Time Variance Authority (TVA) subsequently recruits him for a mission. To assist him, Wade seeks the help of a Wolverine (Jackman). Together, they have to take on a new threat, Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), as well as save Wade's universe.\n\nSeveral Deadpool stars return to reprise their roles. Leslie Uggams, Rob Delaney, Karan Soni, Brianna Hildebrand, and Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107 are a few of the names coming back.\n\nOther stars from Fox's Marvel movies, such as Jennifer Garner, Dafne Keen, Aaron Stanford, and Tyler Mane, will also return.\n\nShawn Levy directed Deadpool and Wolverine, co-writing the script with Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells. Levy is known for his work in the Stranger Things franchise, serving as a producer and also directing several episodes.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is the only MCU movie coming out in 2024. This follows a year in which three movies came out. 2025 will see four movies be released -- Captain America: Brave New World, Thunderbolts, The Fantastic Four, and Blade.", "source": {"uri":

The new movie sees Ryan Reynolds wise-cracking Wade Wilson join forces with Hugh Jackman's tough-as-Adamantium Logan to take on the forces of both the TVA from Loki and the evil mutant Cassandra Nova.\n\nPrecisely how and why Deadpool and Wolverine cross paths is complicated. The film opens with Wade searching for Logan in... unusual circumstances. When that doesn't quite work out, he sets off across multiple realities, seeking a hero who can help him. That's where he meets this lot: the Wolverine variants.\n\nIf you've seen the new movie and were curious about who these alternate Wolverines were then you're in the right place. Be warned, though, there are big spoilers for the new movie from here on in.\n\nLogan\n\nOK, this one's probably a technicality given that he's pretty conclusively dead, but the first variant that Deadpool encounters in the film is the Adamantium skeleton of Logan from James Mangold's 2017 modern r-rated classic. This is not particularly helpful given that Wade desperately needs the help of a living Wolverine. Still, he makes the best of a bad situation by using Logan's metal bones as weapons against the TVA in the brutal, bloody fight that opens the film.\n\nThe short king Wolverine\n\nOne of the first variants that Deadpool meets is a surprisingly short version of Logan, albeit still played by Hugh Jackman. This is more than just a size gag, however. While Jackman stands tall at 6 ft 2, Wolverine in Marvel comics is notably shorter at 5 ft 3. This one version looks even shorter than that, but it's clear that this is intended to be a fun reference to the comic book Wolverine's short king status.\n\nPatch\n\n\"Patch\" is an identity that Wolverine originally took on while working as a vigilante in Madripoor back in the '80s comics. Marvel also recently revived the identity for 2022's prequel comic Wolverine: Patch. It's not explained in Deadpool and Wolverine precisely who this version of Wolverine is, or why he doesn't help Deadpool, but it's a cool throwback to some of Logan's greatest adventures.\n\nThe crucified Wolverine\n\nThe film calls back to one of the most famous Wolverine images of all time when Deadpool arrives in a universe where Logan has been painfully crucified on a giant X. This is a nod to Marc Silvestri's cover for Uncanny X-Men #251. In the story, Wolverine is pinned to the cross by the mutant-hating Reavers, led by Donald Pierce AKA White King and Lady Deathstrike.\n\nThe early Wolverine\n\nOne of the more baffling Wolverine variants in the film is a long-haired '80s throwback-looking Logan. It's not as clear-cut as some of the other Wolverines just what this is a reference to, but we're guessing this is meant to be a callback to Wolverine's early solo adventures and his look on the cover of Wolverine #1 by John Buscema and Al Williamson.\n\nOld Man Logan\n\nThis grizzled variant appears briefly in the multiverse-crossing montage. Old Man Logan was the older, more grizzled Logan from Earth-807128 created by Mark Millar and artist Steve McNiven in the comics. He's been a highly-influential creation over the years and was a direct inspiration for the direction of the character in James Mangold's Logan.\n\nWeapon X\n\nThe Wolverine of Earth-295 - AKA the world of Age of Apocalypse - briefly appears, rocking his trademark metal left arm. In this reality Wolverine goes by the code name Weapon X.\n\nThe classic John Byrne Wolverine\n\nIconic Marvel artist John Byrne gets a direct namecheck by Deadpool shortly before we see a variant of Logan wearing the yellow and brown suit that Byrne gifted the character. In another fun cameo, we briefly see the arrival of the Hulk - a nod to Wolverine's very first comic appearance, which saw him take on Bruce Banner. If you want to find out more about how Logan's look has changed over the years, check out our guide to Wolverine's suit here.\n\nThe Cavillerine\n\nOne of the film's biggest cameos comes in the form of former Superman actor Henry Cavill, who makes a jaw-dropping appearance here as a new variant of Wolverine, listed as The Cavillerine in the credits! Hint at a future casting, or just a big, fun joke? Our money is on the latter, but it's a great moment either way.\n\nThe worst Wolverine\n\nFinally, Deadpool meets a variant who he is able to talk into helping him. This is a Wolverine who has grown broken and bitter following his failure to prevent the murder of all the other X-Men. He's become a hard-drinking killer who not-so-secretly dwells on the overwhelming guilt that he feels at losing his friends. The question is, will Deadpool and Wolverine give him a shot at redemption?", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This article contains spoilers for Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nSummary In Deadpool & Wolverine's ending, the duo defeats Cassandra Nova by disabling the Time Ripper and stopping the villain from destroying the multiverse. Deadpool and Wolverine both survive, with the former rekindling his relationship with Vanessa and finding his purpose in the MCU multiverse. Wolverine and X-23 permanently switch to Deadpool's universe, teasing their return - alongside other Fox X-Men characters - in the MCU's future.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine's ending is suitably action-packed, bringing a lot of questions about the fate of the multiverse, the film's villains, and the future of the MCU. After years of anticipation, the next installment in both the Fox X-Men movies and the Marvel Cinematic Universe is here. As expected, the film combines both franchises with Deadpool & Wolverine's cast comprising familiar faces from across Marvel's illustrious cinematic past. In Deadpool & Wolverine, the titular duo tentatively team up to stop the nefarious plans of Cassandra Nova while protecting the very fabric of the Marvel multiverse.\n\nNaturally, this story comes with a lot of twists and turns. The multiversal cameos many expect from a movie of this size are included in full force, with the anticipation of returning heroes driving Deadpool & Wolverine's box office hopes. That said, the cameos and surprises never overtake the core story at the center of the movie: Deadpool's desire to save his universe and Wolverine's need for redemption. By the time of Deadpool & Wolverine's ending, this story comes to a close in a way that raises several questions for the future of Marvel in film.\n\nHow Deadpool And Wolverine Stop Cassandra Nova's Attempt To Destroy The Multiverse Close\n\nAs the final act of Deadpool & Wolverine descends, the goal becomes clear; Cassandra Nova is attempting to use a device from the TVA called the Time Ripper to destroy every branch of the multiverse, leaving only the Void remaining as her own kingdom to rule. Naturally, Deadpool and Wolverine try to stop her. Deadpool& Wolverine's Mr. Paradox explains to the duo that the Time Ripper works by combining matter and anti-matter, and the only way to destroy the machine is by harnessing both forms of power simultaneously, redirecting them from the machine.\n\nTheir combined strength sees Deadpool and Wolverine survive the attempt as the Time Ripper is destroyed, saving the entire multiverse...\n\nAfter fighting through the Deadpool Corps, Deadpool and Wolverine fight over who is going to sustain the blast of matter and anti-matter, as Mr. Paradox explained it will disintegrate whoever does. Deadpool wins out via deception and begins harnessing the power to stop the Time Ripper and Cassandra. However, he cannot reach both sides of the power source, prompting Wolverine to jump in as both heroes take the blast together. Their combined strength sees Deadpool and Wolverine survive the attempt as the Time Ripper is destroyed, saving the entire multiverse.\n\nIs Cassandra Nova Dead?\n\nOne of the primary questions stemming out of Deadpool & Wolverine's ending is what became of Cassandra Nova. While the movie does not give a definitive answer in its dialogue, it is safe to say Cassandra Nova perishes as the Time Ripper is destroyed. As Deadpool and Wolverine destroy the machine, Cassandra is shown atomizing, ending her threat to the multiverse. Although a variant of Cassandra Nova could make an appearance in an upcoming MCU movie, the version shown in Deadpool & Wolverine is no more.\n\nWhat Happens To Mr. Paradox\n\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine, Mr. Paradox is a secondary villain. He has an unstable deal with Cassandra Nova that eventually sees the two come at odds, with his goal being to control the TVA and return it to the more brutal, prune-happy organization it was under He Who Remains. It is revealed that his group of TVA agents is being kept secret from his superiors, that being Hunter B-15 from Loki. However, the powering up of the Time Ripper alerts B-15 to Paradox's plans. Deadpool & Wolverine ends with Paradox being arrested by B-15 as his group is disbanded.\n\nCould Loki Have Stopped The Destruction Of The Multiverse?\n\nDespite the appearance of Hunter B-15 in Deadpool & Wolverine, Loki was not mentioned. As is known thanks to Loki season 2's ending, the multiverse is now formed as an Yggdrasil tree with Loki at its center. Loki is responsible for holding the fabric of the multiverse together, begging the question of whether he could have intervened and stopped Cassandra's potential destruction of the timelines.\n\nGiven what is known of Loki season 2's finale, this is unlikely. Loki is not protecting the multiverse, but instead holding it together. If he is not there to grasp the timelines, the multiverse dies, meaning he cannot leave to intervene. As such, Loki must simply watch and trust that the TVA and other heroes will stop multiversal threats.\n\n2:24 Related Loki Season 2 Ending Explained\n\nLoki season 2's finale is massive for the MCU as well as for the God of Mischief who's found his ultimate glorious purpose while saving the TVA.\n\nWhat Happens To Deadpool Close\n\nAs alluded to, Deadpool survives the destruction of the Time Ripper in Deadpool & Wolverine's ending. The epilogue of the film sees him encounter characters like Hunter B-15, giving hints about the future of the Multiverse Saga. Collectively, Deadpool and Wolverine served as the so-called Anchor Beings of the Fox X-Men timeline. Anchor Beings are individuals who, if removed from their timelines, cause the destruction of their universe. Deadpool, therefore, returned to Earth-10005 to live peacefully.\n\nDo Deadpool And Vanessa Get Back Together?\n\nThe driving force of Deadpool's journey in Deadpool & Wolverine is his relationship with Vanessa. The same can be said for the first two installments in the Deadpool franchise, with the third movie revolving around Deadpool trying to save his universe and thus, Vanessa. This comes after the two break-up years earlier due to Wade's lack of motivation and drive to push himself. In Deadpool & Wolverine's ending Wade tells Vanessa that he still has feelings for her, and the two are shown holding hands, hinting that they will be back together in future movies.\n\nWhat's Deadpool's Higher Purpose?\n\nAs alluded to by the exploration of Wade's relationship with Vanessa, Deadpool & Wolverine surrounds the former hero trying to find his purpose. He is often told that he is meaningless and lives for nothing bigger than himself, explaining his faith in Wolverine as someone who is accustomed to doing so. Throughout the film, however, Deadpool is told by Paradox and others that he has a higher purpose. This could be seen as him saving his timeline in Deadpool & Wolverine's ending but is more likely a set-up for his potential role as an Avenger in Avengers 5's upcoming story and Avengers: Secret Wars.\n\nRelated Avengers: Secret Wars: Release Date, Plot Details & Everything We Know\n\nThe culmination of phases 4, 5, and 6 of the MCU will be in Avengers: Secret Wars. Here's everything to know about the sixth Avengers movie.\n\nWhat About Thor!?\n\nA hilarious running gag throughout Deadpool & Wolverine involves none other than Thor. When Deadpool first enters the TVA, he is accidentally shown what is seemingly a moment in Deadpool's future. This moment sees Deadpool lying injured in Thor's arms as the latter cries for him, akin to Loki's fake death scene in Thor: The Dark World. Whether Deadpool and Thor's touching moment ever comes to pass remains to be seen, but Deadpool & Wolverine's ending certainly leaves it off as a potentially humorous callback for future movies to capitalize on.\n\nWhat Happens To Wolverine\n\nAs is the case with his ally, Wolverine survives the Time Ripper's explosion. Afterward, Logan is shown somewhat at a loss, resigning to retire from hero work and living a peaceful life. This comes after Wolverine puts his guilt and grief over the death of his universe's X-Men behind him, completing his character arc in Deadpool & Wolverine's ending. That said, some interesting moments in Wolverine's epilogue hint at future stories for him in the world of the Marvel multiverse.\n\nDid Wolverine & X-23 Just Permanently Switch Universes?\n\nAfter Logan attempts to leave in Deadpool & Wolverine's ending, Wade invites him for food and introduces Wolverine to Blind Al. In the final scene of the movie, Logan and X-23 are shown bonding with Deadpool, Al, Vanessa, and the other characters from Deadpool and Deadpool 2. This seemingly implies that Logan and X-23 have permanently switched to Earth-10005. With the latter being pruned and the former not having much of a meaning in his original timeline, the TVA has allowed them to live with Deadpool in the Fox X-Men universe.\n\nWill Hugh Jackman Return As Wolverine?\n\nWith Deadpool & Wolverine's ending confirming Logan's survival on Earth-10005, the burning question now is whether Hugh Jackman will return once more as the character. Various meta jokes are made throughout Deadpool & Wolverine, specifically a recurring gag that Jackman will be playing Wolverine until he is 90 years old. Although this is a way for the film to poke fun at superhero casting in general, it comes after a serious moment in which B-15 states Wolverine and Deadpool could be useful thanks to their timeline-saving antics, hinting that Jackman will return in the MCU's future.\n\nWhat Deadpool & Wolverine's Ending Means For Avengers 5 & 6\n\nAside from the fates of the main characters, Deadpool & Wolverine's ending raises questions about how the film will tie into the future of the MCU. Many expected Deadpool & Wolverine to feed into Avengers 5 and Avengers: Secret Wars, a reality that now seems possible. Not only have Deadpool and Wolverine been recognized as potential allies by the TVA, but they have solidified their partnership and returned to Deadpool's universe. Interestingly, this means that the Fox X-Men universe lives on.\n\nDeadpool also has a connection with Happy Hogan after attempting to join the Avengers, making his potential future with the team more likely.\n\nIt was expected that Deadpool & Wolverine's ending would see one, or both, of the characters permanently switch to the MCU, but this was not the case. Instead, the X-Men timeline remains intact, meaning the two titular heroes can return in the future. Not only that, but any character from the Fox X-Men franchise could play a part in future MCU movies, leading to many possibilities for Avengers 5 & 6. As of Deadpool & Wolverine's ending, the multiverse has never had so many intriguing connections, promising a big future for Marvel's Multiverse Saga.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine R\n\nA follow-up to the highly successful Deadpool and Deadpool 2 films starring Ryan Reynolds as the Merc with a Mouth. The third film will be the first in the franchise to be developed under the Marvel Studios banner following Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox.\n\nDirector Shawn Levy Release Date July 26, 2024

It's a moment that's ostensibly played for laughs - and one that takes on greater significance when you consider the inconsistent quality of Marvel's theatrical and Disney Plus output since 2019's Avengers: Endgame.\n\nAnd yet, after leaving my IMAX screening of the highly anticipated Marvel Phase 5 movie, I couldn't shake the feeling that Wilson wasn't completely joking. That's because Deadpool and Wolverine is easily one of the best Marvel movies of the last five years - and I'm not rolling out that clich\u00e9d remark to be an industry shill.\n\nYes, it's overly chaotic on occasion, which is to be expected for a Deadpool-starring project, and its wobbly plot and half-baked villains underwhelmed me. Those niggles aside, though, it's a gloriously gory, riotously funny, cameo-stuffed, and surprisingly endearing flick, even if it isn't the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) savior we all expected it to be.\n\nSet six years after 2018's Deadpool 2, The Merc With a Mouth's third big-screen adventure finds Wilson working as a used-car salesman after retiring from the superhero game. That is, until the TVA kidnap him at a birthday party to deliver some bad news: his universe - designated Earth-10005 - is dying, and there's nothing he or they can do about it.\n\nThe reason for his reality's inevitable demise? Its anchor being - a person of such vital importance to a universe that, without them, it cannot exist - has died, meaning that Wilson's timeline is slowly withering away. Oh, and said anchor being is none other than the Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) that passed away in 2017's grimdark X-Men flick Logan.\n\nSo, the TVA offers Wilson a choice: leave his universe behind, cross over into the MCU, and fulfil his dream of becoming an Avenger, or turn them down, re-join his friends, and prepare for the end. Of course, this ultimatum doesn't sit well with the renegade antihero. Devising his own on-the-spot plan - what did you expect? - Deadpool steals one of the TVA's multiverse-hopping Temp-Pads and sets off to find a new Wolverine; one he hopes he can simply use to replace his timeline's dead hero, and save it and his friends.\n\nUnfortunately for Deadpool, said journey eventually leads him to cross paths with a new Wolverine (again played by Jackman) who, for reasons I won't spoil, is responsible for destroying his own world. With no other choices available to him, Deadpool must convince the multiverse's so-called 'worst Wolverine' to help him save his reality, no matter the cost.\n\nIt's this odd-couple dynamic that, in light of its somewhat threadbare plot, Deadpool 3 hangs its hat on. As long-time friends, Reynolds and Jackman's off-screen chemistry bleeds onto the screen with little effort, the duo using their playful real-life rivalry to great effect to bring wisecracks and melodrama aplenty to the pair's fraught dynamic.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Reynolds brings the requisite wit, fourth-wall-breaking snark, and periodic poignancy to a character who's as ready to pour his heart out this time around as he is to drop a cultural reference or f-bomb. However, it's Jackman, returning for one last outing as Wolverine in Deadpool 3 (apparently, anyway), whose rage-filled and regret-laced performance is far more brutal from an emotional perspective. He may have been playing the iconic adamantium-clawed mutant for 24 years (at the time of writing) but, Logan aside, this is his most accomplished and multidimensional display yet.\n\nReynolds and Jackman don't just deserve praise for playing the titular pair, either. Indeed, thanks to the movie's anarchic multiversal elements (more on these later), the A-listers portray numerous variants of their characters - read more in our Deadpool and Wolverine cameos piece - enabling them to play fast and loose with said variants, and showcase their unquestionable talents in all manner of funny and/or comic book-influenced situations within Marvel's cinematic sandbox. There are two in particular - one for each actor - that not only made me laugh out loud whenever they appeared on the screen, but also had everyone else at my screening guffawing.\n\nGiven its title, it won't come as a shock to learn that Deadpool and Wolverine leans heavily on the mismatched pair's road-trip-inspired misadventures, but they aren't the only individuals who show up throughout the film's two-hour runtime.\n\nOne of Deadpool 3's other notable inclusions is Macfayden's Mister Paradox, a slimy TVA mutineer who harbors ambitions of being the interdimensional bureaucratic orgainzation's new commander-in-chief. A morally complex individual, Paradox acts as a secondary antagonist throughout, his unsettlingly calm persona reminding me of notable villains portrayed by beloved actor Richard E. Grant (incidentally, he appeared in Loki season 1 as one of the trickster god's variants) in non-MCU TV show and movies, such as Doctor Who and, ironically, Logan.\n\nJoining Paradox on the rogues gallery front is Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin, who uses they/them pronouns), the twin sister (she's technically a parasitic lifeform known as a mummadrai, but the details aren't important) of X-Men founder Charles Xavier/Professor X who reshapes Wolverine and Deadpool's entire dynamic upon her introduction.\n\nLike her 'sibling', Nova is an incredibly powerful telepath but, while her brother walks an honorable path, Nova is a malicious entity with a penchant for sadism. Given her and Wolverine's ties to Xavier, Nova is an aptly evil foil to the film's heroes, and Corrin imbues her with a delightful monstrosity and devilish glee that provides another example of their undisputed acting talents.\n\nThe problem that mars Paradox and Nova's involvement in Deadpool and Wolverine, though, is that they're criminally underutilized. Macfayden and Corrin are a joy to watch as they plot and scheme their way towards their end goals, but their characters feel shoehorned into proceedings out of necessity. The movie needs a villain or two for our heroes to rail against, after all, but it's the manner with which they're woven into the fabric of its story that disappointed me. They're both compelling antagonists to our red- and yellow costume-clad champions, and yet they they feel like afterthoughts whose sole intention is to drive the plot forward in minimalist fashion. The Marvel villain curse, then, strikes again.\n\nBut it's not Paradox and Nova who suffer from Deadpool and Wolverine's extraneous storytelling - the plot itself doesn't feel all that sturdy, either. On the surface, it's coherent enough and contains its fair share of high-stakes action and drama, but dig deeper and Deadpool 3's shaky narrative threatens to collapse in on itself, especially when it reaches its climax, which is cheaply assembled and simply wraps up one of the movie's most important questions without a second thought. Without trying to spoil too much, apart from the odd comment about what might await Deadpool later in the Multiverse Saga, it doesn't tease any future plans Marvel has for Phase 5 or Phase 6. So, temper your expectations accordingly.\n\nConsidering its story and villain-based flaws, it's a good job that Deadpool and Wolverine delivers on its nostalgia-fueled promise to, in Deadpool's words, \"give the people what they want.\"\n\nAnd, by that, I mean not to scrimp on the Marvel cameo and/or legacy character front. Despite the fact it delivered on the 'fantasy casting' with its own crowd-pleasing cameos, Doctor Strange 2 was a let down in the multiversal character appearance stakes, while Loki could've gone harder - season 1 episode 5 notwithstanding - with its own variant collection. Spider-Man: No Way Home did, however, earn plenty of points on the sentimentality scale for bringing webslingers (and their biggest foes) from three different eras together in a big-screen team-up for the first time.\n\nBy comparison to that trio, Deadpool and Wolverine goes hard. Think of No Way Home dialled up to 11 and you'll catch my drift. From the return of classic X-Men villains - one of whom partakes in an X-Men movie rematch that fans have waited 24 years for - to a poignant reunion (of sorts) between Wolverine and Dafne Keen's X-23, the character's daughter/clone who made her live-action debut in Logan, the 34th MCU movie is brimming with call-backs to 20th Century Fox's X-Men film series. There are plenty of other astonishing Fox-based legacy superhero cameos in this celebration of the rebranded studio's now-defunct cinematic franchise, but you'll have to see the film (or read the cameo list I linked to earlier) to get the details on those blockbuster moments.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is a barnstorming popcorn flick that acts as an unapologetic and self-aware riposte Marvel has clearly wanted to deliver to its detractors for some time. Yes, it's a film plagued by longstanding issues that the comic giant has struggled to get to grips with throughout its cinematic tenure but, if you look past those deficiencies, you'll revel in its passionate tribute to Fox's superhero-led projects and the uproarious bromance at its heart.\n\nWildly entertaining as it is, I don't believe Deadpool and Wolverine will be the MCU's savior - but that's not the movie's fault. Yes, it's sure to be a worldwide hit at the box office (industry insiders suggest it'll easily make over $1 billion globally), but it'll take more than a single film to get Marvel's cinematic juggernaut back on track. The last few years have proven as much, with every great release, such as Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and X-Men 97, being weighed down by panned projects like The Marvels and Secret Invasion.\n\nIf Marvel can recapture the magic of the Infinity Saga from this point on, we can wistfully look back on Deadpool and Wolverine as the fulcrum behind the MCU's resurgence. Until the likes of Captain America: Brave New World and The Fantastic Four charge into theaters and confirm or deny that reports of the MCU's demise have been exaggerated, Deadpool and Wolverine will, to me, be an absolutely brilliant Marvel movie, but one I won't be labeling as the MCU's savior just yet.", "source": {"uri": "techradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechRadar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_power@techradar.com", "name": "Tom Power", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paradox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teams_and_organizations_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teams and organizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adventure fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IMAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clich\u00e9", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clich\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antihero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_E._Grant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard E.

With their allies, they storm Cassandra's lair and use Juggernaut's helmet to suppress her powers. Laura (X-23) manages to retrieve the helmet and throws it to Deadpool, who places it on Cassandra's head.\n\nHowever, Pyro, who had made a deal with Paradox to kill Cassandra, fires several shots at her. Logan decides not to kill Cassandra, realizing she is their only way out of the Void. Instead, she uses a sling ring to open a portal to Earth-10005 but attempts to destroy the multiverse. She sends regenerating Deadpool variants to fight Deadpool and Wolverine. Peterpool arrives and distracts the variants, allowing Deadpool and Wolverine to reach Paradox.\n\nParadox explains that shutting down the Time Ripper requires creating an energy bridge between its matter and antimatter power sources, which would likely result in death. Wolverine, feeling guilty for not saving his own world, wants to do it. However, Deadpool locks him out and hitches himself to the power sources.\n\nAs Deadpool begins to disintegrate, Wolverine breaks down the door, grabs Deadpool's hand, and strengthens the bridge. Together, they cause the Time Ripper to explode, resulting in an unexpected casualty.\n\nToward the end, Deadpool and Wolverine can be seen having shawarma. Logan initially plans to leave but ends up joining Deadpool's group of friends, including Blind Al. This ending places Deadpool and Wolverine in the Fox universe, now part of the MCU multiverse, setting the stage for future interactions while keeping them in their distinct timeline.\n\nWhat happens to Paradox and will he return?\n\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine, TVA agent B-15 apprehends Paradox after he fails to end the multiverse. The evolving MCU storyline suggests he might reappear in future narratives due to his unresolved threads and complex background, even though his immediate threat is neutralized.\n\nWhat happens to Cassandra Nova and will she return?\n\nCassandra Nova meets her end when Deadpool and Wolverine successfully shut down the Time Ripper. The explosion annihilates Nova, conclusively eliminating her threat. The film portrays her disintegration as definitive, leaving no chance for survival in future MCU installments. However, in the Marvel multiverse, characters can reappear in alternate timelines or different forms, allowing for endless possibilities.\n\nWhat happens to Blade, Gambit, Elektra, and Laura (X-23)?\n\nIn the movie, Blade, Gambit, Elektra, and Laura (X-23) join Deadpool and Wolverine in a high-stakes battle against Cassandra Nova. They successfully defeat many of Nova's henchmen and play key roles in using Juggernaut's helmet against her. However, Alioth, a powerful entity, arrives and seemingly devours them, leaving their fate uncertain.\n\nFollowing the TVA's arrest of Paradox, Deadpool asks if there is any chance to rescue his allies. The TVA agent responds that they will \"see what they can do,\" leaving the ultimate fate of Blade, Gambit, Elektra, and X-23 up in the air.\n\nInterestingly, Wade's gathering later features Laura / X-23, suggesting she was either saved or is a variant from another timeline.

We hadn't shown it yet, [But] Disney wanted to unveil the character in the trailer because X-23's appearance teases an emotional core of the movie.\"\n\nFeige agreed, and believes unveiling this particular character was the right movie. \"It was great in the final trailer\" and \"that meant Dafne could come to the premiere.\"\n\nTo be fair, it did give that trailer a lot of emotional impact, and there are so many surprises/cameos in Deadpool and Wolverine that we can't imagine audiences complaining too much about this one being spoiled after they see the movie.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine currently sits at 80% on Rotten Tomatoes with 153 reviews counted.\n\nThe MPAA recently gave the movie an official R-rating for: \"Strong bloody violence and language throughout, gore, and sexual references.\"\n\n\"Marvel Studios presents their most significant mistake to date - Deadpool & Wolverine,\" reads the new synopsis. \"A listless Wade Wilson toils away in civilian life. His days as the morally flexible mercenary, Deadpool, behind him. When his homeworld faces an existential threat, Wade must reluctantly suit-up again with an even more reluctantlier... reluctanter? Reluctantest? He must convince a reluctant Wolverine to - F*ck. Synopses are so f*cking stupid.\"\n\nIn addition to Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman in the title roles, Deadpool and Wolverine will see Morena Baccarin (Vanessa), Leslie Uggams (Blind Al), Rob Delaney (Peter), Brianna Hildebrand (Negasonic Teenage Warhead) And Shioli Kutsuna (Yukio) return as their respective characters, and they'll be joined by franchise newcomers Emma Corrin (The Crown) and Matthew Macfadyen (Succession), who will play a TV agent and Charles Xavier's evil counterpart, Cassandra Nova.\n\nShawn Levy directs Deadpool and Wolverine from a script by Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Zeb Wells.\n\nThe movie is set to open in U.S. & Canadian theaters on July 26, and will be available in IMAX, RealD 3D, Dolby Cinema, 4DX, Cinemark XD and premium screens everywhere.

But just who is the furry friend that joins the Merc with a Mouth and the adamantium-clawed mutant on their mission to save the world?\n\nWell, in the movie, she's a Deadpool variant called Mary Poppins, is looked after by long-haired Ryan Reynolds, we mean Nicepool, in The Void, and is a member of the menacing The Deadpool Corps. In the comics, the pooch is a he, and their life is a little different...\n\nSpoilers for both Deadpool and Wolverine and the Deadpool comics below. If you don't want to know anything that happens in either, turn back now!\n\nRight, now that that's sorted, we can suggest you keep scrolling to find our breakdown of Dogpool's origins and comic history, from his brutal beginnings to his death (sob!) in issue #1 of Deadpool Kills Deadpool...\n\nIn the source material, Dogpool, or as they were known back then, Wilson, helmed from Earth-103173. He had a rough start in life, having been picked up off the streets and subjected to numerous, nasty experiments as part of Mascara-X's product testing. (Think the Weapon X project but overseen by Babeline, a cosmetics company that has promised its customers eternal youth).\n\nDue to this, the pooch wound up mutating, and gaining the ability to heal itself, much like Ryan Reynolds' Regenerating Degenerate.\n\nOne day, a particularly horrible trial left Wilson in such a terrible state that wicked scientists Dr. Von Braun and Eigor left his body in a dumpster behind their lab. But thanks to his newfound superpower, he was able to escape, and wound up being picked up by a local circus, adopting the name, \"Deadpool the Daredevil Dog\", and becoming their death-defying headline act.\n\nHe continued to perform for them until Earth-616's Deadpool, the sarcastic wise cracker we know and love, recruited him as a member of the Deadpool Corps, where he became good friends with Kidpool.\n\nDogpool's most notable appearances are in the following comics: Prelude to Deadpool Corps, Deadpool Corps, Deadpool Family and Deadpool. He also has a minor appearance in Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe and Deadpool vs Carnage.\n\nDeadpool 3 seems like the perfect film for the character to make its big screen debut, given that Wade Wilson welcomed them into the fold after they bested another of Braun's experiments, a vicious, superpowered dog he nicknamed Wolverine in battle.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amy_west@gamesradar.com", "name": "Amy West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_X", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weapon X"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earth-616"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/92pUUpnJuQxZkXz9BLzNvm-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

[Director] Shawn Levy... he and I had been sitting in the editing room and we called everybody at Disney and Marvel and said, 'We have to change the title.'\"\n\n\"We wouldn't take no for an answer,\" Reynolds recalled. \"We're like, 'We're changing the title. I will never call this movie Deadpool and Friend!' And they did it. They literally changed the title.\"\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine, starring Ryan Reynolds, Hugh Jackman, Emma Corrin and Matthew Macfadyen, is out now in the UK and will hit cinemas in the US on July 26. The movie will have a presence at San Diego Comic-Con as part of a bumper SDCC 2024 schedule.

On the convention's preview night, scores of fans were sporting clothing or costumes featuring the movie's characters.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who play the titular superheroes, will join director Shawn Levy in the San Diego Convention Center's famed Hall H Thursday. To prevent fans from camping out in lines all day to snag a seat, organizers created a lottery system for the chance to win tickets. The venue holds about 6,000 people.\n\nSome fans, conditioned to expect surprise guests and never-before-seen footage from years of experience at the convention, are speculating the panel will be followed by a screening of the film, which hits theaters Friday.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" marks the debut of Reynolds and Jackman's characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are the subject of several jokes throughout the trailer. Both Deadpool and Wolverine's characters existed in films previously under the 21st Century Fox banner.\n\nThe release comes at a time of increasing conversations about a general \"superhero fatigue,\" with audiences showing less enthusiasm for superhero movies both within the MCU and beyond. Part of that fatigue comes from a feeling that to understand a superhero movie today requires background research into the lore of the characters and comics, with much required viewing and reading.\n\nLevy said in an April interview with The Associated Press that he wanted to make sure his movie didn't require that intense level of preparation.\n\n\"I was a good student in school. I'll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,\" Levy said.\n\n\"I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn't want to presume that. This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research.\"\n\nAlthough Marvel is anxious for a hit following box-office underperformance in of \"The Marvels\" and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" in 2023, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is tracking to open in the $160 million range. That would unseat \"Inside Out 2\" for the biggest opening of the year -- and quash any discussion of superhero fatigue.\n\nWith generally positive reviews, rousing enthusiasm at Comic-Con and an endorsement from Taylor Swift where she called the film a \"joy portal,\" Marvel's latest movie is set to be a box-office hit.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

While Deadpool & Wolverine contains both a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene, audiences won't see any updates about the next Marvel installment at the end of the film. That's probably because the next few projects are a bit scattered across the vast multiverse that is the MCU. There's Agatha All Along this September, Captain America: Brave New World next February, Thunderbolts next May, and The Fantastic Four next July. As for the return of Wolverine or any of his Fox friends, we're likely looking way into the future.\n\nAs the credits roll, we catch Hugh Jackman suiting up as Wolverine for the first time. There's also a glimpse of a young Chris Evans and Jessica Alba during their days as members of Marvel's first family. We even see even some interviews from when Jackman and Reynolds first starred as Deadpool and Wolverine together in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Disney completed its acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019 -- and therefore allowed its Marvel characters to join the MCU -- so it's a classy move from the Deadpool & Wolverine team. 20th Century Fox gave us some damn good superhero films over the years. (X-Men: Days of Future Past, anyone?) It deserves the tribute.\n\nWhat About the Post-Credits Scene?\n\nWipe your tears, folks, because the post-credits scene is all laughs. Deadpool and Wolverine ate shawarma at the end of the film, so referencing The Avengers' post-credits scene is already checked off the list. Instead, Deadpool rolls back the tape to prove that he's not as deranged as he appears. As it turns out, he wasn't just throwing Johnny Storm under the bus when he insults Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). The Fantastic Four member really did say all that crazy stuff about her. What ensues is a hilarious, expletive-filled rant from Evans's Johnny. Honestly, it's simply a great reminder that Evans has serious comedy chops, too.\n\nI still wish we'd gotten a cameo from Marvel's other Johnny -- Johnny Blaze, aka Ghost Rider (Nicolas Cage) -- but beggars can't be choosers.

DCEU Man Of Steel's cameo in 'Deadpool & Wolverine' will shock you", "body": "***Spoilers ahead***\n\nEarlier this year, rumours of Henry Cavill being the new Wolverine in the Marvel Cinematic Universe did surface online but the flame of the unexpected speculation dimmed quickly. After Hugh Jackman, if there has to be a new Wolverine then recruiting DCEU's Man of Steel is the perfect choice, and Marvel turns this thought into reality in Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nThis Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman led film packs on cameos in abundance including one from the rival universe's superhero. Reynolds' The Merc With The Mouth is on a mission to save his universe from extinction. The convoluted storyline demands him to get help from Wolverine whom he calls \"The guy with fork for hands.\" While traveling through multiple realities, Reynolds meets various Wolverine versions. We see a dwarf Logan, angry Logan, one-eyed Logan, a Logan on a cross, and a Logan seemingly battling Hulk.\n\nSomewhere in these realities also appears a dashing Henry Cavill as the clawed-mutant. There's not much dialogue used as Cavill's superhero flicks Reynolds' Deadpool away in a swift move with his super strength. In that single moment, there's rage filled in Cavill's eyes indicating he isn't ready to sign up for whatever Reynolds' character asks of him.\n\nWhat's similar between Cavill and Jackman is their muscular build and carved physique that's not only pleasing to the eyes but also has people drooling. If in any reality, Marvel hires Cavill to play Wolverine again, I am in for the drama but that's just wishful thinking. His appearance in 'Deadpool & Wolverine' was just a moment's gimmick, that comes, entertains, and passes by. No plans of him leading Hugh Jackman's legacy have materialized in both real and fictional worlds.\n\nFinally in the plot, Deadpool finds a fitting partner in the worst version of a Wolverine, who's known in his reality for turning the entire world against the X-Men. They team up, battle each other sometimes, crack jokes, make audiences laugh and finally overcome the crisis together to emerge as the most-wanted Bromance goal of this year.\n\nDirected by Shawn Levy, Deadpool & Wolverine premieres on Friday, July 26.

However, Deadpool & Wolverine seems poised to take this tradition to new heights, leveraging its unique position as a bridge between Fox's late X-Men universe and the sprawling MCU.\n\nThe movie revolves around Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan (Hugh Jackman) journeying through the Multiverse. This concept leaves many doors open for surprising cameos and unexpected characters to return. Of course, the parade of cameos can only make sense if you know the previous Fox superhero projects and even behind-the-scenes trivia.\n\nChris Evans, known for his iconic portrayal of Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, first brought Johnny Storm/Human Torch to life in the 2005 film Fantastic Four and its 2007 sequel \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer. His charismatic performance as the cocky and impulsive Johnny Storm was widely praised, often considered the highlight of these films. In Deadpool & Wolverine, Evans makes a surprising return as the Human Torch, meeting a gruesome fate at the hands of Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). This cameo serves as a meta-commentary on Evans' superhero journey, bringing his pre-MCU character full circle and starkly contrasting his portrayal of the more strait-laced Steve Rogers.\n\nWunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15\n\nWunmi Mosaku first appeared as Hunter B-15 in the Disney+ series Loki. Her character evolved from a dedicated TVA agent to questioning the organization's true nature. In Deadpool & Wolverine, Mosaku reprises her role, now elevated to the position of TVA director. This promotion highlights B-15's growth and importance within the MCU. As the TVA director, B-15 can walk across different timelines, making her a key player for the entire Multiversal Saga.\n\nTyler Mane as Sabretooth\n\nTyler Mane first portrayed Victor Creed/Sabretooth in the original X-Men film in 2000. Mane brought a physically imposing presence to the feral mutant. In Deadpool & Wolverine, Mane reprises his role as Sabretooth, engaging in a highly anticipated duel with Wolverine. Despite the build-up, the confrontation ends hilariously anticlimactic, with Sabretooth losing his head. This cameo plays with audience expectations, subverting the typical superhero showdown trope.\n\nAaron Stanford as Pyro\n\nAaron Stanford first portrayed John Allerdyce/Pyro in X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). His portrayal of the fire-manipulating Mutant was notable for its complexity, showing Pyro's journey from Xavier's student to Magneto's acolyte. In Deadpool & Wolverine, Stanford returns as Pyro, now one of Cassandra Nova's main allies in the Void. However, his loyalties are divided as he works with Paradox behind Cassandra's back. This duplicitous role adds an extra layer of intrigue to the Void storyline.\n\nBlake Lively as Lady Deadpool\n\nBlake Lively, known for her roles in Gossip Girl and A Simple Favor, makes her superhero debut as Lady Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine. While initial speculation pointed to Taylor Swift for the role, it was confirmed that Lively, Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife, would don the red and black suit. In the movie, Lively leads an army of multiversal Deadpools, including quirky variants like Cowboy Deadpool, Baby Deadpool, and even a floating skeleton head Deadpool.\n\nHenry Cavill as Variant Wolverine\n\nHenry Cavill, best known for his portrayal of Superman in the DC Extended Universe and Geralt of Rivia in Netflix's The Witcher, makes a surprising appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine as an alternate universe version of Wolverine. Presented as the manliest Wolverine, Cavill's cameo is a meta nod to superhero casting. Wade Wilson even invites him to join the MCU, promising better treatment than \"other people\" (a playful jab at DC).\n\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan\n\nJon Favreau, who has played Happy Hogan in the MCU since 2008's Iron Man (2008), has a vital part to play in Deadpool & Wolverine. The film reveals that at the end of Deadpool 2, when Wade was traveling through timelines, he visited Happy Hogan for an interview to join the Avengers in the Sacred Timeline. Unfortunately for Wade, he doesn't get the job, which leads him to abandon the Deadpool uniform until the events of Deadpool 3. Happy's cameo provides a humorous connection to the broader MCU and offers a glimpse into Wade's attempts to join the Avengers, further emphasizing his outsider status within the superhero community.\n\nWesley Snipes as Blade\n\nWesley Snipes first brought Marvel's vampire hunter to life in the 1998 film Blade, kickstarting a trilogy that would pave the way for the modern superhero movie boom. Snipes' portrayal of the Daywalker was praised for its intensity and physicality, combining martial arts prowess with a brooding charisma. The Blade trilogy was a significant success for Marvel characters on the big screen before the advent of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, proving that superheroes could make big bucks in Hollywood. Snipes' return as Blade is worth homage to his contribution to the industry.\n\nDafne Keen as X-23\n\nDafne Keen made a powerful debut as Laura Kinney, also known as X-23, in the critically acclaimed Logan (2017). As the genetically engineered daughter of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, Keen's performance was praised for its emotional depth, especially considering her young age at the time of filming. Her portrayal of X-23 showcased a perfect blend of feral rage and vulnerability, effectively carrying on the legacy of the Wolverine character. Keen's appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine opens up intriguing possibilities for her future in the MCU, even more so as she finds a haven in Wade's original timeline.\n\nChanning Tatum as Gambit\n\nChanning Tatum's appearance as Gambit in Deadpool & Wolverine is a meta nod to one of the most famous unproduced superhero films of recent years. Tatum was attached to star as the charismatic Cajun mutant Remy LeBeau, aka Gambit, in a solo film for years, with the project going through multiple directors and rewrites before ultimately being canceled after Disney acquired Fox. His cameo in Deadpool & Wolverine, where he expresses confusion about ending up in the Void given that his timeline \"never even existed,\" is a playful acknowledgment of this Hollywood development hell story.\n\nJennifer Garner as Elektra\n\nJennifer Garner's return as Elektra is a surprising callback to the early 2000s era of Marvel films. Garner first portrayed the assassin Elektra Natchios in the 2003 Daredevil film alongside Ben Affleck, later headlining her own solo Elektra movie in 2005. While these films received mixed reviews, Garner's character portrayal was often praised. Her appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine as part of the team of Variants known as The Others in the Void serves as a nostalgic nod to this earlier period of Marvel adaptations, potentially giving the character a chance at redemption in the eyes of fans.\n\nOther Fox X-Men Characters\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine features many cameos from various Mutant characters from Fox's pre-Disney era, serving as a loving tribute to nearly two decades of X-Men films. These include appearances by Jason Flemyng as Azazel, Ray Park as Toad, Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike, and Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, among others. Each of these cameos provides a nostalgic touchpoint for long-time fans of the X-Men film franchise while also showcasing the vast potential of the Multiverse concept in bringing together different eras and iterations of beloved characters.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marco_vito_oddo@wegotthiscovered.com",

The Deadpool Corps was founded by the Earth-616 Deadpool when he was chosen to neutralize a cosmic entity called \"The Awareness\" which has been going around wrecking the multiverse's consciousness.\n\nDeadpool was chosen for this job because of his uniquely messed-up mind which keeps changing by the second which makes him completely immune to the entity. The main continuity Deadpool then went around the multiverse to recruit other versions of himself for this job which ultimately resulted in the formation of The Deadpool Corps. Usually, this team did not follow a hierarchy but the role of their leader was often taken up by 616 Deadpool or Lady Deadpool.\n\nHowever, soon enough Dreadpool, after killing the entire Marvel Universe set out to find his other variants with a team of other evil Deadpools. Some of his targets survived and warned Lady Deadpool who brought the Deadpool Corps together again. However, before they can get to their leader, the main continuity of Deadpool, they are intercepted by Dreadpool and his team and are massacred.\n\nSome members of the Corps survived and fought the evil Deadpools under 616 Deadpool's command. This was the end of Deadpool Corps since the main continuity Deadpool, or 616 Deadpool was the only surviving member of the team.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shashank_shakya@beebom.com", "name": "Shashank Shakya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth-616"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Deadpool-Corps-Explained.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

He came to Vox in 2014. Prior to that, he worked at the Atlantic.\n\nMajor spoiler alert: This post will absolutely ruin this movie for you. Please don't read this unless you have seen the movie or want to get spoiled.\n\nWhile the hoopla of Deadpool & Wolverine was all about the introduction of two iconic characters to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), the movie is also about saying goodbye.\n\nIn the film, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) faces the prospect of the collapse of his entire timeline, which has been destroyed by the death of Wolverine in 2017's Logan. To save it, he seeks out a still-living, alternate-universe version of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). But this new Wolvie has seen the rest of his X-Men die, and he can't stop blaming himself. Together, they're sent to the void (the same void that we see in Disney+'s Loki) where they sync up with an island of misfit toys: Marvel superheroes (mainly from Fox's filmography) that, for one reason or another, did not make it to Disney's promised land of perpetual intellectual property.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine's fictional conflict is a self-referential gag about Disney's real-life 2019 acquisition of Fox and its plethora of film rights, which includes some significant Marvel comic book characters. Reynolds's Deadpool is one of those superheroes, but he's currently the only actor playing a Marvel mutant slated to continue on and make the transition to Marvel Studios and the MCU. Having disposable superheroes of yore sent to the MCU trash heap is a meta way for Deadpool to make an inside joke about how Disney (and, to an extent, Marvel) now owns everything, including esoteric superhero nostalgia that you never knew existed and Deadpool himself.\n\nThey first meet the Fantastic Four's Johnny Storm (played by Chris Evans, reprising his pre-MCU role from 2005) who Deadpool mistakes for Captain America. All three are captured by the psychic villain Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin, playing an X-Men comic character we've never seen on film before). After Deadpool taunts her, as he taunts everyone, she telekinetically skins Storm alive before Deadpool and Wolverine make a miraculous, jetpack-fueled escape.\n\nThe duo eventually meet Storm's compatriots, who have been living in this suspended state for years. There's the half-human half-vampire Blade (Wesley Snipes, reprising his role from the Blade trilogy), ninja Elektra (Jennifer Garner, last seen in the 2005 Daredevil sequel of the same name), murder clone X-23 (Dafne Keen, who appeared with Jackman in 2017's Logan), and mutant energy wielder Gambit (Channing Tatum, finally playing the part Disney's Fox acquisition supposedly made impossible). Faced with an eternity of storytelling purgatory, the forgotten heroes team up with their new friends to help the two get back to Deadpool's main timeline. The misfits break into Cassandra's lair, drawing the attention of her henchmen and allowing the bosom buddies to take on Cassandra.\n\nAt the end of the film, Deadpool and Wolverine dispatch Nova as well as Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen), the Time Variance Authority (TVA) middle manager who sent them to the void in the first place. They save Deadpool's collapsing timeline and return home. Blade and the gang are rewarded by getting restored to their own timelines, mainly off-screen. Everything's squared away and our ambiguously coupled duo get to be friends happily ever after.\n\nAnd one post-credits scene can't change that ... or can it?\n\nThere's one scene that happens at the end of Deadpool & Wolverine's credits scroll.\n\nIn it, we find Deadpool at the TVA headquarters. As established in Loki, the TVA are essentially cops who watch every parallel timeline in the multiverse and make sure nothing goes sideways. Also established in Loki -- and so many Marvel movies that deal with the splintering multiverse -- the TVA are susceptible to serious goofs. (Frankly, they aren't very good at their job.) They're also an authoritarian agency that imposes their will on these timelines and the countless people who live within them, so you don't have to feel bad for them when they mess up.\n\nDeadpool breaks the fourth wall; he wants to clear something up. Although he insulted Cassandra Nova and blamed it on Johnny Storm, he says he isn't responsible for Storm's death, even though it seemed like he was. He claims that he simply repeated what Storm told them when they were captured.\n\nTo prove his point, he rewinds TVA surveillance footage and shows us what really happened. Sure enough, Johnny Storm unleashes a cuss-filled, raunch-heavy monologue -- delivered in Evans's native Boston accent, no less -- that includes references to fellatio, analingus, Juggernaut secretions, and derogatory comments about Cassandra's baldness. He tells Deadpool that he can repeat it but would risk being skinned alive if he did because she is so beyond awful. The merc with a mouth is innocent!\n\nPerhaps more importantly, he apparently has access to TVA HQ and ostensibly its timeline-jumping technology. By the logic and structure of this convoluted universe, that means Deadpool might be able to show up and snark in any MCU property (which, obviously, Marvel wants you to know). For now, though, he's just content to show you Chris Evans saying absolutely filthy things.", "source": {"uri": "vox.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vox"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Curiosity has peaked leading up to the big launch, leaving fans excited about potential future developments. The post-credits scene, a staple of Marvel movies, has always provided hints and teases for what's next in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nFor those wondering about the Deadpool & Wolverine end-credits scene and its implications, here is everything you need to know.\n\nWhat happens in the final Deadpool & Wolverine post-credits scene?\n\nPrior to the post-credits scene, a montage featuring behind-the-scenes clips from previous Fox Marvel movies plays. Then, after the credits, a scene plays out linking back to an earlier gag in the movie.\n\nFox Marvel behind-the-scenes montage\n\nDuring the credits of Deadpool & Wolverine, a heartfelt montage set to the \"Good Riddance\" song by Green Day plays. It showcases behind-the-scenes clips from various X-Men movies, ranging from The Last Stand to Dark Phoenix.\n\nIt includes Ryan Reynolds discussing his desire to play Deadpool, Jennifer Garner suiting up as Elektra, and several other lighthearted moments with the cast. This highlights iconic Fox characters and actors, celebrating the X-Men franchise's legacy while acknowledging its transition into the MCU.\n\nJohnny Storm's post-credits scene\n\nThe post-credits scene in Deadpool & Wolverine takes an unexpected turn. Instead of hinting at future Marvel movies, it humorously resolves an earlier plot point. Throughout the movie, Deadpool claims that Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) made terrible comments about Cassandra Nova, leading to Johnny's death.\n\nThese crude remarks seemed out of character for Chris Evans, who previously played Captain America and is famous for his \"language!\" line. This made viewers suspect Deadpool fabricated the comments to save himself.\n\nIn the post-credits scene, Deadpool returns to the TVA to clear his name. He presents a tape showing a conversation between Johnny Storm, Deadpool, and Wolverine, all tied up in a prisoner transport pod on their way to Cassandra Nova. The recording reveals Johnny Storm actually saying every horrible thing Deadpool claimed, delivering each insult with unsettling naturalness.\n\nThis revelation provides a laugh-out-loud moment, confirming that Deadpool wasn't lying and adding a comedic twist to end the film on a high note.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anubhav_chaudhry@comingsoon.net", "name": "Anubhav Chaudhry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dark Phoenix Saga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Credit_and_Collection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Credit and Collection", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Demoscene", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Demoscene", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Deadpool-Wolverine-End-Credits.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Two cops. One brain. All balls.\"\n\nAlpha Cop would then have hit theaters and, five minutes in, switch over to Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\n\"The original idea with this movie was to shoot a fake movie called Alpha Cop that was intentionally bad,\" Reynolds said. \"I even had one of the posters made. It was about two guys who were sharing one brain, and together they make the ultimate cop. And the poster says: 'Alpha Cop. Two cops. One brain.

Five minutes into the movie the Marvel logo would flip up and it would actually be Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nObviously, the Alpha Cop idea didn't end up happening, but it's fun to imagine people sitting down to watch what they thought was going to be a terrible buddy cop movie only to find out they were watching Deadpool & Wolverine instead.

She even fueled speculation by attending the world premiere in a Deadpool-esque red catsuit, teasing her role.\n\nWhat does Blake Lively's Lady Deadpool look like under the mask?\n\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine, Blake Lively voices Lady Deadpool, who stays masked throughout the film. As a result, the film does not reveal her appearance under the mask. However, it's assumed that she looks like Blake Lively.\n\nIn the comics, Lady Deadpool is initially portrayed as a female version of Deadpool, sharing features like cancer scars. However, her appearance evolves over time. Recent depictions show her free from scars and with perfect blonde hair, unlike Wade Wilson, who is often bald.\n\nThe decision to keep Lady Deadpool masked in the movie aligns with her comic book portrayal, where her identity remains ambiguous. This approach preserves the mystery and continuity of her character, while Blake Lively's voice adds depth to the role.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anubhav_chaudhry@comingsoon.net", "name": "Anubhav Chaudhry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mystery fiction"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice_Actors", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Voice Actors", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Telephony", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Telephony", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Speech_Technology/Voice_Portals", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Speech Technology/Voice Portals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Masks", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Deadpool-Wolverine-lady-deadpool.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

It has certainly been a while since I've walked away smiling from a superhero film. But if Batman from The Dark Knight in 2008 could be adopted by conservatives in an election year as a masked metaphor in support of George W Bush and the \"war on terror\", Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024 stands as an antidote to the misery of Trumpism.\n\nStick with me. This is a mad ride and carries a spoiler.\n\nLike politics, the storytelling in Marvel movies has broken in recent years - literally splintered into a gazillion bizarre threads of a \"multiverse\".\n\nIn some of these many worlds, red means go, up means down. Logic is impossible. Any character can be killed off, only to be plucked from another timeline to make a triumphant return. Alternative facts are the rule.\n\nIn this film, Deadpool pokes fun at this post-truth world. He winks knowingly at previous flops in which Marvel has over-reached. It's pop culture, not politics, with a coarse humour that exposes absurdity.\n\nWhereas the superhero movies of 2016 delivered an emphasis on relationship breakdowns, the title and theme of this movie, Deadpool AND Wolverine, imply finding a way together.\n\nWolverine is himself a resurrected hero. In one world he is dead, as he was left in 2017's Logan, with the inspiring legacy of ultimate self sacrifice. In this movie, Deadpool literally digs up Wolverine's skeletal remains to beat his enemies. Talk about an image to portray the modern abuses of history.\n\nThen Wolverine is brought back to life, drawn from a parallel universe. This version of Wolverine went missing at a time of dire need. He sees the chance to undo the mistakes of the past, to wave a magic wand of redemption. Only suffering and bitter experience, he is reminded at the end, give him the strength of character to do what is needed.\n\nI saw a story of politics. That easy fixes are not the answer and testing times have a value in and of themselves. Of course I'm projecting. Deadpool is not Donald any more than Wolverine is Kamala. But together the arc of these characters struck me as a collective experience of the past few years.\n\nDeadpool is the ultimate gaslighter; his lies have deadly consequences. Wolverine is a grumpy nostalgic who regards Deadpool as the worst person he's met in more than 200 years. They fight. They punch and stab and shoot one another in the most absurd ways. But their superpower is that neither can die. They are stuck together. Only by cooperating can they win.\n\nWhereas the superhero movies of 2016 delivered Captain America: Civil War and Batman v Superman, with an emphasis on relationship breakdowns (note the year of release, when Trump prevailed over Hillary Clinton), the title and theme of this movie, Deadpool AND Wolverine, imply finding a way together.\n\nThe film is interspersed with cameo appearances and feel-good moments that serve as a reminder of happier times, not as answers to suggest the ultimate dominance of one side over the other. They are more a sentimental fix to the universe, harking back to a time when people laughed more along with the ride.", "source": {"uri": "lowyinstitute.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lowy Institute for International Policy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shared universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

We may have seen Cassandra Nova, Sabretooth, and X-23 already, but the Void contained so much more for Marvel fans, from the obscure to the obvious, and everything in between.\n\nBut one of the biggest cameos in the movie was exciting not because of who appeared, but because of who didn't appear -- and it could be teasing an even bigger cameo in the future.\n\nWarning! Spoilers for Deadpool & Wolverine ahead!\n\nWhen Deadpool and Wolverine are fighting each other in the Void from Loki Season 1, a third party suddenly enters to mediate. \"You fight each other in the Wasteland, we all lose,\" he says. At first, it's difficult to see who this figure is, but as a posse of bad guys roll up on apocalyptic cars, he jumps down and we get a better look.\n\nDeadpool is excited, and for good reason: when this figure lowers his hood, he's none other than Chris Evans, the man who saved the world during the Time Heist and wielded Thor's Hammer. Or rather, it's the actor who did all that. Despite Deadpool's excitement, this isn't the return of Steve Rogers that fans have been demanding. He may be wearing a blue and white suit, but when he gets ready to say his catchphrase, he says \"Flame on,\" igniting and shooting off into the sky.\n\nThat's right -- Chris Evans isn't reprising the role of Steve Rogers, but Johnny Storm from the 2005 movie Fantastic Four, one of the Fox-era pre-MCU Marvel movies Deadpool & Wolverine pays constant homage to.\n\nThis isn't a huge surprise if you've been keeping up with Chris Evans' post-Marvel career. He's collaborated with Ryan Reynolds and director Shawn Levy before in Free Guy, and the choice to reprise Johnny Storm is actually something he's considered before. In 2022, MTV asked if he'd ever go back to that role again, and said it would actually be an \"easier sell\" than returning as Cap. \"Cap is so precious to me. And you know, I almost don't wanna disrupt what a beautiful experience that was,\" he said. \"But Johnny Storm, I feel like he didn't really get his day. That was before Marvel really found its footing.\"\n\nJohnny Storm's cameo is also an homage to the X-Men and Fantastic Four crossover that never happened. For years, 20th Century Fox had planned to crossover its X-Men franchise with the Fantastic Four, with a movie being penned by Zack Stenz and Ashley Edward Miller, that would've also featured Deadpool and Daredevil. Alas, the crossover movie never came to be. But at least we have Deadpool & Wolverine to make up for it.\n\nThe cameo also doesn't undo Steve Rogers' touching sendoff in Avengers: Endgame -- nor does it completely erase the possibility of Cap coming back even after his mantle has been passed down to Sam Wilson. In an interview with DiscussingFilm, Marvel president Kevin Feige said Deadpool and Wolverine actually may have proven those kinds of cameos are still possible. \"I think Hugh's appearance and starring role in [Deadpool & Wolverine] is a great sign that it can be done -- if great care is taken,\" he said.\n\nSo America's ass may be back on the big screen, it's just on fire this time. Hopefully, the next time we see this Chris in the MCU, it will be in the red, white, and blue fans have been waiting for.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Guy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free Guy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(presenter)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (presenter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catchphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catchphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Wilson_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Wilson (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Miller_(screenwriter)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashley Miller (screenwriter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MTV"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/24/f1badac7/deadpool-wolverine-1.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Those marks include the highest domestic opening of 2024 and the biggest debut ever for an R-rated film.\n\nDisney and Pixar's \"Inside Out 2\" is currently the highest opener of the year at $154.2 million and the first \"Deadpool\" film's $132.4 million debut is the highest for any R-rated feature, according to data from Comscore.\n\n\"I think no question this is going to open as the largest R-rated movie of all time,\" said Mike Bowers, president and CEO of Harkins Theatres, a theater chain based in Arizona. \"And it's already one of the top presale movies historically for us.\"\n\n\"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is the 34th film to be released under the MCU banner and the first to garner an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association. The previous two Deadpool films, both rated R, were produced and released through 20th Century Fox. Disney acquired the company in 2019, bringing the X-Men and Fantastic Four back into the larger Marvel portfolio.\n\nLike previous entries in the MCU, \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is benefitting from fan fervor. Audiences are eager to see the flick in its opening weekend in order to avoid spoilers. Disney has kept much of the film's content secret and provided limited press screenings prior to its debut.\n\nAnd Bowers expects audiences will keep coming back for more in the weeks after the film's opening.\n\n\"This is a film that there's so much happening, so many jokes and funny sequences that no one's gonna be able to eat just one, you know, they're gonna be back,\" he said.\n\nEllis Jacob, president and CEO of Cineplex, the largest movie theater chain in Canada, echoed Bower's thoughts. Jacob said \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is filled with Easter eggs and audiences will return to try and see them all.\n\nHe also noted that many of those moviegoers are buying tickets for premium screenings, like IMAX, Dolby and ScreenX, which come at higher prices.\n\nMarvel has also collaborated with movie theaters to license merchandise like collectible popcorn buckets and drink containers that cinema operators expect will sell quickly. Concessions have always been the biggest money maker for theaters, and having limited edition items can drive even higher food and beverage sales.\n\nOf course, \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is also an important release for the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has \"eased off the gas pedal\" and planned fewer releases in the series that drove the global box office for more than a decade, said Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. He said Disney is trying to right the ship after a series of theatrical missteps and poor box office hauls, as well as an deluge of streaming content that overcrowded the market and overwhelmed even the MCU's biggest fans.\n\n\"Ultimately, as much as this is a Marvel movie, it may be viewed equally as a midsummer action comedy that stars personalities and brands that die-hard fans and casual viewers love,\" said Robbins. \"Reynolds and Jackman are a grand slam duo given their respective pop culture presences and friendly back-and-forth across social media and interviews. There's also a genuine curiosity about how the MCU's first R-rated film will play out and hold to the qualities which made the first two Deadpool films and [Jackman's 2017 Wolverine film] 'Logan' so popular.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandango_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandango Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comscore", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comscore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkins_Theatres", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harkins Theatres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScreenX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ScreenX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineplex_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cineplex Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.nbcmiami.com/2024/07/108011558-1721882353958-deadpool_wolverine_Cropped.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Created by Rob Liefeld and introduced in an issue scripted by Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool was a not-so-subtle riff on Deathstroke the Terminator from DC Comics, right down to borrowing the secret identity -- DC's Slade Wilson inspired the Marvel character's name, Wade Wilson. Deadpool looked cool, but had little attitude to distinguish him from any other tough-guy hired killer.\n\nFast-forward thirty years later, and Deadpool has become not just one of the most popular characters in comics fandom, but also one of the most popular superheroes, period. Ryan Reynolds has embodied the smart-mouth, fourth-wall-breaking antihero so successfully that Deadpool & Wolverine has become one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, one that Marvel is hoping will reverse the trend of superhero fatigue.\n\nBut Deadpool's journey from unremarkable supporting character to pop culture's most self-aware stinker since Bugs Bunny didn't first happen on the screen. It happened in the comics, where writers such as Joe Kelly, Christopher Priest, and Gail Simone made Wade so much more than a dull, derivative killer.\n\nAnyone interested in seeing how Deadpool became the Merc with a Mouth, or want a few great Wolverine stories, would do well to check out these comics.\n\nThe New Mutants began as a spin-off of Uncanny X-Men, introducing a new class of adolescents recruited by Professor Charles Xavier after the mainline X-Men appeared to die in action. The stories written by Chris Claremont and Louise Simonson made the book a fan favorite. But despite some great characters and acclaimed runs, the book's sales flagged, at least until artist Rob Liefeld came on board.\n\nAs readers thrilled to Liefeld's high-octane, if fundamentally unsound, artwork, sales turned around. The popularity made Liefeld the main creative on the book, which he used to introduce new characters regularly, both in The New Mutants and its followup series X-Force. Given the frequency of new characters, many of similar styles and attitudes, Deadpool has little to distinguish him in his first appearance, where he's simply a hired killer who gets involved with the New Mutants and their leader, Cable. But Deadpool garnered enough interest to merit additional appearances, which allowed other writers to flesh him out.\n\nDespite what the press tour for Deadpool & Wolverine suggests, Deadpool is more of a Spider-Man fanboy in the comics. After all, just look at the costume he chose! That said, Wade and Logan do have a long history of clashes and team-ups, starting with 1994's Wolverine #88, written by the incomparable Larry Hama, penciled by Adam Kubert and Fabio Laguna, inked by Mark Farmer and Tim Townsend, colored by Marie Javins, and lettered by Pat Brosseau.\n\nHama's Wolverine run featured surprisingly well-observed character moments and over-the-top action, but \"It's D-D-Deadpool, Folks\" put the latter over the former. The light plot finds Deadpool and Wolverine crossing paths while in pursuit, Wolverine of a former colleague called Weapon X and Deadpool of his ex-girlfriend, Vanessa. Despite the flimsy motivations, Wolverine #88 features non-stop action, as the two assailants put their healing factors to the test, hacking and slashing at each other with anything they can find.\n\nFabian Nicieza began fleshing out Deadpool's sense of humor even while scripting Liefeld's pages, but no writer did more to establish the character's personality than Joe Kelly, who wrote several issues of Wade's first ongoing series. Although he only made a single off-hand metatextual joke during his run, telling the assassin Bullseye the issue number when they last met, Kelly transformed Deadpool into a tragic figure with a non-stop exterior monologue.\n\nThat characterization appears from the beginning of the series, in which Deadpool becomes an agent for a mysterious organization. With the help of his friend, the inventor Weasel, Deadpool takes the job out of the usual desire for cash but finds himself becoming sympathetic to those harmed by his missions. Kelly achieves the balance of mayhem and merriment through Ed McGuinness's cartoonish but clean character work, inked by Nathan Massengill and Norman Lee, colored by Chris Lichtner, and lettered by Richard Starkings and Dave Lanphear.\n\nBy the end of Joe Kelly's run on Deadpool, most of Wade's personality had been established. But Deadpool didn't start breaking the fourth wall until the short but excellent run by new writer Christopher Priest. Working with penciler Paco Diaz, inker Rodney Ramos, colorist Shannon Blanchard, and letterer Richard Starkings, Priest added the final missing piece to Deadpool, making him the hit he is today.\n\n\"Chapter X\" serves as both a recap and redirection for the Merc With a Mouth. Deadpool spends nearly all of the story trapped in a tank, where he suffers changes in reality, starting with his own body becoming elastic. As things grow worse, Deadpool assures himself that \"None of this is actually happening,\" blaming everything on a \"man with a typewriter.\" Once Thor's brother Loki gets involved, Deadpool sees things clearly and knows that he's in a comic book, changing his personality forever.\n\nAs reimagined by writer Rick Remender and artist Jerome Opena, Uncanny X-Force operated as the black ops wing of the X-Men, doing the dirty deeds that the mainline heroes couldn't do. In the first arc The Apocalypse Solution, X-Force takes on one of the most daring quests, killing the newly resurrected En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse. But when Apocalypse comes back in a different form than expected, X-Force's resolve gets tested.\n\nAt first, Deadpool seems like an odd inclusion on the team, and not just because he isn't technically a mutant. Rather, Deadpool's constant banter makes him a strange fit in a darker team on a secret mission. Remender manages to balance the two tones, helping Deadpool work alongside complex characters like Psylocke and Archangel without sacrificing his sense of humor. Nothing demonstrates this balance better than a shocking scene in which Deadpool does the unthinkable to save Archangel from starvation.\n\nFew stories divide fans like Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe, written by Cullen Bunn and illustrated by Dalibor Talajic. After a psychic attack goes horribly wrong, Deadpool's fourth-wall breaking goes to extremes, turning him nihilistic and sadistic. True to its title, Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe depicts Wade killing all of the Marvel heroes without mercy or even joy. The book opens with him slaughtering the Fantastic Four and just goes on from there, far past the boundaries of good taste.\n\nMany have complained that Deadpool only succeeds in his rampage because Bunn writes Marvel heroes out of character. But anyone going to Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe for consistent canon has already lost. Instead, the comic is best understood as an alternate reality thought exercise, imagining what it would look like if Deadpool got to kill all the heroes.\n\nIn \"Dead Presidents,\" Wade Wilson faces one of his most devious enemies: Richard Nixon. Tricky Dick hasn't come back to the land of the living alone. He's brought along every other former President who has shuffled off the mortal coil. The resurrected executives come courtesy of a disgruntled SHIELD agent with a superweapon. Free of any sense of reverence that would stay his hand, Wade jumps into action, sending the leaders of the free world back to Hell.\n\n\"Dead Presidents\" inaugurated one of the best and wackiest Deadpool runs of all time, written by Gerry Duggan and comedian Brian Posehn. Along with illustrator Tony Moore, colorist Val Staples, and letterer Joe Sabino, the writers embrace the storytelling possibilities offered by Deadpool's irreverent and over-the-top nature. \"Dead Presidents\" is the type of adventure that only Deadpool could have, for better or for worse.\n\nThe original Secret Wars crossover from 1984 was one of Marvel Comics's first major events, but it isn't particularly great. Designed in part to sell action figures, Secret Wars mostly consists of good guys and bad guys engaging in meaningless fights and nothing more. In other words, it's the perfect sort of story for Deadpool to invade and disrupt.\n\nWritten by Cullen Bunn, illustrated by Matteo Lolli, colored by Ruth Redmond, and lettered by Joe Sabino, Deadpool's Secret Wars retells the original story, this time with Deadpool added. The story hits the same major beats, just with Wade's one-liners and fourth-wall breaks to add humor to the otherwise dull plotting. Even better, the creative team tells a compelling and surprisingly moving tale that explains why Wade wasn't in the version we read decades ago.\n\nFrom the first trailers, Deadpool & Wolverine promised to be not just a team-up between the titular characters, but also a fond farewell to the 20th Century Fox superhero movies and Wade's inauguration into the MCU. These high stakes threaten to overwhelm the simple pleasures of seeing Deadpool work alongside Wolverine. More specifically, a Wolverine overwhelmed with guilt after failing to save his loved ones in his universe.\n\nIf Deadpool & Wolverine loses the plot in its multiversal adventure, at least we'll have Deadpool vs. Old Man Logan, a five-issue miniseries written by Declan Shalvey, illustrated by Mike Henderson, colored by Lee Loughridge, and lettered by Joe Sabino. Even though it co-stars an elderly Wolverine thrown back in time to the present, Deadpool vs. Old Man Logan keeps things simple and brutal. The two titular blade wielders try to save a young mutant from falling into the hands of duplicitous SHIELD agents, at least when they aren't trying to kill one another. Shalvey's lean plot leaves plenty of space for Henderson's sharp and expressive figure work, making for a pleasingly straightforward read.\n\nThe cover of 2022's Wolverine #23 recreates the cover of Wolverine #88 from decades earlier, with the robotic baddie Danger impaling both Wolverine and Deadpool instead of just Deadpool stabbing Wolverine. Lest anyone call out the later comic as a rip-off, keep in mind that both images come from illustrator Adam Kubert, who returned to the characters as the regular artist on the latest Wolverine ongoing.\n\nDespite the consistent visuals, much has changed for both leads. Not only is Deadpool far more popular in 2022 than he was in 1994, but Wolverine is now a citizen of Krakoa, a sovereign nation only for mutants. Krakoa dominated X-Men stories from 2019 to earlier this year, and \"Old Haunts\" is no different. Kubert and writer Benjamin Percy, colorist Frank Martin, and letterer Cory Petit send Deadpool to hassle Wolverine for an invitation to Krakoa (despite the fact that he isn't a mutant), leading to yet another reluctant team-up.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series",

But before they can save the world, will they end up killing each other?\n\nReview: Deadpool has always been known for his wisecracks and witty comebacks, but this time, Ryan Reynolds (also a co-writer) takes it up several notches, making this Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) tentpole a riotous affair. His comedic punches are even more impactful than the physical ones, both of which land with an impact.\n\nDirector Shawn Levy, hailed by many as the saviour of the MCU's troubled fortunes, delivers a self-aware, self-deprecating gag fest from the very first scene. This franchise outing spares no one, poking fun at everything - from Disney's takeover of Fox to Hugh Jackman's seemingly eternal association with the franchise as Wolverine. Even Captain America and Mad Max aren't safe from Deadpool's relentless jabs. It's a no-holds-barred chaotic comedy that pulls out all the stops, and we are definitely not complaining.\n\nThe plot is straightforward yet engaging: one insanely powerful enemy against two superheroes, one of whom is desperate to become an Avenger. Deadpool's world, consisting of the nine people he truly cares about, is in danger, and to save it, he ropes in a variant of the late James 'Logan' Howlett or the Wolverine. Logan, now stuck with Deadpool's incessant chatter, finds himself in the Void, facing the formidable villain Cassandra Nova (Emma-Louise Corrin) alongside a slew of other superheroes, leading to bloody battles and relentless action.\n\nRyan Reynolds is the heartbeat of this movie. We expect Deadpool to be unfiltered and offensive, but Reynolds elevates it to another level. His relentless banter fuels the madness of this installment, making it clear that Deadpool is an equal-opportunity offender. Reynolds' unhinged portrayal of Deadpool is a testament to the franchise's desperate need for a course correction. The film shatters the fourth wall and even takes on the fans, with Deadpool addressing them as nerds and making cheeky comments about their \"special sock\" for the most anticipated fight scenes. This back-to-basics approach reminds us that at its core, this franchise is based on a comic book after all and should never have been more complicated.\n\nHugh Jackman plays it cool as Wolverine, but his character shows signs of weariness, which Deadpool humorously addresses by suggesting the MCU will keep Jackman in the role until he's 90. Jackman takes the joke in his stride, and their on-screen chemistry flows organically. The mindless banter, sexual innuendos, and tension amid the bromance are complemented by intense action and bloodshed. There's enough and more of it, but one wonders when to really feel worried about any of the characters because almost everyone is always immortal. Well almost. The film boasts spectacular visuals typical of a big-screen outing, and at just over two hours, it seldom feels like a drag. There are many noteworthy cameos, but we aren't the ones to give spoilers of any kind. Emma Corrin stands out as the evil Cassandra Nova, her petite frame belying the raw power she wields.\n\nWhether you're a fan or not, 'Deadpool & Wolverine' keeps you engaged with its constant stream of action and humor. It helps to be familiar with the legacy characters and storyline (as messy and complicated as it may be) to fully appreciate the experience, especially when watching it with an enthusiastic audience. 'Deadpool & Wolverine' breaks barriers and goes where other MCU films haven't, capturing nostalgia, humour, and most importantly, delivering oodles of entertainment. This is exactly what the franchise needs to stay relevant and enjoyable.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ronak_kotecha@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Ronak Kotecha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mad Max"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Corrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Corrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immortality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immortality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Franchising", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/msid-112009734/112009734.jpg?17082", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Ahead of the release, one of the big questions on fans's minds was the matter of who might be drafted in to play Lady Deadpool, a female variant of the superhero who had long been confirmed to be making an appearance.\n\nThere were all sorts of suggestions as to who might be playing her - with some fans even speculating that pop superstar Taylor Swift could be taking on the role.\n\nWell, now that the film is out, the identity of the character has been revealed - read on for everything you need to know.\n\nWho plays Lady Deadpool in Deadpool & Wolverine?\n\nIn the end, it's Blake Lively who takes on the role of Lady Deadpool. Of course, this isn't too much of a surprise - the former Gossip Girl star has been married to Ryan Reynolds since 2012, and so it makes perfect sense that she would be involved in the film.\n\nIndeed, Lively had been one of the most commonly identified stars when fans were guessing who might play the role, so plenty of people will feel vindicated about their predictions.\n\nDespite her appearance in the film - which comes when Wade Wilson and Logan are confronted by a huge army of Deadpool variants - we never actually sees Lively's face, as she is wearing her mask the entire time.\n\nHer identity is therefore not revealed until the credits - and it turns out she's not the only big name hiding behind a Deadpool mask in that scene.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is credited as playing Cowboy Deadpool, and although we don't see his face, we do briefly hear his distinctive Southern drawl.\n\nBut both those big stars are upstaged by one Deadpool variant who seems destined to emerge from the film as its breakout star: Peggy the Dog, who plays Dogpool.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_cremona@radiotimes.com", "name": "Patrick Cremona", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Lively", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blake Lively"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_Girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gossip Girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Stars", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Drama", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2024/07/Lady-Deadpool-68da5fd.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

But no argue the fact that Deadpool 3 will be the best of the franchise as it involves Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and the trailers have already revealed the onscreen chemistry he will share with the foul-mouthed Deadpool. On top of everything, Deadpool & Wolverine also features a female counterpart of our lead hero. Let's find out who is the female Deadpool aka Lady Deadpool.\n\nWho Is Female Deadpool\n\nFemale Deadpool's real name is Wanda Wilson, and she belongs to the alternate reality Earth-3010. She's a mercenary who will take up even the toughest assignments for money. Additionally, Wanda Wilson is known for her never-ending love for junk food and television (She's basically me....if, of course, you take out the superhero part).\n\nWhen Earth-3010 became a victim of fascism, and everyone was forced to spend their lives as per the government, Congress and the top generals got split. Some states also started seeking independence. This is when we get to truly know the heavily scarred Lady Deadpool, who stands against General America's troop of loyalists in Washington D.C. This wasn't their first meeting, though, as Wanda Wilson and General America had crossed paths before. The latter had his right arm mutilated in the conflict.\n\nGeneral America already had to settle his old score with Lady Deadpool, and luckily, he got the chance the second time. However, before he can harm Wanda, Deadpool from Earth-616 shows up and helps her to knock out General America. After that, O.G. Deadpool reveals his plan to save the Multiverse to Wanda, and without thinking even for a minute, she agrees.\n\nLady Deadpool Joins the Deadpool Corps\n\nThe Contemplator chose our favorite Deadpool, Wade Wilson, to hire the Deadpools from different alternate worlds and build a Deadpool Corps that will fight against consciousness-absorbing Awareness. As instructed, Deadpool of Earth-616 hires Kidpool, Headpool, Dogpool, and, of course, Lady Deadpool. However, the chosen ones must prove their worthiness in front of the Elders to become the official members of the Corps.\n\nThe fight began, and the female Deadpool eventually killed the enemy with her sword. Following the win, the Elders rewarded each member of the Corps with a ring. The special gifts allowed the Corps to summon any Elder of the universe and ask them for their help with whatever they wanted. Besides that, the Elders also gave them their ship, Bea Arthur.\n\nAs part of the Deadpool Corps, Lady Deadpool and the other members had to travel to different realities to fight the evil forces. The Corps fought their final battle with the Evil Deadpool Corps and sacrificed their lives in the process.\n\nWanda Wilson, Aka. Lady Deadpool's incredible healing factor makes her look similar to Wolverine. She can heal any wound within seconds and can even regrow the missing body parts with a quick speed. The healing factor also helps her brain cells to work more efficiently than any other human. It also enhances her immunity and protects Lady Deadpool from infections and diseases.\n\n2. Immune to Poison\n\nIt's quite challenging for the enemies to drug and intoxicate Wanda as her body is resistant to most of the drugs and poisons. However, we can't say she cannot be intoxicated ever as drugs such as tranquilizers can affect her if given in heavy dosages.\n\n3. Superhuman Strength\n\nLady Deadpool can perform any physical activity for several days without getting tired, even for a bit. Her agility, reflexes, and bodily coordination make her superior even to the athletes.\n\nWho Plays Lady Deadpool in the Deadpool 3\n\nEvery Deadpool fan has been waiting for the big reveal of the actress behind the Lady Deadpool.

Lucky for everyone, Marvel wanted the Merc with the Mouth back in the fold and now that they're under the same umbrella, the door is open for the inclusion of even more of the studio's superheroes and villains - a previous failing Deadpool was unafraid of calling out. However, those many possibilities were nearly a moot point once the greatest wish on fans' lips and most anticipated team-up was finally confirmed: Marvel Studios presents Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nWade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is not in a great place in his life, but a hero answers the call when he's needed... or at least that's what he's heard. So, when the TVA comes knocking on his door and it turns out not to be for the many times he messed with the timeline, no one is more shocked than Wade. However, what Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) tells him convinces him it's time to squeeze back into the red suit, so Deadpool can save the world - no joke. But first, he needs to find Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) because the plan doesn't work without him.\n\nThe series' soundtracks are always great, pairing unexpected classics with ultra-violent scenes. However, this movie arguably features the best opening credit sequence to a superhero movie, redefining everyone's first reference when they hear the selected NSYNC hit from this day forward. It's fast-paced, high-energy and an excellent way to set the tone for the franchise's second sequel. The picture then has no choice but to deaccelerate a bit, bringing the focus back to the narrative and Deadpool's quest to save the world. Yet, it still doesn't miss an opening for a pop culture reference, the chance to curse or an opportunity to poke fun at its new parent company. It also delivers the R-rated Wolverine dialogue fans always knew was lurking beneath the surface of the PG scripts.\n\nWhile the movie continues to offer its treasured brand of off-colour heroism, the one thing that sets this chapter apart from its predecessors are the cameos. As Deadpool previously noted, they could only afford the lower value Marvel characters prior to the merge. Now, there are recognizable actors and characters sprinkled throughout the film, reviving many personalities from earlier movies, including some very exciting and unexpected faces. Though the best guest appearances come in the latter half of the picture, reintroducing long-gone yet beloved superheroes and reconfirming some ideas are better left never reaching audiences.\n\nThe narrative also feels different from previous movies. Although it still centres on a personal journey - Wade rediscovering his self-confidence and Logan's search for redemption - it lacks the off-the-wall quality of the other films, which is likely because of the lack of variety in the story's isolated location. However, this does allow for almost all of the focus to be placed on the first-time (and hopefully not the last) team-up between Deadpool and Wolverine. Being each other's complete opposites, they're in constant conflict, leading to them repeatedly stabbing each other on more than occasion, including an epic fight in a very confined space.

If you buy something through this post, the publisher may get a share of the sale.\n\nRyan Reynolds has revealed one discarded plan for Deadpool & Wolverine that would surely have shocked cinemagoers had it ever become reality.\n\nSpeaking on the First We Feast YouTube channel, Deadpool actor Reynolds said the original idea for Deadpool & Wolverine was to shoot a fake movie called Alpha Cop that was \"intentionally bad.\" It would have been about two cops who share a brain, and a mock poster would have carried the slogan: \"Alpha Cop. Two cops. One brain. All balls.\"\n\nAlpha Cop would then have hit theaters and, five minutes in, switch over to Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\n\"The original idea with this movie was to shoot a fake movie called Alpha Cop that was intentionally bad,\" Reynolds said. \"I even had one of the posters made. It was about two guys who were sharing one brain, and together they make the ultimate cop. And the poster says: 'Alpha Cop. Two cops. One brain. All balls.'\n\n\"It was meant to be kind of like horrible, so 10 people in America would go to see this movie on opening weekend. Five minutes into the movie the Marvel logo would flip up and it would actually be Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nObviously, the Alpha Cop idea didn't end up happening, but it's fun to imagine people sitting down to watch what they thought was going to be a terrible buddy cop movie only to find out they were watching Deadpool & Wolverine instead. Perhaps Alpha Cop will make a cameo appearance should Deadpool 4 eventually see the light of day.\n\nReynolds and co-star Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, have spent the last month or so touring the globe promoting Deadpool & Wolverine, which is the only MCU movie of 2024.

But a crossover episode joking about butt stuff and blow with two of its most beloved characters? Marvel hasn't done that until now. Deadpool & Wolverine arrived for critics' viewing pleasure just ahead of its July 26 release, giving us the opportunity to dive into reviews about the Ryan Reynolds- and Hugh Jackman-led superhero comedy. Critics say the new popcorn movie knows just how to twiddle diehards, what with its fourth-wall-breaking, referential humor that winkingly skewers the MCU, the actors themselves, and, most crucially, the corporate merger between Disney's Marvel and 20th Century Fox, which brought Wolverine into the House of Mouse. Despite its confusing multiverse plotlines and self-aware \"I'm here to make money\" identity, critics can (mostly) agree on one thing: It's funny. More reactions, below.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine isn't a particularly good movie -- I'm not even sure it is a movie -- but it's so determined to beat you down with its incessant irreverence that you might find yourself submitting to it. The picture arrives, of course, at a fallow time for Marvel after a string of duds and an abortive attempt to introduce a new superhero phase following the climactic, stage-clearing (and absurdly lucrative) battles of Avengers: Endgame. It's something of a relief that this new movie isn't trying to reboot or revamp or extend or set the stage for anything. (There is a good joke about how it ties into a specific episode of Loki, and it probably does, but I'm not gonna bother to find out.) Honestly, it appears to exist solely to make money. The film tries to wink its way out of its nonsense plot -- a convoluted setup that involves Deadpool finding a live Wolverine in another universe so that he can save his own universe before it's destroyed by a mysterious organization called the Time Variance Authority (TVA), led by an extremely hammy Matthew Macfadyen. It acknowledges its own cravenness, and that transparency can be preferable to stolid sincerity.\" -- Bilge Ebiri, Vulture\n\n\"The script is upfront about what Disney wouldn't allow Reynolds & Co. to show. Cocaine is prominently mentioned, but nobody does any; butt stuff is described but not depicted; there's homoerotic horseplay and wordplay but no actual sexual person-play. That being said, the writers get more latitude than I assumed they'd get when it comes to criticisms of Disney running the MCU into the ground and off in multiple, incompatible directions post Endgame. 'Welcome to the MCU, by the way,' Wade tells Logan. 'You're joining at a low point.'\" -- Matt Zoller Seitz, Roger Ebert\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine -- which might more accurately have been called Deadpool & His Sidekick Wolverine -- is sometimes very funny, at times a bit flat, and so filled with callbacks to other X-Men and Marvel movies that your head might explode, not in a good way.\" -- Caryn James, BBC\n\n\"The subtle squeamishness over sex and sexuality is one thing. But considered in conjunction with half-assed punchlines about Deadpool fearing being 'canceled by the woke mob' or being over 'Gen Z's trauma-dumping,' it seems Disney is moving the Merc with a Mouth toward conservatism. Perhaps a movie meant to to placate the same audience that gnashed their teeth over the last Star Wars trilogy's -- and The Acolyte's -- focus on marginalized characters over the previously predominantly white, straight, and male heroes. The jokes at the expense of Disney, Marvel, and Kevin Feige play the same way in effect. Sure, they seem initially provocative, with Deadpool calling out Marvel's missteps or Feige's rules for MCU movies. But consider how notoriously controlling these studios are over this IP. Consider Disney and Marvel's history of squelching queer representation on-screen. And you can see how Wade, who is supposed to titillate us with his unapologetic hot takes, feels less like he's breaking fresh ground and more like he's parroting the well-worn gripes of Twitter trolls.\" -- Kristy Puchko, Mashable\n\n\"But in the end, Deadpool & Wolverine is a movie about corporate mergers, about intellectual property, about the ways that the business of Hollywood battles the creative process. It is a film about how anything that was ever successful in Hollywood is made to repeat that same song and dance endlessly, how a bloated and risk-averse industry can't let well enough alone, how nobody is ever really dead anymore, how the world is always ending but the story is never allowed to finish.\" -- Alissa Wilkinson, The New York Times\n\n\"Dwindling grosses, audience ennui, critical maulings -- well, if this is the last hurrah of Marvel it's going down all punchlines blazing. Ebulliently directed by Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum), this is a hyperactive cheese dream that brings together two of Marvel's best characters and a supporting cast who will have nerds frothing at the mouth.\" -- Ed Potton, The Times\n\n\"As bountiful as the action scenes are here, the jokes are the sturdiest part of Deadpool & Wolverine (and if it seems like I'm giving too many of them away, don't worry, there are loads more to go around). That's because the plot is a lumpy stew of familiar elements, given minimal narrative clarity despite the reams of expository technobabble spouted by Matthew Macfadyen's Mr. Paradox.\" -- David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"Hey, you're either the butt of the joke or you're the studio waggling Reynolds's keister at the lens while he pokes fun at your own corporate mergers. Wisecracking about his, and their, mistakes like he's trying to win couples therapy, Deadpool represents what mainstream Marvel flicks couldn't do: make a hard R-rated movie with more curses per minute than a convention of witches. He's what they have to do to win back an audience who's outgrown them.\" -- Amy Nicholson, The Washington Post\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine is as much fun as you can conceivably have at a corporate merger meeting. It's tedious, yet, occasionally, Ryan Reynolds's fourth-wall-allergic \"Merc with a Mouth\" will pass a note around the table with a penis drawn on it, and everyone can have a quiet, little chuckle to themselves.\" -- Clarisse Loughrey, The Independent\n\n\"Audiences (and Disney) may well demand it, though this singular mutant satire works best as an irreverent homage to what's come before, as opposed to the prototype for future superhero movies.\" -- Peter Debruge, Variety\n\n\"It assumes that everyone in the audience is well-versed in the boardroom maneuvers of 20th Century Fox and Disney and will get jokes about what \"Feige said\" (a reference to producer Kevin Feige). When Wilson sees a skull under an Ant-Man helmet, he yuks that Paul Rudd has finally aged. There's also a crack about Jackman's recent divorce. When things get a little too Mad Max-ish, he worries about being in the wrong IP. Who is the audience for this? Entertainment lawyers who watch TMZ?\" -- Jordan Hoffman, Entertainment Weekly", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vulture"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zoe_guy@vulture.com",

It features far more profanity and gory violence than people usually see in MCU movies, which up until now have been relegated to PG-13 territory, with one sexual joke, in particular, creating a problem for Kevin Feige. However, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" does adhere to certain MCU standards in other ways, including offering a couple of treats for fans who stay through the credits.\n\nThe first isn't really a mid-credits scene, instead offering a retrospective on the history of Marvel movies made under 20th Century Fox's banner. As the credits roll, behind-the-scenes footage showcasing actors from the \"X-Men\" and \"Fantastic Four\" movies begins to play, all set to Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\" There's even a quick interview clip of Ryan Reynolds seemingly from the set of \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\" speaking about his enthusiasm for getting to play the Merc with a Mouth. That film may not have been well-received, but it shows just how far Reynolds and superhero movies in general have come in the past decade and a half.\n\nFor a \"Deadpool\" movie, the clip show is surprisingly sentimental, reflecting on actors cast in superhero movies all the way back to the early 2000s.

However, Marvel's president believes sequels are a \"pillar\" of the film industry and necessary for its growth.\n\nSpeaking with Variety, Kevin Feige addressed the concept of sequels and their place in Hollywood. Feige was asked about his movie career and the thinking behind creating universes like the MCU, which has been going strong since 2008. The Marvel boss revealed he's been a fan of sequels since his early days in the movie business, liking the idea of world-building and expanding on character arcs from original films.\n\nRelated\n\nEternals 2 Gets Disappointing Update From Kevin Feige\n\nMarvel Studios president Kevin Feige updates Marvel Cinematic Universe fans on the future of its Eternals franchise.\n\nClose\n\n\"I always liked the world-building and being able to return to characters,\" he said. \"I was always excited for sequels. I was never cynical or rolling my eyes the way people still do today for some reason, even though there've been sequels since the '30s and they're an absolute pillar of the industry. To me, those were always what I enjoyed most, the notion that something I loved was returning and it would expand on what I loved about it.\"\n\n\"To me, those were always what I enjoyed most, the notion that something I loved was returning and it would expand on what I loved about it.\"\n\nFeige has served as a primary producer on MCU projects since the cinematic universe's inception, overseeing several franchises such as Iron Man, Avengers and Captain America. The MCU has come under fire in recent years for lacking originality due to its penchant for sequels, with the high content output triggering superhero fatigue among fans. Recent MCU box office flops such as Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and The Marvels have been partly attributed to said fatigue.\n\nRelated\n\n'Best Characters in Hollywood History': Kevin Feige Hails Deadpool & Wolverine Casting\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Kevin Feige gives high praise to Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.\n\nDisney recently outlined a plan to reduce Marvel's film and TV output in the coming years amid concerns of too many sequels and superhero fatigue. During a Disney earnings call earlier this year, CEO Bob Iger claimed the output reduction was being done to prioritize quality over quantity. \"We're slowly going to decrease volume and go to probably about two TV series a year instead of what had become four, and reduce our film output from maybe four a year to two or at the maximum three. And we're working hard on what that path is, we've got a couple of good films in '25, and then we're heading to more Avengers, which we're extremely excited about,\" he said. His earnings call comments came a few months after expressing his belief Disney makes too many sequels.\n\nOnly One MCU Movie Will Be Released in 2024\n\nThe content reduction plan is already being executed, with the Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman-led Deadpool & Wolverine being the lone MCU movie release this year. Meanwhile, Echo and Agatha All Along are the only TV series debuting in 2024.\n\nEarly indications point to Deadpool & Wolverine generating a big bounceback for the MCU at the box office, while the team-up blockbuster has generated encouraging reviews. Though Deadpool & Wolverine is the third Deadpool film, it isn't a threequel, considering it's the first to take place in the MCU, with the previous entries happening in the 20th Century Fox

Deadpool & Wolverine is watchable. In fact, it feels more like a warm hug to the X-Men series. But the movie becomes a bit overbearing and loses its momentum halfway through. As a whole, the underwhelming aspects do not matter. Especially when you are treated to some ROFL jokes by Deadpool. Flaunting himself as 'Marvel Jesus,' the superhero in a TVA-sponsored brand-new suit is a delight until you get tired of it.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine story\n\nWade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) isn't exactly discontent with his post-Deadpool 2 life as a car salesman with Peter (Rob Delaney) with Blind Al (Leslie Uggams) as his roomie. He's fine with occasionally spending time with the X-Men's Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand) and Colossus (Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107) and maintaining a friendship with his ex-fianc\u00e9e Vanessa (Morena Baccarin). Now that Wade knows he's part of the action, he feels he could do more if Kevin Feige let him join the Avengers like Captain America or Thor.\n\nThe movie's rushed introduction of TVA agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) in the first act to explain the significance of one universe's Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) may confuse rather than clarify how Deadpool & Wolverine fits into the broader MCU narrative.\n\nFreeing themselves from the clutches of the supervillain Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrines)- the self-acclaimed queen of the void, uniting for the ultimate showdown, saving Deadpool's universe and the heroic duo's constant banter makes the whole plot seem more like a fan service. It's neither bad nor iconic.\n\nLet's skip to the good part...\n\nLogan always keeps you wanting for more with his serious demeanour and mean remarks. Hugh's return is heartfelt with his sharp dialogue delivery hitting the mark. Also, prepare yourself for some ultime Wolverine thirst traps. Deadpool & Wolverine's gripping climax is appreciable too.\n\nRyan Reynolds is Ryan Reynolds and that is -being a Marvel fan-girl. Undoubtedly, Logan's reclamation is the backbone of an indestructible heroic team. Despite the messy action, the choreography in the initial hour is mind-blowing. With an immensely enjoyable relay of cameos, the fan service doesn't fall on the bad side of the review spectrum.\n\nEmma Corrins is absolutely great as Cassandra, especially when she is fingering the brains out of everyone. Her frigid look is no less than her twin brother Professor X.\n\nFor pro-Disney peeps, there's a gazillion of humour waiting for you. And giving zero spoilers, the Deadpool jokes are exceptional. His fetish for the enemies-to-friends trope with Logan is cartoonish. But it is the silly things that will make you chuckle in this multiverse of madness.\n\nWhere's the flaw?\n\nThe film felt pretty fair to watch but despite Hugh's marvellous acting skills, Wolverine's role feels 'meh'. At least until he puts on his suit. The lazy writing couldn't do justice to his redemption arc. Of course, his presence feels overshadowed. In a personal rant, Marvel needs to invest their brains in directing their action sequences. The fight scenes do not seem smooth and one might feel the urge to just skip it instead. The transitions don't meet the benchmark, with multiple cuts in between them, putting a huge question mark on their million-dollar VFX. What's equally surprising is that in many instances the satire isn't as sharp or well-timed as in the other parts of the Deadpool series.\n\nWatch Deadpool & Wolverine if you are up for a cameo fest and some cool and politically-incorrect Deadpool jokes.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vanshika_singh@news9live.com", "name": "Vanshika Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fan service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Kapi\u010di\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianna_Hildebrand", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brianna Hildebrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Delaney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Delaney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Uggams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leslie Uggams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Macfadyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Macfadyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morena_Baccarin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morena Baccarin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervillain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supervillain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Xavier_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charles Xavier (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satire"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Science", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Deadpool-and-Wolverine-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

The Marvel Cinematic Universe is dire need of saving, the Avengers are nowhere to be found and the biggest name in entertainment is once again relying on an unlikely hero.\n\nYes, it is happening again. Marvel Studios, the theatrical juggernaut that once churned out billion-dollar hits as easily as Wade Wilson spits out f-bombs, is in its forth year of chasing the cultural and critical highs reached by 2019's \"Avengers: Endgame.\" The last 11 films haven't quite done it, the 10 Disney Plus shows definitely haven't done it and superhero fatigue is at an all-time high. It's no longer a question of if these movies will make a billion dollars. It's a question of if these movies will actually be made.\n\nNow Marvel is turning to a beloved character that once seemed like he'd never fit in the sanitized, family-friendly Disney confines of the MCU. The gulliest, goriest anti-hero of them all. The Merc with a Mouth. Deadpool.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" comes to theaters on Friday, the first and only MCU film of 2024 -- a major departure for a studio that used to regularly release three movies every year. It brings with it not only the studio's first R-rating, but two absolutely beloved characters who enter the MCU thanks to Disney's purchase of 21st Century Fox.\n\nREAD MORE: All 34 Marvel movies, including 'Deadpool and Wolverine,' ranked\n\nAs a self-admitted comic book nerd who anticipates these movies with nearly religious fervor and obsesses over every detail, I spend much of my time watching these movies and discussing them focusing on what they are leading to. How does this connect to the next movie? Which characters are they teasing? Are the Avengers coming back? But with the franchise in unprecidentedly rough shape, I shifted my mentality as I sat down for \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\" I stopped thinking about what this movie meant for the future of the MCU and just tried to enjoy it.\n\nAnd holy crap. Did I enjoy it.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is one of the funniest, bloodiest, most meta and self-referential movies I have ever seen. It's irreverent, yet heartfelt at times even moving. It spends more time making fun of the Marvel Cinematic Universe than it does trying to join it, and writes a love letter to Fox Studios comic book movies I didn't know we needed. Yes, there are cameos that even I didn't know were coming. Yes, I screamed in the theater when ***** came on screen.\n\nBut the core of this movie is its titular characters, and the actors that were born to play them. There would be no Deadpool movies without Ryan Reynolds, who somehow makes this sadistic psychopath charming, and seeing him play in the expanded Marvel sandbox is exhillerating. Bringing Hugh Jackman out of retirement to reprise the role of Wolverine could have been an absolute disaster that ruined his beautiful final act in 2017's \"Logan.\" But it's a complete joy to see everyone's favorite X-Men member in his comic-accurate blue and yellow suit and somehow earn even more pathos as a character.\n\nThe chemistry between these two characters is absolutely electric, and the buddy cop/road trip comedy vibes truly make this feel like \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" with superheroes. And the fight scenes, which relied less blatently on CGI than previous films from this studio, were plainly fun as hell. I could see Deadpool's katanas clash with Wolverine's adamantium claws all day long.\n\nIs the plot convoluted? Yes! It's a comic book movie. Even the absolute best movies in this genre aren't revered for their plots. The first two Deadpool movies weren't winning any best screenplay Oscars and they were still beloved. Hell, spend enough time thinking about the plot of \"The Dark Knight,\" widely considered the best comic book movie ever, and you'll find yourself scratching your head.\n\nHere's what no one seems to understand about \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" and the genre writ large. We come to this place for superhero magic. Ridiculous action scenes that look like they're pulled right from the pages of a comic book. References to comic book lore that make us feel like we're kids again, even if some us weren't even kids when the Marvel Cinematic Universe launched in 2008. Cameos. Yes. We love cameos! Humor that points out how ridiculous this genre is -- and yes, how corporate and confusingly intertwined this has all gotten. Deadpool repeatedly joking about post-endgame Marvel's struggles (even specifically trashing the multiverse storyline) is exactly what I want from a Deadpool movie. I laughed so much my face hurt by the end.\n\nI'm not saying we shouldn't be criticial of superhero movies, I've ripped Marvel plenty in recent years. But this movie isn't for you, maybe you just don't like comic book movies anymore! And that's okay.\n\nDid \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" blaze the trail forward for the MCU as much as I would have liked? Probably not. But after years of people complaining about how overly interconnected all these movies are, it was actually refreshing to watch a movie that was surprisingly self-contained.\n\nIt's not 100% clear where the MCU is going from here. And for once, I don't care. I loved the hell out of this movie, enough that I already have a ticket to see it again. I wasn't worrying about the franchise's path during the MCU's rise in the 2010s, I was just along for the ride. There wasn't a clear-cut direction until things really coalessed following \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" in 2015 -- things just got retconned and rexplained to fit all together in the run-up to \"Infinity War\" and \"Endgame.\"\n\nMaybe Marvel will never reach those heights again. Most of the stars that got them there have left the franchise, and working in this system is clearly taxing. Maybe the Russo Bros. will return and save the day for the next two Avengers movies as is being reported. Whatever the case, I just got to see two characters I never expected in the MCU.\n\nTo pharaphrase Wade Wilson, I've been waiting a long time for this team-up. And it was worth the wait.\n\n* 'Quantumania' is proof. We can officially panic about Marvel. | Review\n\n* 'Wakanda Forever' doesn't touch 'Black Panther.'

Those marks include the highest domestic opening of 2024 and the biggest debut ever for an R-rated film.\n\nDisney and Pixar's \"Inside Out 2\" is currently the highest opener of the year at $154.2 million and the first \"Deadpool\" film's $132.4 million debut is the highest for any R-rated feature, according to data from Comscore.\n\n\"I think no question this is going to open as the largest R-rated movie of all time,\" said Mike Bowers, president and CEO of Harkins Theatres, a theater chain based in Arizona. \"And it's already one of the top presale movies historically for us.\"\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is the 34th film to be released under the MCU banner and the first to garner an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association. The previous two Deadpool films, both rated R, were produced and released through 20th Century Fox. Disney acquired the company in 2019, bringing the X-Men and Fantastic Four back into the larger Marvel portfolio.\n\nSimilar to previous entries in the MCU, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is benefiting from fan fervor. Audiences are eager to see the flick in its opening weekend in order to avoid spoilers. Disney has kept much of the film's content secret and provided limited press screenings prior to its debut.\n\nBowers expects audiences will keep coming back for more in the weeks after the film's opening.\n\n\"This is a film that there's so much happening, so many jokes and funny sequences that no one's gonna be able to eat just one, you know, they're gonna be back,\" he said.\n\nEllis Jacob, president and CEO of Cineplex, the largest movie theater chain in Canada, echoed Bower's thoughts. Jacob said \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is filled with Easter eggs and audiences will return to try and see them all.\n\nHe also noted that many of those moviegoers are buying tickets for premium screenings, such as IMAX, Dolby and ScreenX, which come at higher prices.\n\nMarvel has also collaborated with movie theaters to license merchandise such as collectible popcorn buckets and drink containers that cinema operators expect will sell quickly. Concessions have always been the biggest money maker for theaters, and having limited-edition items can drive even higher food and beverage sales.\n\nOf course, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is also an important release for the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has \"eased off the gas pedal\" and planned fewer releases in the series that drove the global box office for more than a decade, said Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. He said Disney is trying to right the ship after a series of theatrical missteps and poor box office hauls, as well as a deluge of streaming content that overcrowded the market and overwhelmed even the MCU's biggest fans.\n\n\"Ultimately, as much as this is a Marvel movie, it may be viewed equally as a midsummer action comedy that stars personalities and brands that die-hard fans and casual viewers love,\" said Robbins. \"Reynolds and Jackman are a grand slam duo given their respective pop culture presences and friendly back-and-forth across social media and interviews. There's also a genuine curiosity about how the MCU's first R-rated film will play out and hold to the qualities which made the first two Deadpool films and [Jackman's 2017 Wolverine film] 'Logan' so popular.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcbayarea.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Bay Area"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_whitten@nbcbayarea.com", "name": "Sarah Whitten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandango_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandango Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comscore", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comscore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixar", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harkins_Theatres", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harkins Theatres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineplex_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cineplex Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScreenX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ScreenX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IMAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures_and_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Cultures and Groups", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2024/07/108011558-1721882353958-deadpool_wolverine_Cropped_0d4aa9.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Instead, it's a phenomenal standalone adventure which, despite some exciting nods to the wider MCU, keeps the focus on its leads.\n\nStill, there are some intriguing hints about what the future holds in store for Wade Wilson and Logan in the MCU.\n\nWhen Mr. Paradox first brings the Merc with the Mouth to the TVA, he offers him a place on the Sacred Timeline (Earth-616) before Earth-100005's destruction. However, he only does so because his bosses believe the anti-hero has an important role to play in the future.\n\nDeadpool even gets a glimpse of that when we see a screen with Chris Hemsworth's Thor cradling a dying Wade (half his mask has been destroyed) as he sobs over his fallen comrade. It might be a gag, but Paradox really doesn't want the Merc to see his future so this scene may well be revisited.\n\nAs we explained earlier today, Deadpool & Wolverine concludes with the title duo back on Earth-100005 as the timeline thrives. Loki's Hunter B-15 arrests Paradox for his creation of the Time Ripper and says to Wade and Logan that their role in the Multiverse is just beginning. Once again, the insinuation is that these two are crucial to what's happening on the Sacred Timeline.\n\nHowever, if Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman decline to return, this movie still serves as a fitting and emotional send-off.\n\nDeadpool can work in a PG-13 setting (albeit sparingly) and it's established earlier in the movie that Wolverine is no fan of Earth's Mightiest Heroes when he says, \"F*** The Avengers.\" With that in mind, Avengers 5 and Avengers: Secret Wars must be something the actors have discussed with Kevin Feige.\n\nWill these two find themselves on opposite sides of a conflict between the Avengers and X-Men? That would be a fun way to give us a rematch...\n\nYou can read our full review of Deadpool & Wolverine here, but we concluded by saying, \"A contender for the best superhero movie ever, Deadpool & Wolverine is two hours of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman proving they were born to play these roles and, crucially, be part of the MCU.

Well, it depends on which Wade & Logan we're talking about.\n\nThe issue with that question, and one of the major issues with \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" (if not the entire Multiverse Saga) is one of variants. When the Marvel Cinematic Universe began back in the merry days of 2008, a post-credits tease at the end of Jon Favreau's \"Iron Man\" promised more Marvel characters would make it to the big screen and share space. As this shot-calling prophecy came to pass, it wasn't just a fulfillment of the pipe dreams of so many comic book lovers; it was also a promise that these characters would be done the \"right\" way.\n\nThat's because, until the MCU began, Marvel characters on screen had been handled by other studios -- namely Sony and 20th Century Fox -- who dared to reconceptualize certain canonic aspects of these heroes. As the more \"accurate\" MCU grew to heights of rabid popularity, the Sony and Fox-produced Marvel films (which were once the only game in town) now seemed odd and almost quaint. They were the kooky underdogs, after a fashion, and it's in that spirit that 2016's \"Deadpool\" and its sequel, 2018's \"Deadpool 2,\" felt genuinely subversive. Those films had no need to assuage MCU management; they could throw up a middle finger at themselves, other comic book films, and geek culture with abandon.\n\nNow, with \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" we have a movie that's ostensibly a swan song for the Fox-verse which also welcomes the two titular un-killable mutants to the MCU. Yet this film canonically does not feature the same old Wolverine, and, in essence, the old Deadpool is gone, too.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Favreau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Super_Hero_Squad:_The_Infinity_Gauntlet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Super Hero Squad: The Infinity Gauntlet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geek"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/deadpool-wolverine-ending-explained-whats-next-for-wade-logan/l-intro-1721944521.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

After making his debut as The Merc with a Mouth in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009, Reynolds knew that one day he wanted to make his Deadpool-Wolverine team-up official once more on the big screen. He even asked Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige about it when Disney acquired Fox - the then-studio behind both characters - in 2019.\n\n\"I've waited my whole life to work with him in this way,\" he tells Complex. \"The opportunity to do something just slightly new with [Wolverine] in this movie was really special,\" Reynolds adds.\n\nJackman, synonymous with Wolverine for over two decades and who fans thought they had seen the last of after his death in Logan (2017), brings a new level of enthusiasm to this project, largely fueled by a long-overdue costume change with his debut in the comic-accurate yellow suit. \"I looked in the mirror and was like, 'Damn, how the hell did I not do this for the last 24 years?\" Jackman comments with a chuckle.\n\nThis film not only brings these two powerhouse actors together, but also marks a new chapter for the duo as they transition from the Fox era to Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe, an exciting new playground with endless possibilities. The merger has opened up a treasure trove of possibilities, and Reynolds and Jackman hold no stops exploring this new playground in their upcoming movie.\n\nAs Deadpool & Wolverine prepares to hit theaters, the excitement surrounding this Marvel debut is palpable.

We know as gamers ourselves, this is an exciting way to engage through play with the GamesBeat content you have already come to love. Start playing games here.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is one of the most anticipated movies of the year, thanks in part to its clever (and widespread) marketing blitz. In addition to a wide variety of brands, the third Deadpool outing (and his first in the Marvel Cinematic Universe) is leveraging video game partnerships to promote the film to players.\n\nFrom its viral cheeky controllers to in-game takeovers, the gaming activations promoting Deadpool and Wolverine broadly fall into two categories: crossovers with other gaming properties and games based on Marvel IP.\n\nNotably, two major titles are missing on this list -- Marvel Rivals and Call of Duty. NetEase is currently running its closed beta test for its team-based hero shooter Marvel Rivals. While the company is attending San Diego Comic Con, the team hasn't cross-promoted Deadpool and Wolverine yet.\n\nMeanwhile, fans theorized that Call of Duty would also run a promotional event for the film. However, the data mined animations fans used as evidence turned out to be for its current WWE crossover.\n\nMarvel Snap, the mobile collectible card game from Second Dinner and Nuverse, has themed its current competitive season around Deadpool. Dubbed Maximum Effort, the season pass features themed cosmetics and the introduction of Gwenpool as a card. Additionally, the season added two new themed locations -- Weapon X Facility and Taco Truck -- to its rotation.\n\nThe game also rolled out a new time-limited mode called Deadpool's Diner. Players can climb the ranks and earn up to 32 different rewards in the high-risk, high-reward mode. These include themed cosmetics and the new Cassandra Nova card -- the villain of the Deadpool and Wolverine movie.\n\nTo fully promote this limited time mode, Marvel Snap has organized a creator tournament on July 26. In the Conquerors Deadpool Domination tournament, 14 creators will play Deadpool's Diner starting at 12 p.m. PT to collect as many 'bubs' as they can. The creator with the most after two hours will take home the crown. Players can vote for who they think will win for additional in-game currency and the chance at an exclusive Elektra card variant.\n\nMarvel Snap also ran a Twitch Drops campaign themed around the upcoming movie. Players that linked their in-game and Twitch accounts and watched for six hours could earn a new Wolverine card variant.\n\nMarvel Strike Force\n\nBeat the heat in Marvel Strike Force's Deadpool and Wolverine-themed pool party event. In this four-week long adventure, players will follow Deadpool as he turns S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Hellicarrier into a summer pool party. Each week, gamers can play four new missions for Scopely's turn-based mobile RPG.\n\nOf course, this event comes with plenty of cosmetics for players to earn.

Don't @ me.\n\nIf there's one thing you can be sure of when you go to see a Marvel movie -- really any action movie these days -- it's the presence of a post-credits scene and Deadpool & Wolverine is no exception. The third film in the Deadpool franchise hit cinemas on July 26, 2024, but the hype began well and truly before then.\n\nRelated: Here are all the biggest Deadpool & Wolverine spoilers to read at your own peril\n\nThe MCU has a rich history of post-credits scenes, ranging from teasers for future films to entertaining silliness. As of Echo (2024), there have been more than 81 post-credits scenes across 45 properties, including films, short films, television series, animated shorts, and television specials.\n\nIf you're seeing a Marvel film in the theater, there's no question you're hanging around until the end when the lights come on. Post-credits scenes are perhaps the most anticipated part of any Marvel movie -- in fact, in 2021's Eternals, one journalist spoiled the fact that Harry Styles makes a cameo appearance and faced the wrath of fans online for ruining the moment. With its latest installment, here's everything you need to know about the Deadpool & Wolverine post-credits scene. Spoilers ahead!\n\nHow many post-credit scenes are there?\n\nThere's one post-credits scene in Deadpool & Wolverine and it happens right at the end. However, there are other tributes to 20th Century Fox (Marvel's former owner) throughout the mid-credits set to Green Day's classic song Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\n\nTo explain the context of the post-credits scene: earlier in the film, Deadpool tells villain Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin) that Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) has been talking shit about her, including how he'd rather die by her hands than work for her.\n\nWe're led to believe Deadpool made it all up, that Johnny didn't say all of those things, so when Nova kills Johnny, the audience is supposed to be shocked because we think he died in vain. Come to the post-credits, Deadpool addresses the audience, explaining that he didn't want us to think he was responsible for Johnny's death.\n\nWe're shown footage wherein Johnny says, verbatim, what Deadpool said he did, including that Cassandra can \"lick my god damn cinnamon ring clean,\" says Evans. \"I won't be happy until I've urinated on her freshly-barbecued corpse.\" LOL", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_hanson@stylecaster.com", "name": "Sophie Hanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternals_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eternals (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Styles", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Styles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_special", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television special"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Riddance_(Time_of_Your_Life)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/deadpool-and-wolverine-.png?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

The original film belonged to the Fox century universe and Deadpool 3 is set to mark its official entry into the MCU. Apart from the X-men, the film is also expected to recall moments from other movies like X-men Days of Future Past, OG Deadpool movies, Tv series like Loki and many more. Before the film's release here is a recap of what you need to remember.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by @deadpoolmovie\n\nAfter being diagnosed with terminal cancer, Wade is approached by a secret program that promises to cure his cancer and grant him superhuman abilities. However, the experimentation includes injecting him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. But the only way to awaken it is by extreme stress and near-death experiences. After being burned to death in an explosion, Wade attains regenerative healing power that cures his cancer and gives him the ability to heal from any injury rapidly.\n\nDeadpool 2 ending changed the timeline. Cable gifted his time travel device as a token of appreciation for helping him save his family. It has led to him travelling through time over and over again to save Vanessa from being killed by a hitman. Deadpool 3 teaser also confirmed that Wade went back to save various members of X-Force who had met untimely deaths. Deadpool can be seen calling them his family that he needs to protect and save once again.\n\nSEE ALSO: Deadpool & Wolverine: From Vanessa, Sabertooth To Possible Ladypool, Every Cameo Explained\n\nWade's constant trips through time and messing with timelines has seems to be what led the TVA to him, which will eventually land him in the void. The void is also the same place where pruned variants end up. Loki shows different variants of Loki stuck there, as we might also see different versions of X-men and Deadpool, which were caught and pruned by the TVA.\n\nMeanwhile, TVA has gone through a major change in recent releases. Loki has not only saved the multiverse, but TVA is now working to protect the timeline. Loki saving the multiverse could mean that Fox century's X-Men universe could have been one of the many branching timelines which has now been preserved. And with Loki changing the objective of the TVA (which is now to save all the branched timeline) we could see how they aim to help Wolverine save his timeline as well.\n\nAmid all the different branches of the timeline, one still exists when Deadpool and Wolverine originally met in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Wade Wilson has previously mentioned the same in Deadpool 2, however, it is likely that the same will come up again. Deadpool in the original film though played by Ryan Reynolds looked very different. Instead of knives, he was given a singular sword length claw on each hand to fight. Other controversial changes to his character include laser eyes and sewing his mouth shut.\n\nSEE ALSO: Agatha All Along Trailer Breakdown: New Characters, Easter Eggs And Secrets You Missed\n\nWolverine once again met Deadpool from the current MCU universe when he travelled between the worlds to kill that version of himself. However, it is unclear if the Logan we meet in Deadpool & Wolverine will be the same one from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. For the unversed, Hugh Jackman's character has seen and changed several timelines himself. While he died in the 2017 film Logan, there is another timeline which was saved at the end of Days of Future Past. Meanwhile, the timelines in Deadpool & Wolverine shows a world were all the other X-men have died. Some of these timelines maybe connected but can be confirmed only after the film releases.\n\nThe biggest concern for TVA and in turn Logan and Wade Wilson will be MCU grappling with \"Incursion\" events as shown in Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness. Loki's work may have slowed down the process but it hasn't stopped from universes collide and spill into one another. The same was also seen in the recent theatrical release Captain Marvel 2 aka The Marvels.\n\nCover Image: Instagram", "source": {"uri": "in.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sanyukta_thakare@in.mashable.com", "name": "Sanyukta Thakare", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboCop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RoboCop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Days_of_Future_Past", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Days of Future Past"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_All_Along", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agatha All Along"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Strange_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Strange (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvels", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Marvels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_in/seo/7/76575/76575_3fen.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Turn back now if you haven't seen the Marvel Phase 5 movie yet!\n\nNow, if you're still reading, then you'll know that one of the Deadpool and Wolverine cameos is Wesley Snipes as Blade. He helps Wade and Logan make it back to Cassandra Nova's lair, in the hopes that they can break free and get home to Earth-616.\n\nAs the group, which also includes Jennifer Garner as Elektra, Channing Tatum as Gambit, and Dafne Keen as X-23, races towards Cassandra, a reference is made to Punisher. Deadpool asks which Punisher they're talking about, as there have been more than one. Snipes then says there is only one Blade - and there's only going to be one Blade. Cue Deadpool looking straight down the camera.\n\nOf course, the MCU is attempting to reboot Blade with a new movie starring Mahershala Ali. The key word there, though, is attempting. The new film has been plagued by production setbacks, meaning that, five years after it was announced, we're still no closer to the film hitting the big screen. Snipes himself even poked fun at the most recent behind the scenes upheaval.\n\n\"Best line of the movie good god,\" says one fan, while another says: \"When Snipes says there's only one Blade, and Deadpool looks at the camera all smug, I cried out in laughter. What a perfect movie to say goodbye to Fox, they got away with so many jokes because they could outright say it.\"\n\n\"What's great about Snipes' Blade quote is that Deadpool's stare at the camera can be interpreted in many ways. It's either: 'This dude doesn't know Marvel Studios is recasting the character for a solo film,' 'This dude is right. That Blade Marvel Studios film is never happening LMAO' And an extra: 'This dude doesn't know about the super obscure Blade TV Show,'\" says someone else. In Blade: The Series, Kirk Jones played the character.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is in UK cinemas now and hits US theaters on July 26.

Between a story that involves Marvel's \"multiverse\" and the merc-with-the-mouth's proclivity for fourth-wall breaking, the Deadpool threequel is practically tailor-made for special appearances.\n\nThese cameos include existing Marvel characters, several who starred in pre-MCU movies from other studios, and even casting rumors that will only make sense if you're attuned to comic-book movie production news (\u00e0 la Nicolas Cage's Superman in The Flash). While their sheer variety borders on gratuitous, they also happen to lead several genuinely hilarious and meaningful moments. And since the movie is scant on coherent drama for its leads (and cuts away quickly the moment its action threatens to become cool), these surprise appearances may just be the best part of Deadpool & Wolverine, whether they're in-jokes for the fans, or serve an actual purpose in the plot -- or in some cases, both.\n\nJon Favreau as Happy Hogan\n\nThe first cameo is a low-key one: Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan, friend and security chief to the unseen Tony Stark. This scene, set in the main Marvel universe six years in the past (while Stark was still alive), sees Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) sitting down for a job interview to become an Avenger. He gets rejected, a blow to his self-worth that ripples throughout the movie. As an everyday human with no superpowers, Happy may not be the MCU's most glamorous character, but he's been part of the franchise since the beginning (Favreau both appeared in and directed the original Iron Man), and his presence is a fitting way to welcome Deadpool into the Marvel fold.\n\nChris Hemsworth as Thor\n\nYears later, once Deadpool ends up in trouble with the Time Variance Authority (the time-keeping organization from Loki), hints that we're now in the MCU start popping up onscreen. We see scenes from The Avengers, and one in which Thor (Chris Hemsworth) weeps over Deadpool's dying body. That may not technically count as a new appearance, since the image recycles and manipulates existing footage (Hemsworth wasn't even aware he was in Deadpool & Wolverine), but there's no dearth of traditional cameos in the rest of the film.\n\nThe (back of) Hulk('s head)\n\nAs Deadpool travels across the multiverse in search of different versions of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), he comes across one who happens to be fighting the Hulk, whom we see from behind. It's a nice reference to Wolverine's first-ever comic appearance, in which he battles the big green Avenger.\n\nHenry Cavill as Wolverine\n\nHere's where things start to get weird. Deadpool finds a version of Wolverine played by none other than former Superman actor Henry Cavill. Like John Krasinski's Reed Richards in the Doctor Strange sequel, Cavill's appearance pays off years of fan art and online chatter about who should take over from Jackman when he eventually passes the torch, though given how much money Deadpool & Wolverine is about to make, that might not happen anytime soon.\n\nTyler Mane as Sabretooth and more X-Men baddies\n\nOnce Deadpool begins multiverse-hopping -- and especially once he and Wolverine get stuck in \"the void,\" where characters and elements from alternate realities are sent to die -- all bets are off. Nobody really needs a concrete reason to show up beyond the filmmakers deciding they should, so we get a few appearances from X-Men actors and characters of old. Tyler Mane reprises his role as the feral Sabretooth from X-Men (2000), and he's joined by the fire-wielding Pyro (Aaron Stanford) from X2: X-Men United (2003) and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). They belong to a band of wasteland outlaws populated by other Marvel villains from 20th Century Fox films, albeit played by new actors since they happen to be \"variants.\" These include Toad from X-Men, Lady Deathstrike from X2, Juggernaut, Callisto, and Arclight from The Last Stand, Azazel from X-Men First Class, Psylocke from X-Men: Apocalypse, Bullseye from Daredevil, and even \"The Russian\" from Lionsgate's 2004 version of The Punisher.\n\nChris Evans as Johnny Storm\n\nBut the first hero from a pre-MCU Marvel movie arrives in the form of a major bait and switch. A hooded figure in blue speaks in a familiar voice and reveals himself to be played by Marvel mainstay Chris Evans. As Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme fades in on the soundtrack, Deadpool excitedly prepares for Captain America to utter his iconic rallying call: \"Avengers assemble!\" Except, at the last second, Evans instead yells, \"Flame on!\" Turns out Evans is reprising his second-most-famous comic-book role, the Human Torch, a.k.a. Johnny Storm from Fox's Fantastic Four (2005), who takes to the sky in a literal blaze of glory.\n\nDafne Keen as X-23\n\nThis sets the stage for several other Marvel characters from Fox movies to appear. As teased in a recent trailer, a now adult Dafne Keen reprises her role as Laura/X-23 from Logan (2017) to give Wolverine a pep talk, which is sweet, even though this version of Wolverine has never met her before. She's part of a group whose worlds have all been destroyed and who are now looking for ways to finish their stories -- a nice meta-reference to some of their franchises being cut short or never getting off the ground to begin with.\n\nJennifer Garner as Elektra\n\nThe first of these characters to appear is Jennifer Garner's sai-wielding anti-hero Elektra Natchios, from Fox's much-maligned Daredevil (2003) and Elektra (2005). Garner's version of the character (who has since been played by Elodie Yung on Netflix) isn't particularly well regarded by fans, but the character's poor reception plays into her story here as someone searching for absolution and a way to bring her story to fruition. Plus, Garner's specific presence also yields a fun jab at ex-husband Ben Affleck, whose Daredevil is said to have died off-screen. When Deadpool offers his condolences, she quickly brushes it off with a snappy, \"It's fine.\"\n\nWesley Snipes as Blade\n\nGarner's older, wiser Elektra is followed by a similarly aged-up Blade, the day-walking vampire (and vampire hunter) played by Wesley Snipes in New Line's Blade trilogy. The actor's graying beard adds to his panache -- few superheroes have ever looked as cool in the genre's history -- but his appearance is especially surprising. Snipes famously hated working with Reynolds on Blade: Trinity, behind-the-scenes lore this film makes sure to reference. Before he heads off to battle, Snipes quips that there's only one Blade, and there's only going to be one Blade, a clear jab at Marvel's reboot of the character starring Mahershala Ali, which was first announced in 2019 but has since languished in production limbo.\n\nChanning Tatum as Gambit\n\nAnd finally, Channing Tatum shows up as a surprisingly comics-accurate version of Remy LeBeau/Gambit, the character he signed on to play in an X-Men spinoff back in 2014, which was eventually shelved amid the Fox-Disney merger five years later. Tatum is perhaps the funniest part of the entire film and actually makes the case for why his solo project being canceled may have been a good thing: His attempt at the character's Cajun accent is completely (and intentionally) incomprehensible.\n\nWunmi Mosaku as Hunter B-15, Blake Lively as Lady Deadpool, and more cameos\n\nThe above are all the movie's biggest cameos, but there are more familiar faces almost everywhere you look. Wunmi Mosaku briefly reprises her role as TVA agent Hunter B-15 from Loki, while a female version of Deadpool, long rumored to be played by Taylor Swift, is played by Reynolds's wife, Blake Lively -- or at least voiced by her (we never see her face). And, of course, it wouldn't be a Marvel movie without the late Stan Lee, whose face can be seen in an advertisement on the side of a bus.", "source": {"uri": "vulture.com", "dataType": "news",

Chris Evans, the beloved Captain America, who retired from his post after the events of 'Avengers: Endgame', makes a comeback in this Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman-led film in an unexpected special appearance that fans could never guess.\n\nTo understand his comeback, we must turn back the time to 2005, when Evans first played Johnny Storm in 20th Century Fox's original production Fantastic Four, later acquired by Disney. Almost five years before he appeared as Steve Rogers in the MCU, Evans played The Human Torch, who was revived in the latest entry of Deadpool.\n\nJohnny Storm meets Reynolds' The Merc With The Mouth and Jackman's clawed mutant in the Void dimension, a purgatory reality of sorts, where the TVA (Time Variance Authority) punishes revolting superheroes. This Johnny is all talks and no flames, consistent with the humorous plot of the film. He serves as the bridge to Deadpool and Wolverine meeting the main villain Cassandra Nova and a funny one at that.\n\nEvans' cameo culminates amusingly with Deadpool quipping a Disney-can't-afford-him joke, evoking laughter. Notably, his appearance is another theatrical gimmick of Marvel with potentially no future as we all know it is Stranger Things fame Joseph Quinn who takes on the role of Johnny Storm in MCU's revival of Fantastic Four, scheduled to release in 2025.\n\nBesides Chris Evans, Henry Cavill as Wolverine is another unexpected cameo in 'Deadpool & Wolverine' along with many X-Men Mutants Elektra, Gambit, and more.

The previous two Deadpool films, both rated R, were produced and released through 20th Century Fox. Disney acquired the company in 2019, bringing the X-Men and Fantastic Four back into the larger Marvel portfolio.\n\nLike previous entries in the MCU, \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is benefitting from fan fervor. Audiences are eager to see the flick in its opening weekend in order to avoid spoilers. Disney has kept much of the film's content secret and provided limited press screenings prior to its debut.\n\nAnd Bowers expects audiences will keep coming back for more in the weeks after the film's opening.\n\n\"This is a film that there's so much happening, so many jokes and funny sequences that no one's gonna be able to eat just one, you know, they're gonna be back,\" he said.\n\nEllis Jacob, president and CEO of Cineplex, the largest movie theater chain in Canada, echoed Bower's thoughts. Jacob said \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is filled with Easter eggs and audiences will return to try and see them all.\n\nHe also noted that many of those moviegoers are buying tickets for premium screenings, like IMAX, Dolby and ScreenX, which come at higher prices.\n\nMarvel has also collaborated with movie theaters to license merchandise like collectible popcorn buckets and drink containers that cinema operators expect will sell quickly. Concessions have always been the biggest money maker for theaters, and having limited edition items can drive even higher food and beverage sales.\n\nOf course, \"Deadpool and Wolverine\" is also an important release for the overall Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney has \"eased off the gas pedal\" and planned fewer releases in the series that drove the global box office for more than a decade, said Shawn Robbins, founder and owner of Box Office Theory. He said Disney is trying to right the ship after a series of theatrical missteps and poor box office hauls, as well as an deluge of streaming content that overcrowded the market and overwhelmed even the MCU's biggest fans.\n\n\"Ultimately, as much as this is a Marvel movie, it may be viewed equally as a midsummer action comedy that stars personalities and brands that die-hard fans and casual viewers love,\" said Robbins. \"Reynolds and Jackman are a grand slam duo given their respective pop culture presences and friendly back-and-forth across social media and interviews. There's also a genuine curiosity about how the MCU's first R-rated film will play out and hold to the qualities which made the first two Deadpool films and [Jackman's 2017 Wolverine film] 'Logan' so popular.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNBC"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_whitten@cnbc.com", "name": "Sarah Whitten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ScreenX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ScreenX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cineplex_Entertainment", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cineplex Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IMAX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108011558-1721882353958-deadpool_wolverine_Cropped.jpg?v=1721882403&w=1920&h=1080", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

What Parents Should Know About the R-Rated Marvel Sequel", "body": "Benjamin VanHoose is an Associate Editor on the Movies team at PEOPLE. He has written about entertainment and breaking news for over five years.\n\nDeadpool's raunchy humor is now officially part of Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nRyan Reynolds brings the comic book character's vulgar sensibilities to the world of the Avengers in Deadpool & Wolverine, which comes after Disney purchased Fox, which oversaw the previous Deadpool and X-Men films.\n\nThe film, which also stars Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, is rated R for \"strong bloody violence and language throughout, gore and sexual references.\" Before it, the last two Deadpool films, which hit theaters in 2016 and 2018, were also rated R.\n\nVariety asked director Shawn Levy as well as Reynolds and Jackman if they thought the film is suitable for kids.\n\n\"It's obviously R-rated, and I don't want to get in trouble by encouraging -- ,\" began Levy, as Reynolds said, \"I do. So many kids have seen Deadpool and Deadpool 2. My own kids have seen it. ... It's never rated R just to be rated R. A lot of it is just the character. The character is very crass. His brain is like a half-eaten omelet inside the skull of a 7-year-old.\"\n\nSaid Jackman, \"I'm going to be responsible here. Don't bring a 2-year-old,\" and Levy joked, \"Okay, fine. We draw the line at 3.\" Reynolds further quipped, \"Don't bring a 114-year-old, because that person will not leave alive. Anyone in a diaper.\"\n\nRead on for what parents should know before taking the family to see Deadpool & Wolverine, in theaters now. (Warning: Some spoilers ahead.)\n\nThere is frequent bloody violence\n\nThroughout the movie, there are gory, over-the-top violence and action scenes, often played for laughs. (The opening action scene features Deadpool dancing along to *NSYNC while killing countless adversaries.)\n\nThere are guns, claws, swords galore. Mutant characters also use their powers to fight in bloody fashion.\n\nNonstop coarse language is used\n\nReynolds' Deadpool character isn't nicknamed the Merc with a Mouth for nothing. There is an onslaught of F-bombs from start to finish, plus every other vulgarity in between.\n\nDirector Levy joked to Variety, \"Ryan has a superpower of being able to invent forms of swearing that humankind has never known.\"\n\nThere are many sexual references\n\nAnother hallmark of the Deadpool brand of humor are irreverent sexual jokes. There are references to erections, sexual harassment, genitals and other sex acts. Parts of Wolverine's mask, for example, are referred to as \"blowjob handles\" at one point.\n\nProducer Kevin Feige, the president of Marvel Studios, told Variety he had to explain what \"pegging\" is to some people at the company because of a joke used in the movie.\n\n\"There's a line in the red-band trailer -- you don't have to write this in the article, for crying out loud -- about pegging,\" Feige told the outlet. \"I know what pegging is, it's in the first Deadpool movie. But there were people I work with who didn't know what it was. I had to explain it to them.\"\n\nThere are some mentions of drug use\n\nThere are several mentions of cocaine throughout the film, as Leslie Uggams' character Blind Al and Deadpool talk about the drug and give it code names. One of those pseudonyms, for example, is \"the Devil's dandruff.\"\n\nA joke in the movie suggests producer Feige forbid them from cocaine references in the film. He told Variety, \"We were open to anything. Maybe I'm slightly prudish when it comes to drug use, but I was like, 'Eh, it's not that funny.' \"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benjamin_vanhoose@people.com", "name": "Benjamin VanHoose", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphic violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSYNC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NSYNC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Uggams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leslie Uggams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower_(ability)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower (ability)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fellatio", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fellatio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudonym", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pseudonym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_harassment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual harassment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cocaine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/-ZVivBiIGSICAYz-4cu2_W-Dij8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/deadpool-and-wolverine-283-07232024-0d91ebb77439491bb4a687bbda58c7e4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

The snarky, fourth-wall-breaking superhero is back, this time with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine in a pairing that's seemed inevitable from the beginning. Many critics considered it the \"ultimate Deadpool movie\" following initial screenings, and that means that despite some flaws in the story, audiences can expect to laugh. In fact, those who have seen the movie say Reynolds' character comes so hard (heh) with the jokes that a second viewing is a necessity.\n\nMuch in the same way that Barbie took shots at Mattel in one of 2023's best movies, Ryan Reynolds apparently doesn't pull too many punches on the MCU in this one, so grab your wild Deadpool 3 popcorn bucket, and let's see what critics have to say, starting with CinemaBlend's review of Deadpool & Wolverine. Eric Eisenberg gives it 3.5 stars out of 5, noting the film's gratuitous fan service and complete mess of a narrative. However, it's still a \"raucous good time,\" made palatable with a healthy dose of self-awareness. He says:\n\nDavid Ehrlich of IndieWire gives it a C+ for thin plotting and other story issues, but agrees that fans will be won over by the humor and cameos, one of which left the critic crying with laughter in his screening. Ehrlich writes:\n\nPete Hammond of Deadline loves Deadpool & Wolverine's salty dialogue, and while Hugh Jackman is \"perfection\" as the clawed superhero, it's the glee Ryan Reynolds takes in bringing his character's crude humor and off-color jokes to the MCU that makes this movie so enjoyable. In the critic's words:\n\nTom Jorgensen of IGN rates it a \"Good\" 7 out of 10, and while this critic thinks Ryan Reynolds may have sanded off the edges of a few of his jokes, what his character does bring to the table breathes new, menacing life into the MCU. Jorgensen continues:\n\nJohn Kirk of Original Cin gives it an A, saying that fans ultimately aren't going to care that the story is weak, because the fights are massive and the jokes are flying nonstop. In Kirk's words:\n\nWhether you've seen all of the Marvel movies in order or just the first two Deadpool movies (which can be streamed with a Disney+ subscription), the critics seem to agree that Ryan Reynolds' irreverent superhero is back at full strength with his quips in Deadpool & Wolverine.

The movie, directed by Shawn Levy, is projected to have the best ever domestic opening weekend for an R-rated film.\n\nMost critics have found something to like in \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" which has an 81 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. They say it has a superpowered jokes-per-minute ratio and two winning performances from its lead actors. But many reviewers had a mixed-to-negative assessment of the movie overall, calling it difficult to follow, lacking in real tension or stakes and overly reliant on self-referential story lines.\n\nThe movie's aggressive sense of humor about itself may win you over despite its flaws. \"'Deadpool & Wolverine' isn't a particularly good movie -- I'm not even sure it is a movie,\" Bilge Ebiri wrote. \"But it's so determined to beat you down with its incessant irreverence that you might find yourself submitting to it.\"\n\nNothing Ever Ends [The New York Times]\n\nThe movie's existence reflects Hollywood's inability to \"let well enough alone,\" wrote Alissa Wilkinson, but it's entertaining nonetheless. \"It still features Reynolds making fun of himself; it has some fun set pieces, clever sight gags, amusing surprises, left-field references and adoring pauses to admire Jackman's biceps and abs.\"\n\n'Deadpool & Wolverine' Makes the M.C.U. the Villain -- and Not in a Good Way [Polygon]\n\nIn a negative review, Joshua Rivera found the film dispiritingly hollow. \"'Deadpool & Wolverine' has made its hero the worst kind of comic book character: one who doesn't stand for anything.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's Sarky Gagathon Mocks the M.C.U. Back to Life [The Guardian]\n\nPeter Bradshaw appreciated the movie's satirical bent while capturing a common complaint about it in a few words. \"It's amusing and exhausting,\" he wrote.\n\nThe Superhero Movie Finally Accepts Itself for What It Is [The Associated Press]\n\nIn a mixed review, Krysta Fauria said the film loses its way in the middle but ultimately sticks the landing. \"The bloody but comedic final fight scene, however, is enough to perk viewers back up for the last act, solidifying the film's identity as a fun, generally well-made summer movie.\"\n\nRyan Reynolds Blasts Into the M.C.U. with a Meta-Sequel That Nakedly Tries to Save Superhero Movies From Extinction [IndieWire]\n\nDavid Ehrlich found a kernel of tenderness beneath the lewd and crude action. \"'Deadpool & Wolverine' rescues something kind of beautiful from the ugliness that superhero movies have perpetuated for so long.\"\n\nRelentlessly Irritating, With Cheap Jokes Instead of Stake [Entertainment Weekly]\n\nThe film left a bad taste in the mouth of Jordan Hoffman, who found it \"simply too repetitive, too immature and too irritating to enjoy.\" \"It's unbelievable just how annoying it is,\" he wrote.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's R-Rated Bromance Is an Irreverent Send-Off to Fox's X-Men Movies [Variety]\n\nDeadpool's desire in the film to leave a meaningful legacy is a compelling microcosm of the challenge facing all superhero stories, which are \"at the mercy of both Marvel and the market,\" wrote Peter Debruge. \"In its own uniquely self-aware way, the movie confronts that phenomenon without overstaying its welcome.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, the MCU's fortunes have faltered since 2019 and the $2 billion heyday of Avengers: Endgame. Audiences and takings are down, with last year's The Marvels barely making $200 million and already announced titles delayed by years.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine is the only MCU film out this year, so the notion that Ryan Reynolds's lewd, rude Merc with a Mouth will be Disney-Marvel's saviour is not a ludicrous one. Indeed, Reynolds spells it out with typical fourth-wall-smashing gusto from the start, when he declares himself the \"Marvel Jesus\" after being enlisted to help the Time Variance Authority with their multiversal problems.\n\nFollowers of the Loki TV series will already know about the TVA and its mission to protect the Multiverse by trimming failing alternate realities. But when Wade Wilson (aka Deadpool) realises TVA agent Mr Paradox (played by Succession star Matthew Macfadyen) is threatening the lives of his friends and his lover (Morena Baccarin), he decides he will need muscular assistance from iconic X-Man the Wolverine (a welcome return for Hugh Jackman). But, hold on. Wasn't Logan in 2017 the final chapter for Jackman's ageing mutant mauler? Well, yes and no, as we see from the bloody, all-action opening when Wade revisits Logan's final resting place in the hope his healing factor might have kicked in. Let's just say Wade must look elsewhere in the multiverse, so we get the chance to check out a range of Wolverine variants that will be familiar to many a longtime comic book fan.\n\nEventually, it's a bitter, booze-guzzling Logan -- \"the worst Wolverine\" -- who is persuaded to help, and then this very funny, action-packed romp hurtles into its own as the pair bicker and battle with each other and nearly everyone else they meet after they are dumped into The Void, an inter-dimensional dumping ground ruled over by psychic psycho Cassandra Nova (The Crown's Emma Corrin).\n\nHere, the self-aware send-ups come thick and fast - the duo fight in the rubble of the 20th Century Fox logo - as do some genuinely gob-smacking cameos and callbacks to Marvel's cinematic history. The wanton slice-and-dice violence, expletives on tap and throwaway gibes at the likes of Marvel chief Kevin Feige and Mad Max film Furiosa quell any concerns Deadpool may get Disneyfied.\n\nAdmittedly, the in-jokes and quickfire banter may not travel so well for the uninitiated punter, but like Airplane!, there is enough pithy patter and gags (deftly delivered by director Shawn Levy) to leave you smiling or laughing out loud. Reynolds, meanwhile, is at his impish best, and he has the perfect foil in a suitably gruff Jackman, who provides timely gravitas among all the mirth and mayhem.\n\nTime (and billion-dollar box office targets) will tell if Deadpool is indeed the saviour of the MCU and can get lots of bums onto lots of seats. Or will this third outing be just a fillip before the release of Captain America: Brave New World in February 2025, which will see Anthony Mackie take on the mantle of the star-spangled Avenger?

That's a more open question, and one that Kevin Feige is asking. was asked by Discussing Film about the possibility of Wolverine one day getting a new actor. Here's what he said:\n\nYeah. You know, Marvel is celebrating its 85th anniversary later this summer. That's just the first 85 years, and Disney just celebrated its 100th anniversary as well. I think these characters will be around for another 100 years, long after all of us. So, for sure, there will be [eventually another actor as Wolverine]. I think it will be in a very different style and in a different way. I also think if someone tried to do an imitation of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, that would be a big mistake.\n\nHe then has a follow-up quote saying essentially the same thing, although there is no immediate plans to replace Jackman:\n\nAs comic book readers know, there have been various and very different versions of these characters over the decades. It would be fun to explore more of them someday. Again, we don't have immediate plans by all means. But in the coming decades, I think it is inevitable. If it happens, it will have to be a very different and bold reinterpretation of [the character] because no one will be as good as Hugh Jackman at doing his own version of Wolverine.\n\n< position=\"inread\" progressive=\"\" ad-id=\"article-0-inread\" aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"presentation\"/>\n\nA lot of things are open to interpretation here. When you're talking about the character still being around 100 years from now, sure, it makes sense that you'd factor in people who aren't Hugh Jackman. But I don't think that necessarily means Jackman couldn't play Wolverine in other X-Men movies for another five years or so?\n\nThe second quote also makes me think about this sentence: As comic book readers know, there have been various and very, very different versions of these characters over the decades. It would be fun to explore more of them someday.\n\nWhen it comes to Wolverine, the most different take on the character is Laura Kinney, X-23, taking over the role of Wolverine from the comics, something the Marvel Universe has already set up with Logan and now Dafne Keens' take on Laura in Deadpool and Wolverine. I've said before that she's the only actress who makes sense to take over the role in the near future, and I wonder if Feige is hinting at that.\n\nI'd be shocked if we didn't get Jackman's Wolverine in the next Avengers movies or early in the future X-Men movies. Sure, he could be recast someday, but I'm not sure that day will even be the rest of this decade.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/669e6dd986057c2d71a57b80/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nAfter the movie ends, fans are treated to archival footage from past Marvel films before an end credits scene. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe credits roll alongside behind-the-scenes footage from the 'X-Men' movies and other past Marvel films\n\nJackman has played Wolverine since the 2000 ensemble movie \"X-Men.\" He reprised the role for additional \"X-Men\" sequels and the stand-alone Wolverine franchise. Although the character sacrificed himself in the 2017 movie \"Logan,\" Jackman returns as a Wolverine variant in \"Deadpool & Wolverine.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Reynolds made his debut as Wade Wilson in \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" in 2009. Years later, he overhauled the character and gave the Merc with a Mouth new life in a wildly successful \"Deadpool\" franchise.\n\nThe footage shown to the right of the credits pays homage to their lengthy Marvel careers, to the tune of Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\"\n\nThe montage includes footage of Jackman on the set of the \"X-Men\" movies with Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier/Professor X), Halle Berry (Storm), and his other costars. It also features footage of Chris Evans on the set of the original \"Fantastic Four\" films and snippets of scenes from the \"Fantastic Four\" reboot, \"X-Men: Apocalypse,\" \"X-Men: Dark Phoenix,\" and other Marvel movies.\n\nIt concludes with the 20th Century Fox logo, in yet another meta jab at the 2019 Disney/Fox merger.\n\nThe end-credits scene gives Chris Evans even more screen time as Johnny Storm\n\nIn \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" Chris Evans reprises his role as the lovable-yet-cocky Johnny Storm/Human Torch. Although the actor is primarily associated with his part as Steve Rogers/Captain America in the MCU, he previously played Johnny in \"Fantastic Four\" (2005) and \"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\" (2007).\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine encounter Johnny in a wasteland called The Void. Then they're captured and taken to the lair of villain Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin).\n\nWhile in the convoy together, Johnny explains that The Void is a metaphysical junkyard where people are sent by the Time Variance Authority (TVA) before being annihilated by an entity known as Alioth. He says that people who end up here are either eaten by Alioth or work for Cassandra.\n\nWhen Deadpool meets Cassandra, he repeats all the rude comments that Johnny made about her in the convoy verbatim. Johnny denies speaking out against Cassandra, but she viciously kills him anyway by ripping the skin from his body telepathically leaving behind his skeleton and a puddle of blood.\n\nMarvel end-credits scenes often tease what's to come in future projects. Other times, they're tongue-in-cheek scenes that are inconsequential.\n\nThe \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" end-credits scene milks Evans' cameo for everything it's worth by elaborating on the moment that led to Johnny's brutal death.\n\nIn the scene, Wade stands inside the TVA room alone and breaks the fourth wall, telling the audience that he's tired of the rumors that he got Johnny killed. To prove that he wasn't lying about everything Johnny said, Deadpool plays back footage from the convoy on one of the TVA's retro TVs. The footage clearly shows Johnny going on a crude, expletive-filled rant about why he despises Cassandra.\n\nIt's unclear where in the MCU Deadpool will show up next, but he's clearly satisfied with the way this film ends.\n\n\"Gotcha, fuckface,\" Deadpool says before walking away.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_singh@businessinsider.com", "name": "Olivia Singh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock footage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Xavier_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charles Xavier (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_21st_Century_Fox_by_Disney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Riddance_(Time_of_Your_Life)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Phoenix_Saga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Dark Phoenix Saga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Homage (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four:_Rise_of_the_Silver_Surfer_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apocalypse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reboot (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Halle Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teams_and_organizations_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teams and organizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Corrin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emma Corrin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telepathy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a0094480d4d5da13d672ad?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

On the convention's preview night, scores of fans were sporting clothing or costumes featuring the movie's characters.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who play the titular superheroes, will join director Shawn Levy in the San Diego Convention Center's famed Hall H Thursday. To prevent fans from camping out in lines all day to snag a seat, organizers created a lottery system for the chance to win tickets. The venue holds about 6,000 people.\n\nSome fans, conditioned to expect surprise guests and never-before-seen footage from years of experience at the convention, are speculating the panel will be followed by a screening of the film, which hits theaters Friday.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" marks the debut of Reynolds and Jackman's characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are the subject of several jokes throughout the trailer. Both Deadpool and Wolverine's characters existed in films previously under the 21st Century Fox banner.\n\nThe release comes at a time of increasing conversations about a general \"superhero fatigue,\" with audiences showing less enthusiasm for superhero movies both within the MCU and beyond. Part of that fatigue comes from a feeling that to understand a superhero movie today requires background research into the lore of the characters and comics, with much required viewing and reading.\n\nLevy said in an April interview with The Associated Press that he wanted to make sure his movie didn't require that intense level of preparation.\n\n\"I was a good student in school. I'll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,\" Levy said.\n\n\"I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn't want to presume that. This movie is built for entertainment, with no obligation to come prepared with prior research.\"\n\nAlthough Marvel is anxious for a hit following box-office underperformance in of \"The Marvels\" and \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" in 2023, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is tracking to open in the $160 million range. That would unseat \"Inside Out 2\" for the biggest opening of the year -- and quash any discussion of superhero fatigue.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlyn_huamani@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Kaitlyn Huamani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Convention_Center", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Convention Center"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_Century_Fox", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "21st Century Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant-Man_and_the_Wasp:_Quantumania", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvels", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Marvels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Other_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Other Media", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9CP5XfiYSga3ta5NdXQP2A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/2c31d46a5a07f04c6835dea3f97b55d1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

He only wants to matter when fate crosses his path with the TVA (Time Variance Authority) where he meets Mr. Paradox (Played by Matthew Macfadyen).\n\nThe TVA agent wants to eviscerate Wade Wilson's universe and while divulging his plans an unexpected cameo of Thor aka Chris Hemsworth occurs. His appearance is marked in archival footage of sorts, played digitally on a screen, where the God of Thunder is seemingly crying holding Deadpool's body. When Wade Wilson's watches the scene play, he quickly asks Mr. Paradox for an explanation.\n\nDeadpool only gets told that the scene is from a distant future, nothing more is elaborated. Even though the question \"Why was Thor crying\" is brought up multiple times, it only holds the value of a theatrical gimmick in the movie. However, the scene has now opened a window for Deadpool's potential cameo in a future Avengers film.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Vidhyatharan P (@pvilly_artist)\n\nNotably, this scene was already a talk of the town even before the film's release after Marvel screened a 9-minute exclusive footage of Deadpool 3 at the Cinemacon event. Thor crying over Deadpool's body scene was inclusive in the special screening.\n\nWhen it comes to Deadpool and Wolverine's feature in future Avengers movies, Reynolds previously told Variety, \"I don't know. Yeah, we'll see.\" Meanwhile, Hugh Jackman added, \"I'm not sure how to answer.\"\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine premieres on July 26.

Is it another throw-away gag, or could it perhaps be something hinting at bigger things to come for the character now he's been fully folded into the franchise?\n\nRead on for everything you need to know about the Deadpool & Wolverine post-credits scene.\n\nDoes Deadpool & Wolverine have a post-credits scene?\n\nYes! During the credits themselves, we are shown a montage scored by classic Green Day hit Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) which consists of behind-the-scenes footage from previous X-Men and other Fox Marvel films - with younger Hugh Jackman and Ryan Reynolds both appearing. It's a huge treat for fans of the films.\n\nAnd after that, there is indeed one final post-credits scene, which very much falls into the joke category rather than anything more substantial.\n\nIt's a call-back to an earlier moment in the film, with Deadpool desperate to clear his name after being accused of putting words in Johnny Storm's (Chris Evans) mouth which had led to his brutal death at the hands of Cassandra Nova.\n\nIn that scene, Deadpool had accused Johnny of saying all sorts of extremely vulgar and foul-mouthed things about the villain, which Johnny fruitlessly protested had been completely fabricated. In the aftermath, Deadpool had faced plenty of flak from Logan for supposedly making this up and directly causing Johnny's death.\n\nWell, the post-credits sting sees Deadpool return to the TVA to review the footage and prove he'd actually not made up a thing: Johnny had uttered every single insult he'd been accused of, word-for-word. And with no shortage of gusto!\n\nSo while this doesn't exactly bring Johnny back from his violent demise, at the very least it shows that Deadpool hadn't been dishonest about his remarks.

On the convention's preview night, scores of fans were sporting clothing or costumes featuring the movie's characters.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nRyan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, who play the titular superheroes, will join director Shawn Levy in the San Diego Convention Center's famed Hall H Thursday. To prevent fans from camping out in lines all day to snag a seat, organizers created a lottery system for the chance to win tickets. The venue holds about 6,000 people.\n\nSome fans, conditioned to expect surprise guests and never-before-seen footage from years of experience at the convention, are speculating the panel will be followed by a screening of the film, which hits theaters Friday.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" marks the debut of Reynolds and Jackman's characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Disney and the Marvel Cinematic Universe are the subject of several jokes throughout the trailer. Both Deadpool and Wolverine's characters existed in films previously under the 21st Century Fox banner.\n\nThe release comes at a time of increasing conversations about a general \"superhero fatigue,\" with audiences showing less enthusiasm for superhero movies both within the MCU and beyond. Part of that fatigue comes from a feeling that to understand a superhero movie today requires background research into the lore of the characters and comics, with much required viewing and reading.\n\nLevy said in an April interview with The Associated Press that he wanted to make sure his movie didn't require that intense level of preparation.\n\n\"I was a good student in school. I'll do my homework as an adult. But I am definitely not looking to do homework when I go to the movies,\" Levy said.\n\n\"I very much made this film with certainly a healthy respect and gratitude towards the rabid fan base that has peak fluency in the mythology and lore of these characters and this world. But I didn't want to presume that.

While being interviewed, Reynolds, who also served as a producer and writer on the film, revealed Deadpool & Wolverine was originally supposed to be titled Deadpool & Friend.\n\nBut the night before they released the first full trailer on Super Bowl Sunday, the title leaked because of \"the son of bitches on the internet,\" Reynolds said, and people \"fucking hated that title.\"\n\n\"We were not feeling so good about that anymore, and it went with the trailer that we were showing. It was kind of a perfect title for the first piece of materials we had out there,\" he continued, \"So, Shawn Levy -- director extraordinaire, friend to both of us and dear friend, literally one of our best friends in the whole world -- he and I had been sitting in the edit room for months at this point, and we called everybody at Disney and Marvel and said we have to change the title, and they were like, 'Well no guys. It launches tomorrow.'\"\n\nAfter the frequent collaborators insisted they did not want to release the film with that title, Disney caved and made it work from one day to the next.\n\nWhile the Free Guy star and producer admitted to Jackman that he enjoys writing, he struggled to write for his iconic character, Wolverine.\n\n\"One of the scariest things I've ever done in my life is writing for you,\" Reynolds noted. \"Well, Wolverine, you've got a legacy there that is really, I mean, one of the most, I think, one of the most iconic legacies in all comic book movies.\"\n\nThroughout the show, the men took several, playful jabs at each other but also had a few genuinely heartfelt moments where they discussed their experiences working together. They also interviewed their co-star Emma Corrin.\n\n\"You're one of one, my friend,\" Jackman told Reynolds toward the end of interviewing him, to which The Adam Project star responded: \"A front-row seat to Hugh Jackman is the greatest gift on earth. I mean it. I hug him, and I become 20 percent better of a person. What you see is what you get here,\" adding that's not typically the case with people in Hollywood.\n\nWhen Reynolds interviewed Jackman, the two recalled meeting on the set of X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Greatest Showman star joked that he didn't talk to his now-friend because he wasn't famous yet. Reynolds also jokingly asked Jackman how it feels to know that everyone knows he's a liar since he said he had retired the role of Wolverine after Logan but then came back to it for Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nThe L\u00e9s Miserables actor admitted it was \"terrifying\" to return to the clawed superhero for the movie because he was really proud of how Logan ended and thought they had stuck the landing.\n\n\"But the honest truth is three days after announcing [I was retiring Wolverine], I saw Deadpool one in the cinema, I was like, 'Oops,' because I could just see it,\" he shared. \"I've never had more fun playing the character.\"\n\nReynolds echoed the sentiment, saying the film is \"the most special experience I've ever had in my life. ... I genuinely had the best time in my entire life, and I actually don't know how I'm ever supposed to go do another film ever again without you.\"\n\nDuring their opening monologue, the actors talked about their naughty Wolverine popcorn bucket that \"people are really gonna fuck\"; admitted how they \"cannot wait\" for audiences to see the film that people are saying could save the Marvel Cinematic Universe but joked it couldn't save democracy because \"democracy's dead\"; and took questions from children on the street.\n\nWhen a child was shown headshots of the two men, he asked who they were, and Jackman jokingly took that a little personally: \"I'm the guy whose Walk of Fame star you're standing on, you little shit.\"\n\nAs for Reynolds, he took a second to answer the question in the most dramatically silly way, saying, \"Who are we? We're the outgrowth of severe childhood trauma, who have toiled away in this vapid, morally bankrupt industry for the past 25 years, and now we have enough money to get away with literally anything. We could buy your childhood home and burn it to the ground. You think Jimmy Kimmel is really on vacation? He's dead. We killed him.

The Los Angeles Times describes it as \"manic meta mush,\" and TheWrap calls it an exercise in \"corporate synergy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Vulture damns it with this faint praise: \"It's so determined to beat you down with its incessant irreverence that you might find yourself submitting to it.\"\n\nBut repeat after us: This will not matter. Who cares about critics? Not this target audience. Fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and others will show up in droves, likely pushing the R-rated movie to record-breaking receipts. Box-office projections range from $160 million to $200 million in the U.S. alone, per Variety, which will provide a much-needed boost to the struggling American theater business.\n\nBrands, not surprisingly, want to collaborate with this blockbuster franchise, which can't attract many family-friendly sponsors because of its over-the-top violence and profanity. But its billion-dollar history and the star power of real-life close friends Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman have helped draw in a raft of partners across booze, fast food and gaming, among other categories.\n\nReynolds himself is no stranger to the marketing industry, having launched creative shop Maximum Effort and invested in brands including Aviation American Gin, Mint Mobile and Wrexham FC. Maximum Effort does much of the heavy lifting for Deadpool, starting with a Super Bowl teaser in February that snagged 365 million views in 24 hours, becoming the most-watched trailer of all time.\n\nADWEEK has rounded up some of the most notable swag and promotions tied to the flick, which opens Friday. Grab some popcorn -- in a limited-edition Deadpool & Wolverine souvenir bucket, of course -- and dig in.\n\nIt's no surprise that Reynolds' Aviation American Gin would get in on the act, as the distiller released six specialty bottles inspired by the film. The Deadpool bottle was released first, featuring a colored label that pops as red as Deadpool's skin-tight costume. More recently, Wolverine got his own pour, featuring the yellow of Wolverine's suit on the label. Both have logo likenesses of the characters against a black bottle design that strays from the usual Aviation clear bottle.\n\nThe bottles were designed by Maximum Effort and Portland, Ore.-based design studio Sandstrom Partners. They are available for purchase in retailers in Florida, California, Texas, New York and Oregon.\n\nAnother Maximum Effort effort plays off Reynolds' Canadian-ness. The ad for the coffee giant finds Deadpool sitting on a couch, stating that now that Deadpool is coming out, the character is done with Reynolds, so he's giving him back so that he is free to do \"some stuff\" with Tim Hortons. He then jokes that, after three decades in show business, he's been sucked \"pretty dry,\" but still has some will to live. Maybe Tim Hortons coffee will perk him up.\n\nFrozen pizza brand DiGiorno invites Deadpool and Wolverine into its universe, with help from Publicis and Hogarth. The team has come out with a Deadpool & Wolverine-inspired pizza line that pays homage to the flick with some Easter eggs, and a campaign to promote it. \"Hot & Steamy\" finds two people eating the pizzas while being fed by Deadpool.\n\nThe Marvel apparel universe delivers Deadpool & Wolverine shirts with custom designs from Homage, billed as \"where Maximum Effort meets Maximum Comfort.\" The collection, Threadpool, is the first collaboration between Maximum Effort and Homage.\n\nXbox partnered with Marvel Entertainment's resident \"Merc with a Mouth\" for a wireless controller to celebrate the release of the movie. The shape is reminiscent of Deadpool's backside, and it's named the Cheeky Controller. Getting one was only attainable by entering a global sweepstakes, as outlined on Xbox Wire. The ample, and well-rounded controller now has a version for Wolverine, giving Jackman gamer fans a reason to celebrate.\n\nTaking Wolverine's claws makes him angry, but perhaps a nice brew will calm him down. That's the concept behind the story of a humorous ad for Heineken Silver. As the two characters get ready to square off in a fight, Wolverine realizes that he can't produce his claws. Deadpool tries to calm him down by telling him he took the adamantium to make the cans for a couple of refreshing Heineken Silver beers. As they sip together to the strains of \"Just the Two of Us,\" Wolverine insists that he would rather fight.\n\nThe signature red and yellow suits spawned a cheeky tie-in with a consumer packaged goods behemoth, which noted that the Deadpool and Wolverine characters \"look a lot like another iconic duo: Heinz ketchup and mustard.\"\n\nIn a first for the legacy brand, Heinz created limited-edition collectibles that let fans accessorize their condiment bottles to look like the warring superheroes. Tiny add-ons include Deadpool's mask, suit and, most important, katanas, tailor-made for ketchup bottles. Wolverine's claws, suit and mask are available for mustard cosplay.\n\nInspiration came from social media, according to Lizzy Goodman, brand communications manager for Heinz U.S. at Kraft Heinz. \"Once we made that connection, we couldn't unsee it, as these similarities go beyond color,\" she said in a statement. \"One's sweet, one's zesty -- everybody has a favorite, but really, they're better together.\"\n\nThe promo debuted earlier this month with a fourth wall-breaking spot, called \"Now You Can't Unsee It,\" with narration from Reynolds.\n\nThe personal care brand has already aligned successfully with big-screen and streaming hits of the recent past, including Thor, Dungeons and Dragons and The Witcher. For its first link to the Deadpool milieu, Old Spice centers on a beloved and underused supporting character: Blind Al, played by acting legend Leslie Uggams.\n\nBlind Al, known for having a nose for nonsense, can't see Deadpool but she sure can smell him. Her solution is to offer her roomie a can of Old Spice Total Body Deodorant because it \"fights stank 24/7,\" she says in the brand's commercial, which draws heavily on clips from the flick.\n\nThe fast-food chain gave Deadpool a bobble-headed makeover, modeled after its wise-cracking mascot, and introduced a limited-time menu item called Mini Chimi Bang Bangs to herald the movie's release. The Mexican-themed \"tiny option\" snacks, spawned from Deadpool's devotion to chimichangas, will be available through Sept. 15.\n\nThe brand's loyalty club, known as Jack Pack, can get special perks like $5 Fandango credits and special Deadpool & Wolverine packaging for spicy chicken strips and waffle sticks, \"since great things come in unexpected combinations.\"", "source": {"uri": "adweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Adweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "t_l_stanley@adweek.com", "name": "T.L.

But how does the upcoming threequel fit in the timeline?\n\nHype is skyrocketing for Marvel Studios' next Phase 5 foray, which will see the return of Ryan Reynolds' Wade Wilson for a R-rated Multiversal romp alongside Hugh Jackman's Logan. It's up to \"Marvel Jesus\" to save the franchise from disaster, as a string of underwhelming movies and Disney+ shows have left audiences disillusioned with the state of the MCU. And considering that this is the first Disney-backed Deadpool project since the IP was freed from the shackles of Fox, expectations are undoubtedly high.\n\nThankfully, early viewers seem to have nothing but praise for the film, which, let's be real -- was never really a concern. The first two Deadpool movies grossed well over $700 million at the box office, making the Merc with a Mouth's third outing something of a no-brainer. Director Shawn Levy even hinted that he'll be returning to Marvel down the line (perhaps, for Avengers 5?), which also seems to suggest that the events of Deadpool & Wolverine will play a big role in what's next to come. So where does the blockbuster fall on the MCU timeline, and how will it connect to the remainder of the Multiverse Saga?\n\nOkay, buckle in, 'cause this is about to get confusing. Early in the film, Wade meets with a familiar face circa March 2018 -- on the Sacred Timeline, that is. Factoring in the 20th Century Fox universe, this is roughly two years after the events of Deadpool 2. We then skip forward six years to Earth-10005, putting us in March 2024, a.k.a. five or so months post-Avengers: Endgame. From there, time gets a whole lot harder to keep track of, given the involvement of the TVA. You can connect the dots, but keep in mind that timelines are all over the place here, so take these reference points with a grain of salt.\n\nFourth wall breaking, gory action sequences, MCU in-jokes ... Deadpool & Wolverine is practically guaranteed to be a fun time at the movies. But with rumored X-Men cameos and tie-ins to the TVA and the Disney+ Loki series, its place on the Marvel timeline might be a huge indicator that Wade and Co. might be key players in the (alleged) Multiversal Army in Avengers: Secret Wars. While nothing has been outright confirmed, I'm going to need some answers from Kevin Feige, stat. Here's hoping we learn more during Marvel's panel at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amanda_landwehr@themarysue.com", "name": "Amanda Landwehr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnite", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortnite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xbox (console)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMC (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adidas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disney+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_2_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tie-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tie-in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Disney", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Disney", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Media_Conglomerates", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Media Conglomerates", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Production", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/deadpool-wolverine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 1528, "textEnd": 1538}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But when Disney finalized the purchase of 21st Century Fox and their media properties in 2019, that included an opportunity to bring characters into the MCU who had yet to crossover with the Avengers. While we've seen the likes of Professor X popping up as part of the Illuminati in \"Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\" since then, \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is the first time that we've gotten major characters leading a story that ties directly to the MCU. But it's also a showcase for several superheroes from Fox's Marvel movies, giving them a proper farewell now that the MCU is overhauling all of their franchises, and the first one we encounter (besides various Wolverine variants), is quite the surprise.\n\nAfter Deadpool and Wolverine engage in an all out brawl in The Void, the desolate wasteland where things are sent after being pruned from their timelines by the Time Variance Authority (from Marvel's \"Loki\" TV series), they encounter a mysterious hooded character who warns them about an incoming brigade of marauders (though not the proper Marauders). Fans likely recognized the voice of Chris Evans as the character, and the implication is that he's playing a variant of Captain America. However, rather than saying \"Avengers assemble\" in a key moment of action, he shouts, \"Flame on!\"\n\nIt's Johnny Storm, aka Human Torch from one of the \"Fantastic Four\" movies, and he's still a cocky rascal. Sadly, Johnny doesn't last long, having his skin ripped off his body with the snap of his fingers by villain Cassandra Nova.

As Reynolds reprises his role as Wade Wilson, aka Deadpool, he delves into the character's emotional journey, exploring themes of vulnerability and shame that resonate with audiences.\n\nIn a recent press conference, Reynolds reflected on the evolution of Deadpool, particularly in this new installment. He noted that Wade Wilson has always possessed a certain emotional complexity.\n\n\"I think this character's always been kind of emotional. If you don't backstop a character like this with real vulnerability and emotion, then you know, that's the plant. It's very hard to give people the payoff, which is that he is kind of audacious and completely different.\" Reynolds stated, emphasizing the importance of vulnerability in portraying the mercurial anti-hero.\n\nThis emotional undercurrent is crucial for a character who oscillates between humor and philosophical musings. Reynolds pointed out that Deadpool, despite his audacious personality, is fundamentally a character grappling with shame. \"And, you know, can be philosophical in one moment and then, you know, have the brain of a half-eaten ham sandwich in the next. Like, he's a very unpredictable and mercurial character. But to me, the thing that always brings him close to my heart and I think other people is his vulnerability, is that he is a character in a shame spiral. And so much of what he's doing is based on his avoidance and maladaptive coping mechanisms around that shame.\" Reynolds explained, highlighting how Deadpool's comedic antics often serve as a coping mechanism for deeper emotional struggles.\n\nReynolds also remarked \"And you know, his face is hideous. He wears a mask to cover it up. You know, I think that also gives us license to play around with the comedy.\"\n\nThe film introduces Wolverine, portrayed by Hugh Jackman, who shares a similar emotional burden with Deadpool. Ryan Reynolds noted that both characters are driven by their respective experiences of shame, albeit in different ways.\n\nHe stated, \"Wolverine and Deadpool are more similar than different, in the sense that their big shadow is shame. The thing they are running away from is shame, and they just handle it in very different ways. I was more interested in what these two characters had in common as we went into this movie than what they didn't. I think that's the thing that's more interesting, and it also speaks to the global issues we experience with everything being so divisive all the time\" This shared emotional landscape between Deadpool and Wolverine sets the stage for a compelling narrative that transcends mere superhero antics.\n\nRyan explained that the essence of this character lies in their vulnerability, which is central to their identity and narrative. \"This character's vulnerability is kind of everything.\"\n\nThe challenge for Reynolds and director Shawn Levy lies in honoring Wolverine's legacy while injecting the trademark humor that defines the Deadpool franchise. Set to release on July 26, 2024, Deadpool & Wolverine has generated considerable buzz among fans eager to see the dynamic between these two iconic characters.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine - Official Trailer\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

However, the 2024 summer blockbuster movie releases are not slowing down! Last week, Twisters dominated the box office earnings, bringing in over $81 million and dethroning Despicable Me 4 from the top seat after its three-week run as the lead earner. Although it's a safe bet that Deadpool & Wolverine will undoubtedly reign over the box office for the foreseeable future, that doesn't mean there aren't other great movies that you can watch in the theaters this weekend! If you don't like crowded opening night viewings or simply haven't gotten the chance to see some of the other releases from earlier in July, like Longlegs or Inside Out 2, or if you're looking for a less \"mainstream\" movie to watch, read on to find out what your options are this weekend!\n\n'Deadpool & Wolverine'\n\nThis year, Deadpool & Wolverine has been one of the most highly anticipated movies, especially after the 2024 Super Bowl teaser trailer and confirmation that Deadpool would be \"infiltrating the MCU.\" In Deadpool 2, we were introduced to Ryan Reynolds' titular character forming an elite team of superpowered humans (and a normal guy, Peter, played by Rob Delaney) called \"X-Force\" to combat Cable (Josh Brolin, a.k.a. Thanos). The film also featured cameos by characters from the X-Men franchise, including James McAvoy's Charles Xavier, Nicholas Hoult's Beast, and several others.\n\nThe third installment of the Deadpool franchise will continue to focus on \"X-Force,\" and will introduce more hilarious cameos from well-known actors from the MCU as well as bringing characters from the previous two films back. Now that every superhero movie has been dabbling in \"multiverse\" concepts, it's only fitting that Deadpool joins in on the fun! The love-hate \"best frenemy\" relationship that Ryan Reynolds has with Hugh Jackman is on full display in Deadpool & Wolverine, both in and out of character. The two of them will have to set aside their differences to battle a new character, Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin), who has telepathic and telekinetic powers and also happens to be the twin sister of Charles Xavier.\n\nIn addition to new characters like Cassandra Nova and Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfayden), there will be many appearances from beloved characters from the previous films, such as Dopinder (Karan Soni) the courageous cab driver, Wade's fianc\u00e9e, Vanessa (Monica Baccarin), Blind Al (Leslie Uggams), Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Yukio (Brianna Hildebrand and Shioli Kutsana, respectively), and Colossus (Stefan Kapi\u010di\u0107). There will also be many cameo appearances from actors who are reprising their Fox-produced Marvel films and MCU roles, so keep an eye out for nostalgic surprises in Deadpool & Wolverine!

This time, he is joined by Wolverine, portrayed by the O.G. actor Hugh Jackman. Besides him, the heroes will also be united by a female Deadpool and a dog who will be seen wearing a cute Deadpool costume. His name is Dogpool, and if you find this interesting, bear with us as we discuss who this new adorable version of Deadpool is, what is Dogpool's name and what his breed is.\n\nWho Is Dogpool\n\nMarvel Comics' Dogpool has appeared in some significant issues of Deadpool, such as Prelude to Deadpool Corps, Deadpool, Deadpool Family, and Deadpool Corps.\n\nMascara X is a company that makes cosmetic products, and it used Dogpool for testing purposes. As an animal, he couldn't handle the experiments well and got mutated. One day, an experiment almost killed the poor dog, and being a money-hungry organization, the people of Mascara X left Dogpool in a waste bin to die.\n\nSomehow, his new powers helped him survive, and eventually, he got hired by a circus where he would entertain the audience by performing some deadly acts. He worked at the circus until Earth-616 Deadpool hired him for the Deadpool Corps.\n\nLike Dogs share an unbreakable bond with kids in real life, Dogpool finds confort with Kidpool. They both, being members of Deadpool Corps, do wonders in the comic book. However, the comic books doesn't focus on Dogpool that much. However, we may get to learn more about this version of Deadpool through the movie.\n\nWhat Are the Powers of Dogpool\n\nIn comics, Dogpool has powers similar to Deadpool i.e. regeneration and durability. However, Dogpool's role in the comics is quite limited as he was killed in Deadpool Kills Deadpool Issue #1.\n\n\"The reason why I was a huge proponent for her was because she feels like the animal manifestation of Wade Wilson\"- Ryan Reynolds\n\nNothing is known about Peggy's role in Deadpool & Wolverine, but we can say that it will surely be a fun experience. That's because no one can deny that every film that features the fou-legged furballs certainly becomes everyone's favorite, and we can expect the anticipated film to get a better reception than the earlier ones.\n\nWhat Breed Is Dogpool in Deadpool 3\n\nDeadpool Dog or Peggy in Deadpool 3 is a Pug/Chinese Crested cross and she also has an Instagram account with her bio reading \"Merc with a bark\". However, the comics have not revealed the breed of the Dogpool.", "source": {"uri": "beebom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beebom"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aparna_ukil@beebom.com", "name": "Aparna Ukil", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earth-616"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mutation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://beebom.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Dogpool-Deadpool.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

However, instead of ushering in a new era of future MCU projects, the post-credit scene follows the tradition of the two previous Deadpool movies by landing a final joke and making a hilarious meta-commentary on the superhero industry.\n\nIn Deadpool & Wolverine, Wade Wilson discovers that Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) death in Logan threatens his timeline's existence. This revelation sets him on a collision course with the Time Variance Authority (TVA) as he searches for a replacement Wolverine from an alternate reality. The journey leads Wade and a new Wolverine to the Void, a desolate realm at the end of time ruled by the formidable Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). There, they encounter an unexpected ally: the Human Torch, portrayed by Chris Evans in a clever nod to his pre-Captain America superhero role.\n\nDuring their captivity in Cassandra's base, Wade seemingly betrays Johnny Storm by attributing a series of offensive remarks to him. The scene makes the audience believe that Wade is testing Cassandra's limits by cursing her in highly creative ways but putting the blame on the Human Torch just to be safe. This leads to a shocking display of Cassandra's powers, resulting in Johnny's apparent demise.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine post-credits scene nods at the Fox era of superhero movies\n\nAs the credits finish rolling, we're treated to a scene that's quintessentially Deadpool. Our antihero stands alone at the TVA, breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly. His mission? To clear his name and prove he wasn't responsible for Johnny's gruesome fate.\n\nDeadpool uses TVA technology to present evidence of his journey to Cassandra's base, when he has shared a cell with Johnny Storm and the new Logan. In a hilarious twist, it's revealed that Johnny did indeed utter all the offensive remarks Wade had attributed to him - and then some. The scene is a comedic goldmine, playing on the stark contrast between Chris Evans' portrayal of the wholesome Captain America and this foul-mouthed version of the Human Torch.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine stays true to its roots by delivering a punchline rather than a preview of future projects. It prioritizes humor and character development over universe-building, a refreshing approach in the interconnected world of superhero cinema. Even if we are all excited to see the Mutants join the Sacred Timeline of the MCU, it's good to watch a movie that tells a self-contained story once in a while.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marco_vito_oddo@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Marco Vito Oddo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teams_and_organizations_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teams and organizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Torch_(comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human Torch (comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parallel universes in fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Features of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antihero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Demoscene", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia/Demoscene", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Predictions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Deadpool-Wolverine-Hug.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Ryan Reynolds's third foray into his fourth-wall breaking franchise marks Deadpool's official entry into the MCU's larger universe -- and of course that meant his movie was going to be self-aware about everything going on in and around these movies, and of course that meant it was going to have a credits scene.\n\nThroughout the course of Deadpool & Wolverine, much is said about the state of the MCU as these new characters enter; at one point, Deadpool even tells Wolverine \"Welcome to the MCU -- you're entering at something of a lowpoint.\" He later mocks the MCU's attempt to launch \"The Multiverse Saga\" off the ground, saying that it's just been \"miss after miss.\" Again: self-aware.\n\nBy the end of the movie, of course, a lot happens: character arcs begin and end, heroes rise, villains are defeated, and there are cameos -- lots and lots of cameos. (Though, technically, a lot of them aren't even \"cameos,\" technically, because the surprise appearances last more than just a single scene or moment).\n\nBut you didn't think the most self-aware MCU project ever wouldn't have a credits scene, of all things, did you?\n\nIt does! Deadpool & Wolverine has one mid-credits montage (so, kind of a mid-credits scene), and then another proper credits scene at the very end.\n\nThe first \"credits scene\" -- it runs simultaneous to the film's closing credits -- is a montage of behind-the-scenes footage of past Marvel films set to Green Day's timeless ballad \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).\" The montage features old clips from the making of films that featured many of the characters featured in the film, including X-Men, Blade, Daredevil/Elektra, and more\n\nJust as the movie itself was a tribute to many of these characters -- particularly Elektra and Blade -- this closing montage was a tribute and a farewell to characters and franchises who were often beloved and never got their rightful goodbye. Until now!\n\nFitting with Deadpool's trickster nature, the second credits scene turns out to be... mostly a joke.\n\nDeadpool is sick of people saying he got Johnny Storm (a surprise Chris Evans appearance) killed by telling Cassandra Nova (a great villain, we should add) the hyperbolic things he said. This was perhaps made worse by the fact that Cassandra gave Johnny what is pretty easily the most gruesome death in the history of the franchise, zapping his skin off of his bones and leaving him to turn into a pile of blood, muscle, and guts goo.\n\nBut, as we see in TVA footage, it turns out Deadpool was not lying or exaggerating with anything Johnny said about Cassandra at all. And as it turns out, he said even more! And then at the end of his rant, said \"...and you can quote me!\"\n\nSo, in the end, there's only one thing left to say: Deadpool innocent.", "source": {"uri": "menshealth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fourth wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elektra Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Character arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Green Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Riddance_(Time_of_Your_Life)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daredevil_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daredevil (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mcddean-wd073-66a00567cc7ad.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0721xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

In fact, a great many of the best Deadpool and Wolverine cameos are love letters to the days before the MCU ruled the world, harkening back to the first era of Marvel movies and the Fox glory days. While these appearances are ultimately intended to delight an audience that understands the history behind the various references, they also give the stars of forgotten or maligned movies a chance to take another bow, as was the case with one of the big cameos.\n\nAlthough it was anticipated as the next step in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's evolution, Deadpool and Wolverine is really more of a loving tour through the uneven history of the Marvel movies that Fox Studios made before Disney acquired the company in 2019. One of those stops brings back an actress who appeared in two largely maligned '00s superhero flicks.\n\nAttention readers: This story spoils a cameo and some plot details from Deadpool and Wolverine, so maybe don't read it if you haven't seen the movie and care about those kinds of things.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine has the two title characters (played by Ryan Reynolds and a returning Hugh Jackman) trying to stop the TVA, an organization that debuted in the Disney+ Loki series dedicated to \"pruning\" timelines, from destroying Deadpool's universe. In the process, they find themselves banished to the Void, a hodge-podge reality where anyone and everything that's been pruned ends up.\n\nThey meet characters from old Fox movies like X-Men villains Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and Pyro (Aaron Stanford), plus Chris Evans making an unexpected reprisal as his Fantastic Four character the Human Torch rather than Captain America. Following a fight, Deadpool and Wolverine find themselves in a hideout that some pruned heroes call home - the first of which is none other than Elektra, played for the first time in nearly 20 years by Jennifer Garner.\n\nElektra Natchios made her comics debut in 1981's Daredevil #168. A love interest to the blind crimefighter who has been a villain, antihero, and straightforward hero herself, Elektra is a highly trained Greek assassin. Her weapons of choice? A pair of sais.\n\nGarner, star of the TV show Alias and films like 13 Going on 30 and Juno, first played Elektra in the 2003 movie Daredevil, where she starred opposite her future husband Ben Affleck. (Garner and Affleck later divorced, which is likely why Elektra tells Deadpool not to be upset that Daredevil died in the Void in one of Deadpool and Wolverine's funniest meta jokes.) Garner also starred in the 2005 spin-off Elektra.\n\nThe early- and mid-'00s were an interesting time for superhero movies, as while there were classics like the Sam Raimi Spider-Man films and the early X-Men movies, there were also a lot of movies that aren't remembered fondly -- in part because the were overshadowed by the launch of the MCU and Christopher Nolan's Batman films a few years later.\n\nDaredevil and Elektra aren't especially beloved superhero movies. The first film did pretty well at the box office, but Elektra was a critical and commercial flop - though it's notable for being one of the first female-led superhero movies. Garner's performance as Elektra was generally well-regarded, though if it weren't for Deadpool and Wolverine, odds were that she'd never don a superhero costume again.\n\nAlthough she came back to reprise the role, Garner will almost certainly not be playing Elektra again in the MCU. A new version of the character, played by \u00c9lodie Yung, appeared in Season 2 of Netflix's Charlie Cox-led Daredevil TV show back in 2016. An upcoming new series, Daredevil: Born Again will make Cox's title character a proper part of MCU canon, though at this point it's unclear if Elektra will appear in the series (or if Yung would reprise her role.) In any case, it feels safe to assume that Deadpool and Wolverine was Garner's final time wielding the sais.", "source": {"uri": "gamesradar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gamesradar"}, "authors":

Why Trust Us?\n\nANYONE WHO READ Deadpool's first appearance in 1991's New Mutants #98 would likely be utterly stunned by all the buzz surrounding's Disney's 2024 blockbuster Deadpool & Wolverine. Created by Rob Liefeld and introduced in an issue scripted by Fabian Nicieza, Deadpool was a not-so-subtle riff on Deathstroke the Terminator from DC Comics, right down to borrowing the secret identity -- DC's Slade Wilson inspired the Marvel character's name, Wade Wilson. Deadpool looked cool, but had little attitude to distinguish him from any other tough-guy hired killer.\n\nFast-forward thirty years later, and Deadpool has become not just one of the most popular characters in comics fandom, but also one of the most popular superheroes, period. Ryan Reynolds has embodied the smart-mouth, fourth-wall-breaking antihero so successfully that Deadpool & Wolverine has become one of the most highly anticipated films of the year, one that Marvel is hoping will reverse the trend of superhero fatigue.\n\nBut Deadpool's journey from unremarkable supporting character to pop culture's most self-aware stinker since Bugs Bunny didn't first happen on the screen. It happened in the comics, where writers such as Joe Kelly, Christopher Priest, and Gail Simone made Wade so much more than a dull, derivative killer.\n\nAnyone interested in seeing how Deadpool became the Merc with a Mouth, or want a few great Wolverine stories, would do well to check out these comics.", "source": {"uri": "menshealth.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Health"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Nicieza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fabian Nicieza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Liefeld", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Liefeld"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Walt Disney Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wade_Wilson_(film_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wade Wilson (film character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secret identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terminator (character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(comics_writer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (comics writer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gail_Simone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gail Simone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supporting_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supporting character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bugs Bunny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Priest_(novelist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Priest (novelist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antihero"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/deadpool-and-wolverine-66a268f4b74de.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.331xh;0,0.189xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Iconic runs like \"Origin\" and \"Old Man Logan\" delve deep into Wolverine's origins and dark future, enriching his character. Uncanny X-Force presents a darker, team-oriented side of Wolverine, highlighting his brutal nature in a mature and tense setting.\n\nThere's a reason that Wolverine is the best there is at what he does. This famed Mutant has been a popular Marvel character for over 50 years thanks to his costume, powers, and rugged attitude. If fans of the character want to delve deep into the stories of Wolverine, then look no further than the best Wolverine comics that feature the Marvel character himself stealing the show across various runs and solo series.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best Superhero Theme Songs\n\nA superhero needs an iconic theme just as much as they need a memorable outfit, and these songs certainly do their heroes justice.\n\nWolverine has been in many comics over the years, and whilst there's a stellar list of one-shots and cameos, comic runs that feature Wolverine in his prime are the focus. The best Wolverine comic runs provide insight into his past, his actions, and what makes this iconic character tick.\n\n8 Wolverine (1982)\n\nWolverine's Ties To Japan Are Further Explored\n\nCreated by: Chris Claremont, Frank Miller\n\nWolverine's first major solo adventure came from the iconic creators Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Whilst the comic was only four issues, it's definitely memorable. Wolverine's adventure takes him to Japan, where he tries to regain the honor that he once lost and take the hand of his beloved Mariko. Wolverine's mission in Japan showcases the heart of the character and his complex past.\n\nThis mini-series is a perfect start for those who love Wolverine. It was at a point in time when Wolverine wasn't at the height of popularity, and the groundwork laid for his prominence and tragic past would forever show an entwining behavior for Wolverine's humanity and animalistic barbarity.\n\n7 Wolverine: The Dying Game (1994-1996)\n\nWolverine Lacks His Adamantium Skeleton, Which Makes Him A Feral Beast\n\nCreated by: Larry Hama, Adam Kubert\n\nAfter losing his Adamantium skeleton, Wolverine must discover a new life, one where the beast within is unleashed and unchecked thanks to his improving healing factor. Wolverine's struggles are at the precipice, and he might not come out as a human, especially when his team-ups with Ghost Rider, Deadpool, and Gambit lead to some heroic and bloody clashes.\n\nWolverine: The Dying Game is one of the perfect expressions of the 90s, and it can be a tad edgy, weird, and pretty awesome. For readers most curious about a Wolverine without the metal skeleton and claws that define him, then this is the run for them.\n\n6 Wolverine: Origin (2001-2002)\n\nThe Origins Of The Wolverine Unveiled\n\nCreated by: Bill Jemas, Andy Kubert\n\nWhilst most fans of the Marvel movies know of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine's past, there was a time when the character was shrouded in mystery, and his origins past savagery, and torment were unknown. Wolverine: Origin reveals the childhood of James Howlett, providing an intriguing insight into who he was before the Weapon X program, and the troubles he faced along the way.\n\nRelated\n\n6 Most Polarizing Marvel Movies You Either Love Or Hate\n\nNot every Marvel movie can be a smashing success, and some of them have entered a realm of infinite discourse among fans.\n\nWolverine: Origin is a great story and one of Wolverine's best for Marvel. The successful attempt to give Wolverine a history and a childhood is fantastic and delves deep into the origins of an amazing character. Wolverine's backstory is fleshed out with intensity and tragedy.\n\n5 Uncanny X-Force (2010-2012)\n\nWolverine Leads A Black Ops Team Of Mutants\n\nCreated by: Rick Remender, Jerome Opena\n\nThe X-Force does what the X-Men can't. Constant clashes with Cyclops and the X-Men provide an excuse to go down a darker path, and the X-Force will do the uncanny, committing themselves to black ops missions for the betterment of humanity and Mutants. This team-up comic has Wolverine at the front and center, alongside Archangel, Deadpool, Psylocke, and Fantomex.\n\nUncanny X-Force is a mature look into the darker side of the Mutant family, and Wolverine is the show-stealer, showcasing a brutal and unforgiving nature for a better world. There is so much tension and drama between the team members that Uncanny X-Force is an essential read for those seeking a more team-orientated Wolverine run.\n\n4 Wolverine: Old Man Logan (2008-2009)\n\nA Dark Future Where Heroes Are All Dead\n\nCreated by: Mark Millar, Steve McNiven, Dexter Vines\n\nA dark future awaits, and when evil engulfs all the good in the world, a wasteland is what remains. Wolverine remains a survivor. Tired, tragic, and drowning in his past misdeeds, Logan has been on a path to peace for over fifty years. Logan tries to be a good man in a new life with his family, but as this life is threatened, he must confront his past to secure his future.\n\nRelated\n\nFortnite: Best Marvel Skins\n\nMarvel has plenty of skins in Fortnite, ranging from comic appearances to the MCU, and here are some fan favorites.\n\nOld Man Logan has quickly become iconic and was one of the keen inspirations for Hugh Jackman's curtain call on the character in live-action. The book itself is masterfully done in terms of art and story. It's bleak, violent, and rather touching for a story on Wolverine's dark future.\n\n3 Wolverine: Enemy of the State (2004-2005)\n\nWolverine Fights The Marvel Universe\n\nCreated by: Mark Millar, John Romita Jr., Kaare Andrews\n\nCollecting the early issues of Wolverine's 2003 run, Enemy of the State showcases Wolverine at his most vulnerable and deadly. Wolverine has been subdued and brainwashed by Hydra and the Hand, and as an agent for their ruthless order, he will fight and slice through famed Marvel teams like the X-Men and Fantastic Four. The intensity of this Wolverine cannot be denied, but can he be saved before death and destruction takes hold?\n\nWolverine taking on S.H.I.E.L.D. is certainly cool enough, and as dual protagonists, Wolverine and Elektra are stellar in this bloody comic. This comic in particular focuses on Wolverine's potential as a killer, the bloody death toll he can leave behind, and what weight that holds on such a killer.\n\n2 Death of Wolverine (2014)\n\nAn Emotional Goodbye To The X-Man\n\nCreated by: Charles Soule, Steve McNiven\n\nLosing the edge of his healing factor, Wolverine must face death with his claws and reflexes.

Turnout this strong for \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" could also destroy doubts over the viability of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Disney's over-reliance on franchise fare in recent years, following multiple pricey tentpoles that underperformed in 2023.\n\nHowever, treating \"Deadpool\" as wholly representative of the MCU would ignore why it stands out in the first place.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" is Disney's first R-rated foray at the $200 million production mark, as well as the first R-rated MCU production for either Disney or Sony. Within the last decade, the only R-rated films to come from Marvel at all were the two prior \"Deadpool\" entries and 2017's \"Logan\" at 20th Century Fox.\n\nIt would have always been risky to downgrade the new film's subject matter to PG-13 levels; after all, Disney CEO Bob Iger was open to keeping its R rating back when the acquisition of Fox's assets was in the works.\n\nLikewise, the Disney-Fox deal has already reintroduced R-rated fare after Disney shuttered its Touchstone label in response to ending its deal with DreamWorks in 2015. Anyone who saw 2022's \"Barbarian,\" Oscar winner \"Poor Things\" or this year's \"The First Omen\" can attest that highly graphic films do exist in Disney's theatrical ecosystem.\n\nBut after the billion-dollar success of Warner Bros.' DC film \"Joker\" in 2019, it was obvious Disney would have to whip out Marvel's obvious R-rated equivalent again.\n\nDisney was ultimately smart not to rush \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" -- or any theatrical iteration of \"X-Men\" -- once it gained control of the IP, a move undoubtedly influenced by underwhelming performances for inherited post-acquisition films \"Dark Phoenix\" and \"The New Mutants\" in the \"X-Men\" franchise, the latter of which was a pandemic victim in 2020.\n\nAs a result, six years passed between \"Deadpool 2\" and its follow-up, allowing more time for star Ryan Reynolds and his creative team to flesh out ideas for the sequel and add an additional voice in writer, director and now frequent Reynolds collaborator Shawn Levy. \"Free Guy,\" Levy's last theatrical outing, starred Reynolds and was a modest hit for Disney in 2021.\n\nAs \"Inside Out 2\" just proved, time ought to be the secret sauce for Disney tentpoles going forward, a lesson that should have already been evident with \"Avatar: The Way of Water.\" While not as long as the decade-plus that passed between \"Avatar\" films, \"Inside Out 2\" released nine years after the first one, an example of Pixar's extensively planned production processes that stem from the sheer resources needed to animate these films from scratch and make them look their best.\n\nThe record-breaking release of \"Inside Out 2\" has largely defeated doubts over Pixar's future after \"Toy Story\" prequel \"Lightyear\" failed to launch in 2022 and new IP \"Elemental\" took a while to find its audience last year.\n\nTo be fair, the latter did end up earning more than twice as much as \"Lightyear\" globally, topping out close to $500 million, an outcome that helped break families' Disney+ dependency films like \"Soul,\" \"Luca\" and \"Turning Red\" contributed to when they skipped theaters to debut on the platform.\n\nBy contrast, the MCU has suffered heavily from workplace complaints across its various full-time and contracted VFX teams, culminating in the former's decision to unionize last year. After \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\" underperformed earlier in 2023, Disney fired Marvel VFX and post-production head Victoria Alonso, though the company cited a breach of contract for her role in producing an Amazon film as the cause.\n\nHowever, Marvel's TV strategy was later overhauled to focus on prioritizing shows that could potentially run for multiple and longer seasons, as opposed to the string of short miniseries that comprised its initial strategy. Revived from its Netflix run, a new \"Daredevil\" series, which had already begun shooting before the strikes and is now slated for 2025, will kick off the new effort, as its head writers and directors were replaced.\n\nNot long after that TV shake-up, \"The Marvels\" hit theaters and instantly became the worst-grossing film of MCU history, heightening the need for changes at Marvel. What could have simply been a direct sequel to 2019's highly successful \"Captain Marvel\" was instead expanded to continue the story arcs of characters introduced in Disney+ series \"WandaVision\" and \"Ms. Marvel,\" an example of how awry the MCU's dependence on interconnected storylines had grown in the wake of its \"Avengers\" mashups.\n\n\"Deadpool & Wolverine\" may foster some MCU continuity, but its barrier to entry is nothing more than having basic familiarity with the titular \"X-Men\" characters. Likewise, Disney's strike-related decision to push several upcoming MCU debuts and a \"Captain America\" sequel to 2025 makes the new \"Deadpool\" the lone Marvel film on its 2024 slate -- one that's been in demand for quite some time.\n\nIf the enduring popularity of Amazon series \"The Boys\" is any indication, the appetite for satirical -- and bloody -- superhero fare is as strong as ever.",

Promising intense action, heartfelt moments, and plenty of cheeky cameos, the film releases in theaters on July 26, 2024.\n\nReynolds, Jackman, director Shawn Levy, and co-stars Mathew Macfadyen, Emma Corrin, Rob Delaney, and producer Kevin Feige sit down with RT's Jacqueline Coley to talk about the film, discussing how they learned their intense dance numbers, balanced action and comedy, executed fight scenes, and much more.\n\nJaqueline Coley for Rotten Tomatoes: Both of you have been playing these characters so well for so long, but I loved in this when you also show the not-so-super superhero side. Both of your characters are kind of up against the ropes. Was that the most refreshing part about coming back to this one, the fact that you get to show \"you\" a little bit?\n\nRyan Reynolds: I think it's easy to give in to your more base instincts and, when we were writing the script, to lean on the R rating and that kind of exploitive sort of thing. I was really proud of ourselves to not... We certainly use, I think, the R rating and the freedom it allows effectively, but the thing we really exploited was the vulnerability of these guys.

They've teased a Deadpool controller and Xbox Series X that nobody can actually buy. Adding insult to injury, they've launched a fantastic Deadpool Cable Guy exclusive to the Microsoft Store, but you can't just buy it on its own. No, you have to shell out $130 for an Elite Series 2 Core controller. Seriously? But hold on, you don't have to spend $130. There's already Deadpool gaming merch out there that won't cost you a week's groceries! Yes, you can pick up a Deadpool Cable Guy for just $25 on Amazon. Be gone, Microsoft, you foul temptress!\n\nThere's no doubt about it: the Deadpool controller holder that comes free with the purchase of an Elite Series 2 Core controller is really, really nice. But it does require a spend of $130 to get your hands on. If you were going to buy one, a lovely extra. If you don't want to splash out on a new controller though, you're fresh out of luck -- and after the cruel tease of the Deadpool and Wolverine booty controllers that we can't buy, we are salty. Xbox marketing is infuriating right now. But you can show your frustration by choosing to spend your money elsewhere. These cute Deadpool Cable Guys are available to buy separately if you're not fussy about the design and just want some Deadpool merchandise to celebrate the launch of Deadpool and Wolverine.\n\nWhat's more, if you buy one of the $25 Cable Guys from Amazon and later decide you want an Elite Series 2 Controller, they are cheaper elsewhere. For example, right now, you can grab the Red at Target for $95.99. So is the Deadpool Cable Guy really free Microsoft?

The new Wolverine solo series will brings the hero's story full circle with the reintroduction of an \" all new \" Wendigo, as part of the ongoing celebration of Wolverine's 50th anniversary. The updated version of Wendigo in Wolverine #2 has the potential to further elevate the monster as a significant, terrifying threat to the Marvel Universe.\n\nMarvel's upcoming Wolverine solo series is set to feature the return of the first antagonist the X-Men hero ever faced off with: the Wendigo. The second issue of the series will force Logan into a confrontation with an \"all new\" take on the infamous legendary creature, as it seeks to take a pound of flesh from Wolverine once more.\n\nThe advanced solicitation for Wolverine #2 revealed the Wendigo's reemergence as a major threat to Wolverine, with Mart\u00edn C\u00f3ccolo's cover for the issue offering a faint glimpse of the brutal battle that is set to commence within its pages.\n\nWolverine #2 (2024)\n\nRelease Date:\n\nOctober 16, 2024\n\nWriter:\n\nSaladin Ahmed\n\nArtist:\n\nMart\u00edn C\u00f3ccolo\n\nCover Artist:\n\nMart\u00edn C\u00f3ccolo\n\nVariant Covers:\n\nRog\u00ea Ant\u00f4nio (Godzilla variant); More TBA\n\nWhere goes the Wendigo?!

Rather than a single superpowered individual, the Wendigo is a curse which passes between characters - suggesting that the latest incarnation of the villain, set to play a major role in Wolverine #2, is likely to come with an entirely updated origin story, in addition to a new look and a mysterious purpose.\n\nAccording to the synopsis for Wolverine #2, \"the secret [the Wendigo] hides will shape Wolverine's mission,\" emphasizing that this is more than just a throwaway encounter between the iconic X-hero and his first-ever opponent. Whatever the precise nature of the Wendigo's role in Wolverine #2, it will make a significant impact, one that can be expected to shape of the trajectory of the series moving forward. This is especially fitting, given that the story is part of Marvel's extended celebration of Wolverine's 50th year in comics.\n\nBattling The Wendigo Brings Wolverine's Story Full-Circle In New Series Wolverine #2 - Written By Saladin Ahmed; Art By Mart\u00edn C\u00f3ccolo Close\n\nThough the [Wendigo's] appearance in Wolverine #2 is first and foremost a tribute to the long history of both characters, it also signals a potentially exciting future for the character.\n\nUsing the Wendigo as an antagonist in the upcoming Wolverine series is an effective way to evoke the hero's history. At the same time, the updated version of Wendigo teased by Marvel's synopsis for Wolverine #2 suggests that writer Saladin Ahmed and artist Mart\u00edn C\u00f3ccolo have devised a unique spin on the Marvel monster, one that will elevate it further as a terrifying threat - and one that could perhaps be a sustained menace to Logan and his heroic allies moving forward.\n\nWith its Blood Hunt crossover event, and the upcoming Conquest 2099 series, Marvel has emphasized its commitment to its horror characters and concepts, of which Wendigo is an underrated, potent example. Though the monster's appearance in Wolverine #2 is first and foremost a tribute to the long history of both characters, it also signals a potentially exciting future for the character. In truth, any enemy that can go toe-to-toe with Wolverine deserves more opportunities to terrorize the Marvel Universe at large.\n\nWolverine #2 will be released on October 16, 2024 from Marvel Comics.\n\nWolverine\n\nThe human mutant Wolverine (a.k.a.

Deadpool & Wolverine is much more than just a romp through the multiverse: it also has the daunting task of capping off Fox's entire X-Men universe. Plus, with Marvel's biggest (and most nebulous) crossover, Avengers: Secret Wars, on the horizon, the saga has to start building out its new phase in earnest, too\n\nObviously Deadpool & Wolverine can't do all the heavy lifting, but it's still a foundational block in the MCU's Multiverse Saga (and it takes that role semi-seriously). The Shawn Levy film takes advantage of its unique position by bringing back Fox's most infamous legacy characters, dozens of Wolverine variants, and a deep-cut villain from the X-Men comics. It also slightly retcons the OG Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) role in the 20th Century Fox movies, beefing up his importance in relation to that universe by introducing a very intruiging new term to MCU canon: \"Anchor beings.\"\n\nBelow, we break down Deadpool & Wolverine's new multiverse twist, and how exactly it fits into Kevin Feige's plans for the MCU.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine takes us back to the Time Variance Authority, where our Merc with a Mouth gets a crash course on the multiverse. We've seen Deadpool traverse through parallel universes before -- but that was for comic relief. Now Mr. Paradox (Matthew Macfadyen) needs his help, and in order to do that, he has to learn about a little thing called an \"anchor being.\"\n\nAccording to Paradox, each universe is tethered to the life of one person. When that person dies, their host universe begins a process of \"degradation.\" It's essentially a slow death, one that the TVA used to accelerate by pruning entire timelines.\n\nThe Fox universe -- which hosts the X-Men, Deadpool, and a handful of other heroes -- is one such timeline. Its anchor being is Wolverine, and when he dies in Logan, that triggers degradation.\n\nIf this concept sounds familiar, that's because it shares some parallels with the \"singularities\" from the comics. Singularities play a big role in Jonathan Hickman's Secret Wars, with one in particular, Molecule Man, acting as a catalyst for the entire event. Molecule Man is the rare being that exists in every universe. When he dies in one, that timeline is effectively destroyed. He's able to trigger incursions (the collision of two universes) and even, with some assistance, clone himself to create new universes. Molecule Man is pretty crucial to the events of Secret Wars, but he's also a tricky character to adapt outside of the comics. With Deadpool & Wolverine and the introduction of anchor beings, could the MCU be avoiding singularities altogether?\n\nAccording to Kevin Feige, the answer isn't all that simple.\n\n\"I do think in the Marvel comics and in the MCU, there are beings of great importance,\" Feige tells Inverse. \"There are nexus beings that have been discussed, and in comic books there are omega-level mutants that have been discussed.\"\n\nFeige suggests that each of these terms -- along with anchor beings -- could all just be a different way of referring to the same thing.\n\n\"I think a lot of that, it depends on where you are within the universe of what terminology you use,\" Feige continues. \"The TVA uses the terminology of 'anchor beings' and 'a being of great importance.' Is that different than those other beings I've mentioned, or is it just a different terminology for the same thing? Remains to be seen.\"\n\nWith Marvel now gearing up for Secret Wars, we could get an answer to that question sooner than later. Hickman's take on Secret Wars dealt primarily with incursions, and incursions have already played a minor role in the Multiverse Saga. Whether they'll depend on anchor beings like Wolverine, nexus beings like the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), or singularities alone remains to be seen. The nature of Marvel's multiverse is still a total mystery, but it's clear that Deadpool & Wolverine is just one piece of the puzzle.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lyvie_scott@inverse.com", "name": "Lyvie Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecule_Man_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Molecule Man (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Levy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Levy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroactive_continuity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retroactive continuity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teams_and_organizations_of_the_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teams and organizations of the Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parallel universes in fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Macfadyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Macfadyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanda_Maximoff_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiverse (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Hickman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Hickman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Olsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Olsen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Publications/Comics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/23/c30cc14c/tdw-08486_r2.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Instead of the usual scenes of characters from the movie, or even some joke at the MCU post-credits scene gimmick's expense, the mid-credits sequence here begins a close-up of the doors to Patrick Stewart's Cerebro room opening.\n\nThen we see behind-the-scenes footage of the various 20th Century Fox superhero movies, much of it for the first time, inter-cut with scenes from the films. There's Hugh Jackman back in 2000, talking about his first day on set as Wolverine. There's Chris Evans and Jessica Alba, cracking wise while shooting the climax to Fantastic Four from 2005. There's Jennifer Garner practicing her ninja moves with sais as Elektra before the image fades into shots of the Thing from 2005 and 2015. We see Halle Berry and Jennifer Lawrence break character while filming their scenes on-set. And finally, there's Ryan Reynolds doing a B-roll interview on the set of X-Men Origins: Wolverine, talking about the connection he feels to Deadpool. It's a character he says means a lot to him.\n\nThis montage is accompanied by \"The Time of Your Life\" by Green Day, the ultimate high school graduation song. Between its whole-hearted, acoustic nostalgia and cheesy playfulness, the mid-credit sequence feels like a final goodbye to the Fox cinematic universe. Even if Deadpool & Wolverine leaves many of the characters still alive in their own universe, the credit sequence seems to close the book on the characters and the journey that began with X-Men in 2000.", "source": {"uri": "denofgeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Den of Geek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_george@denofgeek.com", "name": "Joe George", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-up", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Close-up"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Stewart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Stewart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-credits_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post-credits scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektra_Records", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elektra Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans_(actor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Evans (actor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ninja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Alba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Alba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Garner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Garner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Day", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jennifer Lawrence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halle_Berry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Halle Berry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_Origins:_Wolverine_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine (video game)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Characters", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TVB2240_comp_WTA_v0029.1050_R.jpg?fit=1719%2C720", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

While it was released on Thursday, July 25 the cinema had special early previews at midnight, so I made sure to stay clear of spoilers on social media.\n\nAs a general film, I loved it. But, as a superhero fan, I was left slightly disappointed...\n\nNow, look. Deadpool stands out on its own, despite the superhero fatigue. The films never take themselves too seriously, and that's why they've proven to be such a hit. On the whole, it's a great addition to the franchise. But for me, it felt more like a standalone film as opposed to a committed sequel.\n\nSet six-years after the 2018 film, it starts with Wade Wilson living a normal civilian life, somewhat depressed, before realising that his universe is facing an existential threat and is slowly fading away. He has been given a new reason to live.\n\nHe teams up with Wolverine, recovering from his injuries in a parallel reality, to defeat a common enemy in a multiverse-hopping adventure.\n\nI'll admit, the violence and fight scenes felt repetitive, the problem with a third go-around. Especially because, well, they cannot be killed. While well-choreographed, the action was lacking in parts. I will say that the opening sequence was my favourite being completely fun and gruesome, but tragically setting the bar a little too high. But hey, clearly the leading pair were having a ball.\n\nI felt that the narrative was a little slow-paced to begin with. However, in true Deadpool-fashion, it was consistently and genuinely funny with its crude punchlines and for that reason alone I advise you go and watch it - especially if you enjoy the goofy side to Marvel. Which, let's face it, we all do.\n\nAs for the plot, it left me feeling 'meh' - underwhelmed with no real urgency and substance. After so much hype and anticipation, I was expecting to leave the cinema feeling truly wowed and impressed. It did, however, bring closure for the earlier Marvel eras which was satisfying to see.\n\nOn the other hand, the cheering moment cameos are brilliant - and that's coming from a non die-hard fan of the Marvel Universe. Director Shawn Levy was certainly not exaggerating when he said fans should expect \"a lot\" of them. For me, they were the highlight of the entire film.\n\nIt also had far more emotionally impactful moments than I had anticipated. And it's these sincere and heartfelt scenes that tie in beautifully with the comedy.\n\nSupervillain Emma Corrin was a delight to watch, although I wish her character had been developed even more to let the audience empathise with her throughout the film.\n\nReynolds and Jackman are nothing short of excellent, and their real-life friendship allows their characters to bounce off one another really well. I appreciated the multiple 'breaking the fourth wall' elements, with Reynolds cuing the montage and telling the camera to pan up for a cool shot.\n\nOverall, the film largely plays off.

Sorry not sorry for the non-spoiler there, but amid all the parade of cameos and surprises in the new film, and even the key role the X-Men villain plays in the plot, the ex-footballer turned actor is not a last-second addition to the cast. And no offense to Vinnie Jones, but it is 100% fine they got a new Juggernaut for the movie.\n\nAs mentioned, Jones portrayed the unstoppable mutant villain with a metal dome in the third live-action X-Men movie. While it was a critical, fan, and box office failure, Jones clearly became enamored with the character - he even wound up pushing for a Juggernaut spin-off movie. That's not entirely out of the realm of possibility given Fox at the time was also considering spinoffs for other relatively under-the-radar characters like Gambit. But also, other than Jones, it wasn't entirely clear who would want to see that film.\n\nCut to 2018, and Juggernaut made an appearance as a third-act villain in Deadpool 2. The new take on the character was specifically there because the creative team behind the sequel didn't think Juggernaut was done justice in his previous appearances - including Jones in X-Men 3.\n\n\"Ryan Reynolds is the voice of Juggernaut, believe it or not,\" co-writer Rhett Reese told IGN at the time. \"Slightly modulated with a computer to bring his register down. But Juggernaut is such a force of nature, and he has not really been done justice in previous movies, because he wasn't ever a CG character. And so, we just thought he was probably the coolest character never to be used as of yet in the right way.\"\n\nNot only was Reynolds the voice of Juggernaut, director David Leitch was the body: his face and movements were used to create the CG model for the character.\n\nThen, when it came time to bring Juggernaut back (again) for Deadpool and Wolverine, the goal was clearly to go back to the X-Men: The Last Stand version. Spoilers for Deadpool and Wolverine past this point, but in the film, a ragtag team of heroes need to steal Juggernaut's helmet in order to shut down the mind-manipulating powers of main villain, Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). The Juggernaut who shows up looks like Jones, moves like Jones, and is dressed in the same helmet and barely-there costume Jones wore in The Last Stand. But it's not Jones.\n\nAccording to the actor, he's not in the movie because it was a chore to put on the suit, and they couldn't pay him enough money to convince him to slap it back on. He said as much in an interview with Yahoo UK, explaining why he wasn't going to be in the MCU film.\n\n\"I just got asked to do Deadpool, the new one now, and I spoke to the director [Shawn Levy] and I just said it's such a drama putting that suit on mentally and physically,\" Jones told the outlet. \"I mean it had its mental toll as well because you're in it and you can't do anything all day, you can only drink through a straw. So we couldn't strike the deal for Deadpool [and Wolverine]. But Deadpool's my favourite movie of all fucking time more or less. I really wanted to do it, but they didn't have the budget to put me in the suit.\"\n\nShould actors be paid what they're worth? Sure. Clearly Marvel ponied up enough money to bring back Ray Park as Toad, Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, and Kelly Hu as Lady Deathstrike for essentially nothing roles. So why not Jones?\n\n...Because it also would have been okay if Park, Mane, and Hu didn't come back in their respective roles. Is it nice to see them? Yes. But unlike Aaron Stanford's Pyro, who has an actual role in the movie, none of the other Deadpool and Wolverine cameos impact the plot of the movie in any way. Juggernaut is definitely the most crucial to the plot when it comes to the ex-X-Men characters, but, as it stands, Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds) makes a quip about a third Juggernaut actor, and we all move on with our lives.\n\nBeyond that, no shade to Jones, but what is the only thing you can remember about his performance from X-Men: The Last Stand? It's a safe bet your clearest memory is Juggernaut uncomfortably repeating a viral internet meme: \"I'm the Juggernaut, bitch!\" Would watching his ankles get sliced by X-23 (Dafne Keen) really bring viewers the #JusticeForJuggernaut they've so desperately craved since 2006? Probably not.\n\nSo ultimately, despite Juggernaut's prominence in the plot, it wasn't worth the money to bring Jones back. And frankly, given all the pain it seems to cause him to put on the suit, it doesn't seem to be worth his time, either. But hey, as comic book fans know well, nobody stops the Juggernaut. Maybe with the success of Deadpool and Wolverine, he'll get a shot at that Juggernaut solo film after all. Or, if not, they can just bring in a fourth actor.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine is in UK cinemas now and hits US theaters on July 26.

I always knew they were going to find me out and he found me out and this kid yelled to his mom 'mom, this clown is crap'. And I'm like 'shut up, kid'...\"\n\nRyan reveals original opening for Deadpool & Wolverine:\n\n\"I'm shocked that we managed to get through this without some of our biggest surprises, even hypothesized online...the original idea with this movie was to shoot a fake movie called Alpha Cop, that was intentionally bad...It was about two guys that were sharing one brain and together they make the perfect cop...and the poster says Alpha Cop: two cops, one brain, all balls. And it was meant to be kind of like horrible. Like 10 people in America would go to see this movie on opening weekend and five minutes into the movie the Marvel logo would flip up and it would actually be Deadpool & Wolverine...\"\n\nHugh on X-Men Origins: Wolverine leak:\n\n\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine...it was leaked maybe a week before we came out, and I think I just remember someone saying and I think it's up to 10 million people had seen it before it came out. That's a bad leak.\"\n\nRyan, on importance of character vs. spectacles in films to resonate with the audience:\n\nRR: \"Some films that I've been on, they have a lot of money and you kind of keep throwing more money at a problem, when your real problem is that you're focused on spectacle over character...and when you focus on spectacles as much as character, the audiences I think are a little unnerved to spectacle.

While Green Day's \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" is playing, the footage shows all these outtakes and behind the scene footage from X-Men, Wolverine, Fantastic Four (both casts), X-Men Origin, and more. The montage ends with the 20th Century Fox logo.\n\nThe post-credits scene shows Deadpool back at the TVA talking to the audience.

As everyone was eager to decode the characters and plot from the short trailer, the makers had a candid chat about why they want everyone to watch this film in theaters.\n\nIn a recent press meeting, where Kevin Feige, Marvel Studios president; actor Ryan Reynolds; actor Hugh Jackman; and director Shawn Levy were present, they addressed the importance of watching 'Deadpool & Wolverine' in theaters.\n\nRyan remarked, \"Collective effervescence is basically when you experience a kind of elation that can only happen in a group or a shared experience. Movie theaters, since I was as small as I can remember, have been a temple of collective effervescence. So, seeing a movie, especially one like this that is quite literally built as a fastball of joy, designed for audience delight, where its sole purpose for being written, produced, and created was joy.\"\n\nOn a lighter note, Ryan further added, \"Disney may say it's about money or capitalism. But really, genuinely, from our perspective, everyone sitting right here, it's joy. And that joy is best experienced on the bigger the screen, the better.\" Director Shawn agreed with the actor and called it a great answer.\n\nAt the same time, Ryan's co-star Hugh Jackman mentioned his wish to add a bit more to his answer: \"I'd like to add a little. I think also, the movie is funny, it's action-packed, it's massive -- it's all those things you want. But it's also about friendship, and I think going to a cinema, whether with a friend or someone close to you, is going to be an experience you'll want to enjoy with others.\"\n\nHugh concluded, \"And as you said, in a temple or whatever that is, a modern-day temple. Going to a cinema, I think, with friends or people close to you, is going to make this experience the best.\"\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine - Official Trailer\n\nIn this movie, Ryan Reynolds stars as Wade Wilson, also known as Deadpool, a wisecracking mercenary with a sharp sense of humor and a heart of gold. After undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation to treat terminal cancer, Wade gains accelerated healing abilities but is left with severe scarring all over his body.\n\nHugh Jackman reprises his iconic role as James \"Logan\" Howlett, also known as Wolverine. A former member of the X-Men, Logan is a mutant with extraordinary healing abilities, retractable claws, and a skeleton infused with indestructible adamantium.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Like \"Captain America: Civil War,\" the latest \"Deadpool\" does an epic crossover that brings multiple heroes together, but this time on a much larger scale. Undoubtedly, this is kind of the \"Deadpool\" equivalent of \"Avengers: Endgame,\" but for the entire history of Marvel movies made by 20th Century Fox, as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The result is polarizing, but for many, it will work like catnip.\n\nThis is honestly a perfect send-off to more than 25 years of superhero movies before and even after the MCU changed cinema, an homage to the movies that built the superhero landscape as we know it, to the movies that maybe weren't as influential or successful, and also perhaps the movies that never got made. Beyond the gnarly, gross violence and the crude jokes, the \"Deadpool\" movies have always been earnest, but this is probably the most effective one of the trilogy when it comes to an emotional throughline -- and it is its most meta yet.\n\nOf course, this is still a \"Deadpool\" movie, one that pokes fun at everyone and everything -- from joking about an X-rated sex act that Kevin Feige had to teach some Marvel employees about, to jokes about the MCU's own failings to joking about its competition, DC Studios. There are a handful of jokes about DC comics, including one spectacular and unexpected cameo that proves DC wasted one of its stars -- Henry Cavill. Indeed, Cavill shows up as a rather screen-ready and perfectly cast Logan, known as Cavillrine in the credits.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rafael_motamayor@slashfilm.com", "name": "Rafael Motamayor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_Civil_War_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain America: Civil War (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossover (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epic film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameo appearance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avengers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Studios", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "20th Century Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superhero film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Feige"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cavill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Quotations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/deadpool-wolverines-most-unexpected-cameo-proves-that-one-actor-was-always-in-the-wrong-comic-book-universe/l-intro-1721868064.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Well, the character has garnered intense speculation ever since its appearance in the trailer of Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman-led MCU film. The fan theories have been wild, some even speculating Taylor Swift's cameo as either Ladypool or Dazzler, a musician superhero mutant. And when Gigi Hadid appeared during the 'Deadpool & Wolverine' premiere alongside Blake Lively recently, internet sleuths did not spare to add the supermodel's name to join the bandwagon in their speculative theories.\n\nUnfortunately, to burst the bubble, you won't see any of them in the film because the cameos don't exist. Sorry, fans you've been led astray by the online chatter and a well-plotted scheme by Marvel. The superhero production house has already admitted to fake planting leaks to hide the biggest cameos of the latest MCU entry. But let us tell you Ladypool isn't one of them.\n\nFans expected the face of the much-hyped character to unveil in the movie but Marvel refrained from doing so. She appears leading an army of Deadpools, gets a dialogue or two in her due time, and disappears from the plot without much context. This indicates Ladypool wasn't a significant part of the film at all but Marvel led you to believe it to protect the real cameos. \"There may or may not have been some subterfuge and misdirections on the internet or in-person in order to protect the secrecy,\" Wendy Jacobson, an executive producer at Marvel, previously admitted in an interview with GamesRadar+.\n\nWhile the Ladypool angle will have you disappointed, elsewhere Marvel packs on interesting cameos from Chris Evans, Henry Cavill, and many more in 'Deadpool & Wolverine.'

The duo hops through different universes to save the day from the Time Variance Authority agent Mr. Paradox (Matthew McFayden).\n\nEdwards: \"It's like a two-hour-plus ... gag reel. The first Deadpool ... was snarky, and kind of cool in an R-rated way, and that was okay. The second time around, it all began to get a bit tiresome. Now it's all just completely exhausting. I mean, Ryan Reynolds is basically doing the same thing he's done his entire career. And it's time for him to move on. It's time for him to mature. I mean, the jokes aren't funny, it's all inside baseball. ... He breaks the fourth wall like every other second, so literally, he's not breaking the fourth wall anymore. ... It's tailor-made for Marvel fans or comic book geeks. But for anyone else ... you just won't get it. I mean, this film ... left me with a headache. And I just I was begging for just somewhat of a plot, anything of a story. ... They just fight each other for no reason. Nobody wins, and they fight each other again, and they're jabbing and it's bloody. And there's more dumb jokes. And this thing is just stuck in spin cycle. ... I was completely frustrated.\"\n\nWalsh: \"You're either onboard and in the tank for Deadpool at this point, or this sounds like absolute hell to sit through. I am in the latter camp.\n\nI think it's a fascinating case study for Kevin Feige, the producer of all these Marvel films -- Marvel is owned by Disney, Disney absorbed 20th Century Fox. Both Deadpool and Wolverine were 20th Century Fox Marvel characters. So this is like a viking funeral for the 20th Century Fox era of Marvel movies, like they're bringing in all these old 20th Century Fox Marvel characters, and giving them a little follies tribute or something. So it's fascinating in this ... corporate media analysis way, on a meta level. ... Definitely you have to be up on your corporate mergers and acquisitions to get the full effect. But this movie is going to be massive. It's going to make so much money.\"\n\nDidi\n\nDirector Sean Wang's (Nai Nai and Wai Po) feature film debut follows a 13-year-old Taiwanese American boy as he navigates adolescence. It won the Audience Award at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nWalsh: \"This is such an amazing snapshot of coming-of-age in a very specific time and with very specific identity issues going on. ... Wai Po is in the movie as a character named Nai Nai actually, his grandmother does play the other grandmother. So it's very personal. He shot it in Fremont, where he's from. ... What Sean Wang does is he creates not just the physical landscape of this place, but also the cultural landscape and the digital landscape, the sonic visual time of Myspace top eight, and YouTube videos, and the music of this era, and AOL Instant Messenger.\n\n... This kid Chris ... he's navigating this really tricky period from middle school to high school, so it just takes place over a couple of months in the summertime. And it just follows his fumbling attempts at connection with a girl that he has a crush on and with his middle school friends. He ends up falling in with a group of skaters and trying to film stuff for them. And so he's really testing out his identity, and mediating a lot of his social relationships through his online presence. ... Ultimately ... we realize that family is everything, even though he's rejecting his family and trying to go out on his own. They are all that he has that is going to be consistent.\"\n\nEdwards: \"We've seen this type of coming-of-age story a million times, but somehow this one feels fresh. And it's not because of the obvious. It's because it just feels so totally authentic, just the language, their use of technology, their interaction, the settings. I also love it when filmmakers cast actual teenagers to play teenagers. ... So the casting was dead on, and the acting just felt so organic. ... There's a story here, and it tugs at your heart, and it tugs at your soul.... This captured the complexities of dealing with emotions that's every bit as effective and executed as well as Inside Out 2. There's an innocence to the film, there's a nostalgia to the film. But it all works so well because the attention to detail is so nailed down ... that you believe in every aspect of it.\"\n\nThe Fabulous Four\n\nThis raunchy comedy follows a group of life-long friends who travel to Key West to serve as bridesmaids in their college friend's wedding. It stars Bette Midler, Susan Sarandon, Sheryl Lee Ralph, and Megan Mullally.\n\nEdwards: \"My mother and aunt are going to love this movie. It's easily digestible. It's silly without being insulting.\n\n... But I just wish Hollywood would understand one thing: Older women of a certain age are the smartest and most interesting people on the planet. So I don't understand why they can't portray them that way. And they can still let them have their fun without being on the edge of being stupid. Because I mean, Bette Midler is a national treasure. Susan Sarandon, she's one of the most gifted actresses of all time. Sheryl Lee Ralph is a can-do-everything dynamo who's currently experiencing ... the resurgence of a lifetime. And they all want to work. But why not make it worth their while, and give them material that they truly deserve?\"\n\nWalsh: \"They get four women who are in their 60s or 70s, beloved stars, Oscar-winning actors. And then they send them on a destination. They pick one or two hot older actors. Here it is Bruce Greenwood and an Irish guy. ... And then they all have catharsis about their friendships. And there's long-held resentments, and they all come to the fore. And then of course, there's high jinks.\n\n... There is a central conflict where Bette Midler's character has betrayed Susan Sarandon's character. She has married her husband from a million years ago, that husband is now dead, and she's getting remarried. But there's this central betrayal. And Susan Sarandon, in the brief moments where she is allowed to convey the hurt ... of her character, is so good. ... And then it swerves into some wacky moment like a TikTok dance or a male stripper or a boat accident.\"\n\nMade In England: The Films of Powell and Pressburger\n\nThis documentary tracks the influence of two British cinema giants: Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. It is directed by David Hinton and narrated by Martin Scorsese.\n\nWalsh: \"I'm a huge fan of Powell and Pressburger, who are also known as The Archers, which is their production company. They made The Red Shoes ... The Life and Times Of Colonel Blimp, A Matter Of Life And Death. A lot of their films were rather fantastical, experimental, beautiful use of technicolor. For me as a film nerd listening to Scorsese talk about Powell and Pressburger for two hours, it's like a dream.\"\n\nEdwards: \"I could listen to Martin Scorsese talk all day, every day for the entire year. And he's so deeply connected to these filmmakers, and he's so passionate in it. He talks about the elements that influenced him, and he intercuts that with some of his own films that he directed. ... I love every single solitary second of this documentary.\"", "source": {"uri": "kcrw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KCRW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Logan earned the nickname \"Wolverine\" by outworking and outlasting others at an incredibly difficult job, impressing his coworkers and leading them to fondly bestow the nickname upon him. Despite his eventual hero status, Wolverine's name has a humble origin, though he would come to embody its more dangerous implications in time.\n\nEven most hardcore Marvel Comics fans aren't wrong for assuming Wolverine's name comes from the fact he has razor-sharp claws and his short stature, this actually isn't the case. In fact, Logan got his iconic superhero nickname long before his time with the X-Men and his role as one of Marvel's premiere heroes.\n\nWolverine: The Origin #5 - written by Paul Jenkins, with art by Bill Jemas - revealed the true backstory of the \"Wolverine\" moniker. After Wolverine was forced to flee the Howlett estate, due to being blamed for his father's murder, he ran away to a quarry, where he inadvertently gained one of comics' greatest codenames.\n\nWolverine spent years working in this quarry, enduring backbreaking labor every single day. Despite how hard this job was, Wolverine was capable of doing it faster and longer than anyone else there, which earned him both respect and an iconic nickname.\n\nIt wasn't Logan's claws that made him Wolverine ; instead, it was the fact that he was a great worker at a hard job, surrounded by people who respected him.\n\nRelated Wolverine's New Nickname Is the Perfect Reference to His Original Design\n\nMarvel christens Wolverine with a new nickname, simultaneously highlighting the one thing wrong with Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the iconic X-Man.\n\nLogan's Relentless Hard Work Earned Him Him The Nickname \"Wolverine\" Wolverine: The Origin #5 - Written By Paul Jenkins; Art By Bill Jemas, Joe Quesada, Andy Kubert, Richard Isanove, Wes Abbott, & Oscar Gongorra Close\n\nLogan proved to be incredibly dedicated to his work, and even more resilient, leading him to have the title \"Wolverine\" bestowed upon him by his coworkers at the quarry.\n\nWorking in a quarry is incredibly difficult. It involves breaking and moving stones nearly all day, and the workers here weren't treated exceptionally well, with only a few food rations to go around each day. Fights over not getting enough food weren't uncommon. Due to his mutant abilities, Wolverine was able to work far longer than any of the others, and he earned their respect for it. While it'd be easy to see others getting jealous, that wasn't the case. The other workers were surprisingly supportive, and aside from a few examples, they welcomed Wolverine and treated him like family.\n\nWolverine's mutant powers of enhanced strength and regeneration were the key to making him the incredibly effective quarry worker he was. Thanks to his enhanced strength, he was capable of moving far more stones than his small size would imply. His healing factor was also a major benefit, as unlike the other workers, Wolverine never got tired. He could lift as many stones and crush as many rocks as he needed, and after just an hour of rest, he'd be right back and ready to go again. Despite the major hero Wolverine would become, his name comes from a surprisingly simple origin.\n\nWolverine Found His Identity At The Quarry (& Briefly, True Community) The Iconic Superhero's Humble Origin\n\nLogan proved to be incredibly dedicated to his work, and even more resilient, leading him to have the title \"Wolverine\" bestowed upon him by his coworkers at the quarry. Before Wolverine was a world-saving hero, he was just a simple boy from Canada, and he didn't get his iconic name from being a mutant or a hero. It wasn't Logan's claws that made him Wolverine; instead, it was the fact that he was a great worker at a hard job, surrounded by people who respected him.\n\nWolverine: The Origin #5 is on sale now from Marvel Comics!\n\nWolverine\n\nThe human mutant Wolverine (a.k.a.

His diet and workout regime to achieve this sculpted physique is legendary and as the Australian actor edges towards 60, it's all the more impressive.\n\nRelated: Here are all the Deadpool & Wolverine spoilers\n\nJackman has been playing the jacked hero since 2000 when he was cast in the first X-Men movie so it's been almost a quarter century, with the release of Deadpool & Wolverine in 2024. Reprising the role has been no small feat for Hugh, who had to throw himself deep into training for months before filming began.\n\n\"It's been five years and I'd really never thought I'd come back and I'm really, really excited about it,\" Jackman told Men's Health in 2022 when it was first announced that he would be reprising the role. \"I'm going to have the time of my life... I can tell you that I started back at the gym and I'm eating a lot.\"\n\nHe later told People that, \"When I came back to it, it was really fun and I was thrilled. My body was a little sore at the beginning, but I was thrilled that my body was still responding. And I realized how good it is for your brain. But the hardest bit...the food,\" he admitted. \"I have to eat a lot. For me, for my body type, I'm naturally skinny. To get the size on, that's the hardest bit. That's the bit that does my head in.\"\n\nIn March 2023, Hugh gave us a glimpse of what bulking for Wolverine entails from a food perspective. \"Bulking. A day in the life,\" Jackman wrote in a caption of an Instagram post, which showed six meals a day. \"Thank you, Chef Mario, for helping me stay healthy and properly fed whilst... Becoming. Wolverine. Again.\"\n\nAccording to Variety, Hugh consumes black bass (2,000 calories), Patagonia salmon (2,100 calories), two chicken burgers (around 1,000 calories each), and two grass-fed sirloins (1,100 calories each). It equals around 8,000 calories of mostly protein to get into Wolverine shape -- to put that into perspective, the average man needs around 2,500.\n\nDuring an interview on HBO's Who's Talking to Chris Wallace, the host asked Hugh to comment on the speculation over the years that he'd taken steroids to bulk up. \"No, I love my job. And I love Wolverine,\" he replied.\n\n\"I got to be careful what I say here, but I had been told anecdotally what the side effects are of that. And I was like, 'I don't love it that much.' So no, I just did it the old-school way. And I tell you, I've eaten more chickens -- I'm so sorry to all the vegans and vegetarians and to the chickens of the world. Literally the karma is not good for me. If the deity has anything related to chickens, I'm in trouble.\"", "source": {"uri": "stylecaster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StyleCaster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sophie_hanson@stylecaster.com", "name": "Sophie Hanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hugh Jackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calorie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Calorie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superhero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men's_Health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Men's Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micropterus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micropterus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagonia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patagonia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HBO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamburger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hugh-jackman-1.png?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 95, "relevance": 1}

After the fall of Krakoa, Marvel is beginning its X-Men: From the Ashes era with a relaunch of the entire line of comics. One of those titles is a new Wolverine series from writer Saladin Ahmed and Marvel Stormbreakers artist Martin Coccolo. The book takes Wolverine back into the Canadian wilderness to reunite with his wolf pack, but of course, trouble will not be far behind. Wolverine will be accessible to old and new readers alike, and a preview of the first issue is a perfect example.\n\nComicBook has the exclusive first look at Wolverine #1 by Saladin Ahmed and Martin Coccolo. It begins with Logan living his best life, running shirtless through the Canadian snow with wolves. Of course, Wolverine and the wolves could be on the hunt for prey. The second preview page does show someone on the hunt, and it's the Wolverine adversary Cyber. He's got an oversized rifle in his arms, and most likely intends to use it on Wolverine. Cyber has a long history with Logan, and has arms covered in Adamantium skin.\n\nThe final two pages feature Nightcrawler, one of Wolverine's best friends on the X-Men. Nightcrawler comes across a group of murdered people in the woods, and then has to defend himself against a sneak attack by Logan. But Wolverine has Nightcrawler's scent, so it's only a matter of time before he tracks Kurt Wagner down.\n\nWolverine writer previews new X-Men: From the Ashes series\n\n\"We will be joining Logan in the aftermath of some globally dramatic events that have affected both mutantkind and humankind, and my man is, in a word, exhausted\" Salad Ahmed said in the X-Men: From the Ashes sampler. \"He's turned his back on the whole notion of organized society. But, of course, the world isn't done with him.\"\n\nAhmed then spoke about the inclusion of Nightcrawler in the series. \"I don't wanna spoil too much, but I love Kurt as a character and find him to be the perfect foil/complement to Wolverine,\" he said. \"Hopefully rather than cynical, swashbuckling rather than grisly, feelings on his sleeve instead of stoic - I love writing the two of them together, not only for the action and banter, but for the deeper conversation between the personalities.\"\n\nThe exclusive first look at Wolverine #1 is below. The issue goes on sale in September.\n\nPreview 1 Preview 2 Preview 3 Preview 4", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_The_Animated_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "X-Men: The Animated Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Ashes_(Dungeons_&_Dragons)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "From the Ashes (Dungeons & Dragons)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolverine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wolverine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladin_Ahmed", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saladin Ahmed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightcrawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nightcrawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krakoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Krakoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pack_(canine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pack (canine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ongoing_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ongoing series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wilderness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamantium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adamantium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutant (Marvel Comics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Wagner"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/07/25/b8a7bc8c-7447-4967-a2a3-4ff1349cd01b/wolverine-x-men-from-the-ashes-exclusive.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9762926", "eventUri": "eng-9762926", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 88, "relevance": 1}

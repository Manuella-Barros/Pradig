In the month's first eight days, UCF landed six of its 2024 signees -- including three of its four All-Americans: offensive lineman Waltclaire Flynn Jr., linebacker Qua Birdsong and tight end Kylan Fox. Not to mention, Dr. Phillips safety/linebacker Jashad Presley committed on the final day of June, and Benjamin offensive tackle Chase Malamala joined the class the following week.\n\nThey're in the game: UCF players share excitement, high expectations for EA Sports College Football 25\n\nWho's in? Who's gone? Analyzing UCF football's transfer portal additions, losses during spring window\n\nWill there be another bevy of booms on the horizon?\n\nHere is a position-by-position breakdown of UCF's recruiting targets, and where things stand following the flurry of visits.\n\nThe name to watch among UCF's quarterback targets is Malik Washington, an Elite 11 finalist hailing from Severn (Md.) Archbishop Spalding. Of the 20 competitors at this week's national showcase for signal-callers in Los Angeles, Washington is one of just two that are uncommitted -- along with Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele out of Hawaii.\n\nWashington (6-foot-5, 200 pounds) is a consensus four-star recruit, rated 14th among all 2025 quarterbacks by 247Sports. Named Player of the Year by the Capital Gazette in each of the last two seasons, Washington completed 62.3% of his passes (62.3%) for 2,093 yards with 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions, adding 204 yards and six scores on the ground.\n\n\"The last time (Malzahn) had a quarterback built like me, he went and won a national championship with Cam Newton,\" Washington said after his UCF visit. \"I think I fit (the offense) pretty well.\"\n\nHe visited UCF the weekend of May 31, and has also taken trips to Virginia Tech and Syracuse. Maryland will get Washington's last visit this coming weekend after the Elite 11 event, and both Tom Loy and Brian Dohn of 247Sports predict he will stay close to home and choose the Terrapins.\n\nUCF brought in a second Elite 11 finalist to kick off June in Macon (Miss.) Noxubee County's KaMario Taylor, who has been committed to Mississippi State since Oct. 13. Taylor accounted for more than 4,400 yards of total offense and 63 touchdowns during his junior campaign.\n\nKJ Jefferson will be a one-and-done player for UCF, but the Knights have long-term options waiting in the wings. Miami transfer Jacurri Brown still has three years of eligibility, while redshirt freshman Dylan Rizk and true freshmen Riley Trujillo and EJ Colson each have four.\n\nOsceola's Taevion Swint became the Knights' first commit more than 14 months ago -- announcing his pledge following the 2023 spring game. He took his lone official visit to date on May 31.\n\nSwint (5-10, 180) is a top-25 national player at the position, according to the four major recruiting services (247, On3, Rivals and ESPN), and a top-300 overall recruit. He has rushed for 2,880 yards and 38 touchdowns across three varsity seasons, though he was limited to six games last fall due to injury.\n\n\"I'm back and better,\" said Swint, a high school teammate of Knights defensive linemen John Walker and Derrick Leblanc. \"Last year was just a bump in the road. I've come back real strong and hard for the rest of the guys that were doubting me.\"\n\nHis spring game performance -- nearly 200 yards and three TDs against Edgewater and DeLand -- backed up that claim. Swint could well be the key piece of this recruiting class, and a focal point of Malzahn's run-heavy offense.\n\nUCF made a run at Plant's Waltez Clark, envisioning him in an all-purpose athlete role, but the Florida commit canceled a June 7-9 visit after he attended Bounce House Weekend in an unofficial capacity the weekend prior.\n\nFirst-year offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach Tim Harris Jr. is determined to bring in proven playmakers from championship-level programs, including last year's selection as Mr. Football throughout the state of Florida.\n\nCocoa's Jayvan Boggs (6-1, 190) will choose between UCF and Missouri on July 4, having canceled scheduled trips to USC and Georgia. Boggs reopened his recruitment in March after committing to Ohio State and landed verbal offers from a number of established bluebloods, including Texas and Oregon.\n\nBoggs, who caught 93 balls for 1,493 yards and 23 touchdowns for the Class 2S state champion Tigers, was among the last to leave Bounce House Weekend and has been a frequent UCF visitor over the last year.\n\nTampa Bay Tech's Santonyo Isaac (6-1, 170) verbally committed to the Knights on the afternoon of the Gasparilla Bowl in December and has built a strong connection with Harris since he rejoined the program from Miami. Isaac caught 30 passes for 695 yards and tied Oregon commit Dallas Wilson for the Titans' team lead in TD receptions (nine).\n\nSt. Augustine's Carl Jenkins Jr. (6-2, 177) listed UCF among his top four schools last week, along with Louisville, Mississippi State and South Florida. Fresh off a 60-catch, 1,172-yard and 15-touchdown season for the Class 3S runner-up Yellow Jackets, Jenkins said: \"UCF is just one of those schools that I love the most. The whole coaching staff loves me, and every time I'm down there, they show me how much of a priority I am. (Malzahn) calls me every week, and it's never a peer pressure thing for what they want me to do. It's straight love. It feels like a great atmosphere every time I'm there. They make me feel so welcome, and I feel at home every time I'm there.\"\n\nRounding out the quintet of UCF receiver recruits are a former Miami commit, and a current Miami target.\n\nPalm Beach Central's Waden Charles, who reopened his recruitment May 30, visited this past weekend after taking a trip to Arkansas. Charles (6-3, 190) had 30 receptions for 478 yards and seven touchdowns in 2023.\n\nFinally, Tyler Williams (6-2, 198), who recently transferred to Armwood from Sumner, was UCF's lone attendee the weekend of June 7. He averaged 22.5 yards per reception and scored 19 touchdowns, including five special teams returns, for Sumner and is being pursued by, among others, Miami, Syracuse and Georgia.\n\nAn Orlando native, Cincinnati Anderson's Caden Piening declared his intentions of a homecoming in April. He committed to the Knights one day after attending the spring game, and returned May 31 for his official visit.\n\n247Sports compares Piening (6-4, 240) favorably to a former Knight -- Jordan Akins, a six-year NFL veteran who is currently with the Cleveland Browns. Piening caught 35 passes for 624 yards and five touchdowns at Anderson this past season.\n\nFlorida, however, brought Piening in for an official visit this past weekend and he met with Gators head coach Billy Napier for the first time in a significant capacity, according to 247Sports' Blake Alderman. Of note, the Gators hosted four tight ends the previous two weekends: Tae'Shaun Gelsey, Micah Jones, Andrew Olesh and Hollis Davidson.\n\nUCF could also still be in the running for Calhoun (Ga.)'s four-star prospect Emaree Winston (6-2, 230), who had the Knights in his top three before committing to Texas on Dec. 18. Winston took an official visit this weekend, and he is scheduled to head to Austin on Friday.\n\nThis is shaping up to be, comfortably, UCF's largest high school offensive line haul in Malzahn's tenure. The Knights have taken two or fewer linemen from the prep ranks in each of the past four cycles, instead showing a preference for the transfer portal.\n\nUCF already has two interior targets committed: Cocoa's Jaquez Joiner (6-3, 260) and Wiregrass Ranch's Gavin Blanchard (6-3, 300).\n\nSeminole's Max Buchanan (6-5, 300) is a priority, though the Knights face competition from Florida State, Miami, Clemson and others. He told The News-Journal that he is targeting early August for a commitment. Roswell (Ga.)'s Andrew Stargel (6-4, 305) is another primary target with Ohio State and N.C. State also in the running.\n\nTackle is a need to fill in the class, and UCF's preferences include Warner Robins (Ga.) Northside's Chastan Brown and Orlando Christian Prep's Demetrius Campbell. Anna Adams, of 247Sports, forecasted a UCF pick for consensus four-star recruit Brown (6-8, 260) on June 3, but Louisville reportedly made a strong impression the following week.\n\nMiami is the reported leader for Campbell (6-6, 300) following his June 7 trip. If Campbell chooses the Hurricanes, it would be Miami's second triumph over UCF in the trenches after previously securing Fletcher guard TaKaylen Muex.\n\nThe Knights could intensify recruitment on a player that decommitted from the Hurricanes in Gadsden County tackle Lamar Williams (6-7, 285). He received a verbal offer on May 8, reopened his recruitment the next day and visited Maryland earlier this month.\n\nUCF is all-in on Cocoa's Javion Hilson, the nation's top-ranked edge rusher who flipped his commitment from Alabama to Florida State in the aftermath of Nick Saban's retirement. A consensus top-75 prospect, Hilson (6-5, 235) totaled 14 sacks for Cocoa in a title-winning junior season.\n\nHilson heard what the Knights had to say this past weekend, telling Rivals, \"They compared me to John Walker. ... He was highly ranked too and could have gone anywhere like Alabama, Georgia, all that. That's similar to me. I'm currently committed to Florida State right now, but I can go anywhere I want to.\n\n\"But UCF, after this visit, kind of has me thinking.\"\n\nBeyond Hilson, UCF is also working to land Pace's Tylon Lee (6-5, 235), Buchholz's Nick Clayton (6-5, 215) and Norland's Desir twins, Darryll (6-5, 244) and Mandrell (6-4, 245). Those four players combined for 18 sacks last fall.\n\nMoving inside, UCF took the first shot at flipping longtime Auburn commit and Opelika (Ala.) defensive tackle Malik Autry, who has since visited USC and Florida. Autry (6-6, 283) earned five-star distinction from 247Sports and is intrigued at the possibility of being the Knights' first such signee. He visited for both the spring game and Bounce House Weekend.\n\nNewberry teammates Jarquez Carter (6-3, 270) and Mykah Newton (6-3, 260) visited UCF together last weekend, and Mainland's Christian Hudson (6-2, 290) kicked off a busy month with a short drive over to Orlando. Hudson has since gone to Iowa State and Maryland, and will close with a visit to Iowa before committing on July 6.\n\nCovington (Ga.) Newton three-star defensive tackle RyShawn Perry (6-3, 275), the younger brother of former UCF safety Koby Perry, committed to the Knights in April.\n\nDespite his commitment to Ohio State at the end of March, Vero Beach's Tarvos Alford II (6-2, 210) continues to be a major target for UCF -- understandably so, considering he's the No. 5 player at the position according to 247Sports' composite rankings. Alford, the reigning TCPalm Defensive Player of the Year, told USA TODAY Florida Network recruiting reporter Jon Santucci that he was \"locked in with the Buckeyes,\" but would take visits. He has since gone to Illinois and UCF, in addition to booking an in-season trip to Florida State.\n\nThe Knights have one linebacker in the boat: South Sumter's Malakhi Boone (6-2, 230). A three-year varsity starter, Boone has collected 294 tackles (75 solo), 61 tackles for loss, 19 sacks, three interceptions and 12 pass breakups to date.\n\nAnother player to monitor is Armwood's Cameron White (6-1, 225), another May 31 weekend visitor. White, who also jumped ship from Sumner following a coaching change, had 81 tackles, 13 TFLs, five sacks and four quarterback hurries. West Virginia, Syracuse, Louisville and N.C. State are all in the mix.\n\nOn one hand, UCF's secondary is somewhat solidified thanks to three early commitments. Thomasville (Ga.) Thomas County Central safety Kendarius Reddick (6-0, 180), Palm Beach Central cornerback Tony Williams (6-2, 190) and Cedartown (Ga.) cornerback Demarcus Gardner (6-0, 170) remain steadfast, though the latter went to Kentucky over the weekend.\n\nOn the other, UCF is still pursuing at least three more players.\n\nVero Beach's RJ Jones III (6-2, 170) committed to N.C. State on June 9 following his official visit, but the Knights had him on campus this past weekend and feel optimistic about their chances in the long run.\n\nAs for safety, UCF's priorities still on the board are Atlanta (Ga.) Frederick Douglass' Jontae Gilbert (6-1, 185) and Escambia's Ladarian Clardy (6-0, 180), another pair of consensus four-star talents.\n\nSet to play in the 2025 All-American Bowl, Gilbert plans to wait until October to make a final decision, allowing for a September trip to South Carolina. Previously an Ohio State commit, he's also gone to Louisville and Georgia, and he is due to visit N.C. State and Georgia State before the month concludes.\n\nAs for Clardy, UCF believes it is in a good spot despite competition from Florida State, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Miami. He helped Escambia reach the Region 1-3S final as a junior, tallying 57 tackles, four interceptions and eight PBUs.\n\nEastman (Ga.) Dodge County safety Duke Johnson (6-1, 200) continues to be committed to Alabama, though the consensus top-50 national recruit has also visited UCF and Auburn this month.", "source": {"uri":

State commit) and Vero Beach linebacker (Ohio State commit) join the show.\n\nORLANDO -- Three consecutive weekends of official visits at UCF are done, and so too is the bulk of the in-person recruiting work for head coach Gus Malzahn and his staff regarding the 2025 graduating class.\n\nNow, the waiting game begins -- with a handful of the Knights' top targets set to decide before the summer ends.\n\nLast July proved particularly fruitful. In the month's first eight days, UCF landed six of its 2024 signees -- including three of its four All-Americans: offensive lineman Waltclaire Flynn Jr., linebacker Qua Birdsong and tight end Kylan Fox. Not to mention, Dr. Phillips safety/linebacker Jashad Presley committed on the final day of June, and Benjamin offensive tackle Chase Malamala joined the class the following week.\n\nThey're in the game: UCF players share excitement, high expectations for EA Sports College Football 25\n\nWho's in? Who's gone? Analyzing UCF football's transfer portal additions, losses during spring window\n\nWill there be another bevy of booms on the horizon?\n\nHere is a position-by-position breakdown of UCF's recruiting targets, and where things stand following the flurry of visits.\n\nQuarterback\n\nThe name to watch among UCF's quarterback targets is Malik Washington, an Elite 11 finalist hailing from Severn (Md.) Archbishop Spalding. Of the 20 competitors at this week's national showcase for signal-callers in Los Angeles, Washington is one of just two that are uncommitted -- along with Jaron Keawe Sagapolutele out of Hawaii.\n\nWashington (6-foot-5, 200 pounds) is a consensus four-star recruit, rated 14th among all 2025 quarterbacks by 247Sports. Named Player of the Year by the Capital Gazette in each of the last two seasons, Washington completed 62.3% of his passes (62.3%) for 2,093 yards with 21 touchdowns and nine interceptions, adding 204 yards and six scores on the ground.\n\n\"The last time (Malzahn) had a quarterback built like me, he went and won a national championship with Cam Newton,\" Washington said after his UCF visit. \"I think I fit (the offense) pretty well.\"\n\nHe visited UCF the weekend of May 31, and has also taken trips to Virginia Tech and Syracuse. Maryland will get Washington's last visit this coming weekend after the Elite 11 event, and both Tom Loy and Brian Dohn of 247Sports predict he will stay close to home and choose the Terrapins.\n\nUCF brought in a second Elite 11 finalist to kick off June in Macon (Miss.) Noxubee County's KaMario Taylor, who has been committed to Mississippi State since Oct. 13. Taylor accounted for more than 4,400 yards of total offense and 63 touchdowns during his junior campaign.\n\nKJ Jefferson will be a one-and-done player for UCF, but the Knights have long-term options waiting in the wings. Miami transfer Jacurri Brown still has three years of eligibility, while redshirt freshman Dylan Rizk and true freshmen Riley Trujillo and EJ Colson each have four.\n\nRunning back\n\nOsceola's Taevion Swint became the Knights' first commit more than 14 months ago -- announcing his pledge following the 2023 spring game. He took his lone official visit to date on May 31.\n\nSwint (5-10, 180) is a top-25 national player at the position, according to the four major recruiting services (247, On3, Rivals and ESPN), and a top-300 overall recruit. He has rushed for 2,880 yards and 38 touchdowns across three varsity seasons, though he was limited to six games last fall due to injury.\n\n\"I'm back and better,\" said Swint, a high school teammate of Knights defensive linemen John Walker and Derrick Leblanc. \"Last year was just a bump in the road. I've come back real strong and hard for the rest of the guys that were doubting me.\"\n\nHis spring game performance -- nearly 200 yards and three TDs against Edgewater and DeLand -- backed up that claim. Swint could well be the key piece of this recruiting class, and a focal point of Malzahn's run-heavy offense.\n\nUCF made a run at Plant's Waltez Clark, envisioning him in an all-purpose athlete role, but the Florida commit canceled a June 7-9 visit after he attended Bounce House Weekend in an unofficial capacity the weekend prior.\n\nWide receiver\n\nFirst-year offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach Tim Harris Jr. is determined to bring in proven playmakers from championship-level programs, including last year's selection as Mr. Football throughout the state of Florida.\n\nCocoa's Jayvan Boggs (6-1, 190) will choose between UCF and Missouri on July 4, having canceled scheduled trips to USC and Georgia. Boggs reopened his recruitment in March after committing to Ohio State and landed verbal offers from a number of established bluebloods, including Texas and Oregon.\n\nBoggs, who caught 93 balls for 1,493 yards and 23 touchdowns for the Class 2S state champion Tigers, was among the last to leave Bounce House Weekend and has been a frequent UCF visitor over the last year.\n\nTampa Bay Tech's Santonyo Isaac (6-1, 170) verbally committed to the Knights on the afternoon of the Gasparilla Bowl in December and has built a strong connection with Harris since he rejoined the program from Miami. Isaac caught 30 passes for 695 yards and tied Oregon commit Dallas Wilson for the Titans' team lead in TD receptions (nine).\n\nSt. Augustine's Carl Jenkins Jr. (6-2, 177) listed UCF among his top four schools last week, along with Louisville, Mississippi State and South Florida. Fresh off a 60-catch, 1,172-yard and 15-touchdown season for the Class 3S runner-up Yellow Jackets, Jenkins said: \"UCF is just one of those schools that I love the most. The whole coaching staff loves me, and every time I'm down there, they show me how much of a priority I am. (Malzahn) calls me every week, and it's never a peer pressure thing for what they want me to do. It's straight love. It feels like a great atmosphere every time I'm there. They make me feel so welcome, and I feel at home every time I'm there.\"\n\nRounding out the quintet of UCF receiver recruits are a former Miami commit, and a current Miami target.\n\nPalm Beach Central's Waden Charles, who reopened his recruitment May 30, visited this past weekend after taking a trip to Arkansas. Charles (6-3, 190) had 30 receptions for 478 yards and seven touchdowns in 2023.\n\nFinally, Tyler Williams (6-2, 198), who recently transferred to Armwood from Sumner, was UCF's lone attendee the weekend of June 7. He averaged 22.5 yards per reception and scored 19 touchdowns, including five special teams returns, for Sumner and is being pursued by, among others, Miami, Syracuse and Georgia.\n\nTight end\n\nAn Orlando native, Cincinnati Anderson's Caden Piening declared his intentions of a homecoming in April. He committed to the Knights one day after attending the spring game, and returned May 31 for his official visit.\n\n247Sports compares Piening (6-4, 240) favorably to a former Knight -- Jordan Akins, a six-year NFL veteran who is currently with the Cleveland Browns. Piening caught 35 passes for 624 yards and five touchdowns at Anderson this past season.\n\nFlorida, however, brought Piening in for an official visit this past weekend and he met with Gators head coach Billy Napier for the first time in a significant capacity, according to 247Sports' Blake Alderman. Of note, the Gators hosted four tight ends the previous two weekends: Tae'Shaun Gelsey, Micah Jones, Andrew Olesh and Hollis Davidson.\n\nUCF could also still be in the running for Calhoun (Ga.)'s four-star prospect Emaree Winston (6-2, 230), who had the Knights in his top three before committing to Texas on Dec. 18. Winston took an official visit this weekend, and he is scheduled to head to Austin on Friday.\n\nOffensive line\n\nThis is shaping up to be, comfortably, UCF's largest high school offensive line haul in Malzahn's tenure. The Knights have taken two or fewer linemen from the prep ranks in each of the past four cycles, instead showing a preference for the transfer portal.\n\nUCF already has two interior targets committed: Cocoa's Jaquez Joiner (6-3, 260) and Wiregrass Ranch's Gavin Blanchard (6-3, 300).\n\nSeminole's Max Buchanan (6-5, 300) is a priority, though the Knights face competition from Florida State, Miami, Clemson and others. He told The News-Journal that he is targeting early August for a commitment. Roswell (Ga.)'s Andrew Stargel (6-4, 305) is another primary target with Ohio State and N.C. State also in the running.\n\nTackle is a need to fill in the class, and UCF's preferences include Warner Robins (Ga.) Northside's Chastan Brown and Orlando Christian Prep's Demetrius Campbell. Anna Adams, of 247Sports, forecasted a UCF pick for consensus four-star recruit Brown (6-8, 260) on June 3, but Louisville reportedly made a strong impression the following week.\n\nMiami is the reported leader for Campbell (6-6, 300) following his June 7 trip. If Campbell chooses the Hurricanes, it would be Miami's second triumph over UCF in the trenches after previously securing Fletcher guard TaKaylen Muex.\n\nThe Knights could intensify recruitment on a player that decommitted from the Hurricanes in Gadsden County tackle Lamar Williams (6-7, 285). He received a verbal offer on May 8, reopened his recruitment the next day and visited Maryland earlier this month.\n\nDefensive line\n\nUCF is all-in on Cocoa's Javion Hilson, the nation's top-ranked edge rusher who flipped his commitment from Alabama to Florida State in the aftermath of Nick Saban's retirement. A consensus top-75 prospect, Hilson (6-5, 235) totaled 14 sacks for Cocoa in a title-winning junior season.\n\nHilson heard what the Knights had to say this past weekend, telling Rivals, \"They compared me to John Walker. ... He was highly ranked too and could have gone anywhere like Alabama, Georgia, all that. That's similar to me. I'm currently committed to Florida State right now, but I can go anywhere I want to.\n\n\"But UCF, after this visit, kind of has me thinking.\"\n\nBeyond Hilson, UCF is also working to land Pace's Tylon Lee (6-5, 235), Buchholz's Nick Clayton (6-5, 215) and Norland's Desir twins, Darryll (6-5, 244) and Mandrell (6-4, 245). Those four players combined for 18 sacks last fall.\n\nMoving inside, UCF took the first shot at flipping longtime Auburn commit and Opelika (Ala.) defensive tackle Malik Autry, who has since visited USC and Florida. Autry (6-6, 283) earned five-star distinction from 247Sports and is intrigued at the possibility of being the Knights' first such signee. He visited for both the spring game and Bounce House Weekend.\n\nNewberry teammates Jarquez Carter (6-3, 270) and Mykah Newton (6-3, 260) visited UCF together last weekend, and Mainland's Christian Hudson (6-2, 290) kicked off a busy month with a short drive over to Orlando. Hudson has since gone to Iowa State and Maryland, and will close with a visit to Iowa before committing on July 6.\n\nCovington (Ga.) Newton three-star defensive tackle RyShawn Perry (6-3, 275), the younger brother of former UCF safety Koby Perry, committed to the Knights in April.\n\nLinebacker\n\nDespite his commitment to Ohio State at the end of March, Vero Beach's Tarvos Alford II (6-2, 210) continues to be a major target for UCF -- understandably so, considering he's the No. 5 player at the position according to 247Sports' composite rankings. Alford, the reigning TCPalm Defensive Player of the Year, told USA TODAY Florida Network recruiting reporter Jon Santucci that he was \"locked in with the Buckeyes,\" but would take visits. He has since gone to Illinois and UCF, in addition to booking an in-season trip to Florida State.\n\nThe Knights have one linebacker in the boat: South Sumter's Malakhi Boone (6-2, 230). A three-year varsity starter, Boone has collected 294 tackles (75 solo), 61 tackles for loss, 19 sacks, three interceptions and 12 pass breakups to date.\n\nAnother player to monitor is Armwood's Cameron White (6-1, 225), another May 31 weekend visitor. White, who also jumped ship from Sumner following a coaching change, had 81 tackles, 13 TFLs, five sacks and four quarterback hurries. West Virginia, Syracuse, Louisville and N.C. State are all in the mix.\n\nDefensive back\n\nOn one hand, UCF's secondary is somewhat solidified thanks to three early commitments. Thomasville (Ga.) Thomas County Central safety Kendarius Reddick (6-0, 180), Palm Beach Central cornerback Tony Williams (6-2, 190) and Cedartown (Ga.) cornerback Demarcus Gardner (6-0, 170) remain steadfast, though the latter went to Kentucky over the weekend.\n\nOn the other, UCF is still pursuing at least three more players.\n\nVero Beach's RJ Jones III (6-2, 170) committed to N.C. State on June 9 following his official visit, but the Knights had him on campus this past weekend and feel optimistic about their chances in the long run.\n\nAs for safety, UCF's priorities still on the board are Atlanta (Ga.) Frederick Douglass' Jontae Gilbert (6-1, 185) and Escambia's Ladarian Clardy (6-0, 180), another pair of consensus four-star talents.\n\nSet to play in the 2025 All-American Bowl, Gilbert plans to wait until October to make a final decision, allowing for a September trip to South Carolina. Previously an Ohio State commit, he's also gone to Louisville and Georgia, and he is due to visit N.C. State and Georgia State before the month concludes.\n\nAs for Clardy, UCF believes it is in a good spot despite competition from Florida State, Mississippi State, Ole Miss and Miami. He helped Escambia reach the Region 1-3S final as a junior, tallying 57 tackles, four interceptions and eight PBUs.\n\nEastman (Ga.) Dodge County safety Duke Johnson (6-1, 200) continues to be committed to Alabama, though the consensus top-50 national recruit has also visited UCF and Auburn this month.", "source": {"uri":

It's also no secret why most of them come: theme parks. But what visitors and locals alike do not notice at the parks is the software that makes it possible for them to be open and operating.\n\n\"Much of the research that drives the parks is done right here at home,\" says Rob Panepinto, senior strategic advisor and director Innovation Districts Strategy and Partnerships at the UCF Incubation Program. \"Yet the story of Central Florida as a hub of technology is lost on most people, including people who live here.\"\n\nThe technology isn't all for fun and games either. Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis ranks the Orlando region No. 22 in the nation and No. 1 in Florida for producing tech talent, with UCF as the main pipeline. UCF is one of the few universities in the nation offering undergraduate degrees and graduate programs and certificates in cybersecurity, augmented reality, virtual reality and fintech. For years, UCF has been ranked the No. 1 supplier of graduates to the aerospace and defense industries. Nearly one in three employees at Kennedy Space Center are UCF graduates. U.S. News and World Report has ranked UCF the No. 15 most innovative university in the nation. Among public universities in the U.S., UCF ranks 21st for producing patents.\n\nThe numbers go on and on, and some of them are about fun and games. Princeton Review has named the Florida Interactive Entertainment Academy (FIEA) at UCF the top graduate-level game development program for three consecutive years.\n\n\"I think sometimes we might take for granted what we have here at UCF,\" says Agere Chair Professor in the Department of Computer Science and AR/VR pioneer Carolina Cruz-Neira. \"We have tech experts in decarbonization, energy, cybersecurity, healthcare, nanotechnology, blockchain, a broad spectrum of specialties. That's what makes it exciting as a faculty member -- one day we're working on technology for cancer research, the next day it's traffic safety, and then mental health. It's why my husband and I came to UCF in January 2020. We wanted to be a part of this.\"\n\nCruz-Neira and her husband, Associate Professor of Computer Science Dirk Reiners, had known about UCF's status in tech research and simulation for years. As world-renown pioneers in augmented and virtual reality, they'd travel to Orlando for presentations and conferences. While inspiring others with their own work, they would be mutually wowed with the leading-edge simulation advancements being made in Research Park.\n\n\"We were professionally lonely at other institutions,\" Cruz-Neira says. \"We would try to explain to people the challenging research necessary to produce effective virtual reality applications. Here at UCF, we immediately became part of a larger team of experts in VR and in other fields. Every day we're collaborating and tackling answers to larger problems.\"\n\nThere's an even bigger motivating factor for them: students.\n\n\"The students are learning new technologies at the same time we're researching them,\" says Cruz-Neira. \"They're enthusiastic about the material because they have the freedom to apply what they learn in our VR classes to biology, psychology, hospitality, whatever they're interested in.\"\n\nWhen she was working toward her doctorate in computer engineering in Illinois, instructors would ask Cruz-Neira why she was there. There were no other women in the program. Early in her career, most of the other women she saw working in VR were artists.\n\n\"The environment here at UCF is different,\" she says. \"There are many women in technical leadership and senior positions. For example, the director of the School of Modeling, Simulation and Training is a woman, Grace Bochenek '98PhD. Instructors come together from all backgrounds to explore the next next big thing, which makes UCF effective in preparing new pioneers.\"\n\nYan Solihin is a professor of computer science and director of the Cyber Security and Privacy faculty cluster initiative at UCF. His research in the high-demand field could have taken Solihin to any institution in the country. He chose this one.\n\n\"There's an energy at UCF that you don't find in many places,\" Solihin says. \"The faculty is allowed to look to the future without the restrictions of a legacy institution. That's among the reasons we have strong partnerships in the technology sector -- major corporations know that we're a growing powerhouse.\"\n\nThe UCF powerhouse sends graduates into careers with companies that have a presence near campus, like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Siemens, L3 Harris, EA Sports and Google. The U.S. government uses UCF's deep pool of tech talent to ramp up the Department of Defense and Department of Energy.\n\nAs Solihin says, \"We have the critical mass.\"\n\nIn the past decade, enrollment in computer science related majors has more than quadrupled and is approaching 5,000. The majors are aligned with current and future needs. There are degrees at various levels for digital forensics, computer vision, optics and photonics, and modeling and simulation of behavior cybersecurity. Just one year after launching the master's program in cybersecurity, Solihin believes there will be more than 100 applicants very soon.\n\n\"Our successes,\" he says, \"are predictors of more great things to come.\"\n\nThe real surprise in all of this is that UCF would be considered an unheralded producer of tech talent. The university was founded in 1963 as Florida Technological University for the purpose of feeding the space program with research and expertise. Tourism in Orlando didn't become an economic force until the 1970s.\n\n\"Innovation, especially in engineering, has always been part of UCF's fabric,\" says Panepinto. \"Now it's a matter of scaling the talent into other fields. Look at the structure of the fintech program. It combines business and engineering, which makes it unlike anywhere else.\"\n\nAjai Singh came to UCF in 2015 with the charge of building UCF's finance department into a nationally recognized tech-savvy training ground. Crypto and Venmo were not yet on the general public's radar, so he knew there were opportunities to get out in front of the fintech movement. Other universities were trying to do the same thing -- NYU within its business school, Duke within its college of engineering, a few schools with basic fintech courses.\n\nUCF's version of a fintech program, however, would establish a new template: it would be developed jointly between the finance department and the College of Engineering and Computer Science.\n\n\"The culture of creativity and collaboration that made the space program so effective is still here,\" Singh says. \"No other institutions have this kind of research and relationships between departments.\"\n\nTo take the fintech program to yet another level, Singh sought to build an all-star team of instructors and researchers, like Christo Pirinsky, who had co-written a paper that everyone in the field held almost as gospel.\n\n\"When Christo and several others agreed to join us,\" Singh says, \"they gave us the backbone in fintech that cannot be matched.\"\n\nPirinsky had been working with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He'd taught at other universities around the country. But he saw an opportunity to be part of something special at UCF.\n\n\"If you look at high-tech centers around the world, they emerge close to universities,\" Pirinsky says. \"So, I believe the fintech program will only make Orlando and UCF more prominent. It's a vibrant scene and the trajectory is upward.\"\n\nLeaders at other universities around the country are already asking Singh and Pirinsky how they might mirror what's happening at UCF.\n\n\"I've only been in Central Florida for a few years and can feel the reputation as a hub of technology is at an inflection point,\" Singh says. \"The corporate world knows it. Other schools know it. I believe everyone is about to know it.\"", "source": {"uri": "ucf.edu", "dataType": "news", "title": "University of Central Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

UCF then lost to Georgia Tech in the Gasparilla Bowl.\n\nThere were a couple of changes to Gus Malzahn's staff, but things have been trending up in Orlando for the coach who won a national championship at Auburn.\n\nThe Knights had the third-ranked recruiting class in the Big 12 in the most recent cycle and the second-ranked transfer portal class (trailing only CU) in the conference.\n\nThe big-name addition is former Arkansas quarterback KJ Jefferson, who was one of the most dynamic players in the country in 2022 before seeing a significant drop-off last season. We'll see if that dip was coaching-related or if his success will be contained to that magic season two years ago.\n\nRegardless, there is enough talent on the roster both from the high school ranks and college transfers that it wouldn't be a surprise to see UCF emerge as a promising program to watch in the coming years.\n\nOn offense\n\nWhile Jefferson will play a big role in the Knights' offense as a dual-threat quarterback, UCF already has an established identity.\n\nThe team ranked eighth in the country in yards per game in 2023, and that was in large part due to a rushing attack that ranked fifth.\n\nIn a conference loaded with star running backs, UCF's RJ Harvey can get lost in the shuffle behind the likes of Oklahoma State's Ollie Gordon II and Texas Tech's Tahj Brooks. But Harvey is as good as it gets in college football.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

He likely won't see the same workload due to a talented backfield partner in Toledo transfer Peny Boone, who had nearly identical stats as Harvey -- 1,400 rushing yards and 15 touchdowns.\n\nWith a veteran offensive line, there's a good chance UCF once again has a top-five rushing attack.\n\nOn defense\n\nThis side of the ball will make or break the Knights.\n\nDespite a top-10 offense, UCF's defense ranked 81st in yards allowed per game and 59th in points allowed per game, which played a major role in the 0-5 start to conference play.\n\nThere are plenty of new faces on defense as a handful of transfers could make up for a large portion of the starting lineup.\n\nThe biggest name that returned is defensive lineman Lee Hunter, who stands 6-foot-4, 320 pounds and was honorable mention all-Big 12 after racking up more tackles than any other defensive tackle in the country, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nHunter started all 13 games and had 11 tackles for loss and three sacks and could be the top interior defensive lineman in the Big 12 in 2024.\n\nThe UCF Knights file\n\nHead coach: Gus Malzahn (4th season)\n\nCo-Offensive coordinators: Tim Harris Jr. (1st season) and Darin

Optimism is high to take a big step forward. If quarterback KJ Jefferson can effectively lead the offense and the defensive changes click, UCF could be a sleeper team to contend in the new-look Big 12.\n\nORDER NOW: Athlon Sports 2024 College Football Preview Guide\n\nUCF 2024 Season Preview and PredictionPreviewing UCF's Offense for 2024\n\nUCF head coach Gus Malzahn says he felt like he hit a home run when he landed former Arkansas quarterback KJ Jefferson from the transfer portal. Malzahn was looking for a veteran to replace John Rhys Plumlee, and he found it in Jefferson, a three-year starter for the Razorbacks with 39 career starts. His build and skill set have often been compared to one of Malzahn's former quarterbacks, Cam Newton.\n\nRunning back RJ Harvey rushed for 1,416 yards in 2023, a total that ranks No. 3 all-time in UCF's record books. With Javon Baker off to the NFL, Kobe Hudson becomes UCF's de facto No. 1 wide receiver. Last year, he closely trailed Baker in receptions (44) and yards (900) but was first on the team with eight touchdown receptions. The offensive line is headlined by left tackle Amari Kight.\n\nRelated: College Football Rankings for 2024\n\nPreviewing UCF's Defense for 2024\n\nUCF's defense was not up to the task during the team's Big 12 debut, particularly vs. the run, prompting Malzahn to make a change at defensive coordinator. He looked to veteran coach Ted Roof, with whom he worked during Auburn's 2010 national championship season.\n\nUCF also went big on experience in the transfer portal, bringing in proven starters such as linebacker Ethan Barr (Vanderbilt), linebacker/safety Deshawn Pace (Cincinnati) and cornerback Ladarius Tennison (Ole Miss).\n\nThe strength of the unit, though, could be at defensive tackle, led by multi-year starters Ricky Barber and Lee Hunter.\n\nDefensive end Malachi Lawrence had a breakout season in 2023, finishing second on the team with 7.5 sacks along with 10.5 tackles for a loss to earn All-Big 12 Honorable Mention status.\n\nBrandon Adams, a starter at cornerback since his freshman year in 2021, anchors the secondary.\n\nRelated: Big 12 Coaches Talk Anonymously About Conference Foes for 2024\n\nPreviewing UCF's Specialists for 2024\n\nKicker Colton Boomer followed a big freshman debut with a monster start to 2023, connecting on a school-record four field goals, including the walk-off winner to beat Boise State on the road. Mitch McCarthy, a 27-year-old Australian, returns for his third season as punter.

It's just old school-based defense.\n\nUCF AD: Big football-game guarantees part of doing business now\n\n\"'[Tim's] been with me for two years and we know each other really well. He understands what I like to do, what we like to do [offensively].\"\n\nWhile this season's figures are well below the $1.15 million Roof made at Oklahoma last season, his contract is incentive-laden in the first year, paying the 60-year-old coach:\n\nUCF ranked ninth in the conference in opponent points per possession, 10th in takeaways per game, eighth in third-down defense and 11th in opponent yards per rush last season.\n\nMeanwhile, Oklahoma finished in the top four in all these categories.\n\nRoof and Harris also receive an additional half month's salary if UCF plays in a bowl game without winning a conference championship game. They would receive an entire month's pay if the Knights play in a bowl game after winning the conference championship.\n\nRoof's deal also pays him two months' salary if the team makes the 12-team College Football Playoff and three months if UCF wins the CFP National Championship this season.\n\nDespite the pay cut, Roof's salary remains highly competitive. It's not far off from the average salary of a Big 12 assistant coach, which was $474,775 in 2021 and increased to an average of $512,947 in 2023.\n\nIf UCF chooses to part ways with Roof, the school would be on the hook to play the guaranteed base salary for the remainder of the contract term and any incentives accrued but not yet paid. If he chooses to leave before the term of his contract, Roof owes the remaining amount of his guaranteed annual compensation unless he accepts a head coaching job or if Malzahn is no longer the head coach.\n\nHarris' buyout is similar. The school owes him the remainder of his guaranteed salary based on the terms of his contract, which is reduced by subsequent employment after the fact. If he chooses to leave before the final regular-season game or conference championship game of the 2024 season, Harris must pay the school the remaining amount of his guaranteed contract.\n\nHey, kids, if you want to be an NFL (or NIL) millionaire, let UCF and Jaguars star Gabe Davis show you how to work out | Commentary\n\nIf he chooses to leave after the 2024 season but before the 2025 season, Harris is responsible for a buyout equal to 50% of the remaining balance on his contract. Although, he owes the school nothing if he accepts a head coaching job.\n\nUCF's highest-paid assistant coaches last season were Addison Williams ($700,000), who had been promoted to defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach, and Darin Hinshaw ($600,000) who was hired as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\n\nDuring the offseason, UCF's coaching staff underwent significant changes. Williams, who had been promoted to defensive coordinator and defensive backs coach, assumed a co-defensive coordinator role. Hinshaw, who was hired as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach, became co-offensive coordinator.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_murschel@sun-sentinel.com", "name": "Matt Murschel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Roof", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ted Roof"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCF_Knights_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UCF Knights football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gus_Malzahn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gus Malzahn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_Sooners_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma Sooners football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football_national_championships_in_NCAA_Division_I_FBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowl_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bowl game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auburn_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auburn Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff_National_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff National Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_12_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big 12 Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College Football Playoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabe_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabe Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darin_Hinshaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darin Hinshaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TOS-L-ucf-football-ted-roof-0321-01.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665669", "eventUri": "eng-9665669", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

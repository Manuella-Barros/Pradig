In addition to featuring a variety of hit songs from her iconic career, which has been going strong for over 50 years, Parton is also set to write a collection of new tracks purposefully for the production.\n\nFor the show book, Parton has teamed up with Maria S. Schlatter. The singer-songwriter will also produce the project alongside her manager Danny Nozell and Adam Speers from ATG Productions. As of yet, an exact opening date hasn't been revealed nor has a specific theatre in New York.\n\nIn a statement, Parton shared her excitement of the forthcoming project: \"Hello, I'm Dolly, and I lived my whole life to see this show on stage. I've written many original songs for the show and included all your favorites in it as well. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll clap, you'll stomp, it truly is a Grand Ol' Opera. Pun and fun intended. Don't miss it!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Speers from ATG Production explained of his involvement and relationship with Parton: \"I first had the pleasure of working with Dolly Parton in 2019 when she trusted us to develop a new version of her musical 9 to 5 for London's West End.\"\n\nSpeers went onto say how he'd previously been told the singer \"wanted to do a musical based on her life\" and revealed he was \"bowled over\" when \"she asked if I would be interested in producing it\".\n\nHe added: \"As the world knows, Dolly is a magical blend of talent, hard work, intelligence, charm, wit, and a gigantically big heart. I'm thrilled we're going to bring her inspiring story to Broadway.\"\n\nAlthough Parton is now retired from touring, she's determined not to show any signs of slowing down. Notably, in 2023, she moved into the realm of rock 'n' roll with her appropriately named album, Rockstar, which featured guest appearances from Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Debbie Harry, Joan Jett and Stevie Nicks.\n\nIn a four-and-a-half star review, Far Out wrote: \"Throughout the entire extended album, there is rarely a moment when the goosebumps dissipate. It is the kind of record that makes your jaw swing open at the sheer spectacle of it. Even in the first two tracks, 'Rockstar' and 'World On Fire', it's like Parton smashes through who she's perceived to be and becomes something a million times more powerful. 'Rockstar' is rock music on its grandest, most theatrical scale.\"\n\nNow, after conquering rock 'n' roll, Parton has another target in her mind: Broadway. As the opening date of Hello, I'm Dolly inches closer, more details will trickle out regarding the production, which looks set to be another ambitious project.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_taysom@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Joe Taysom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dolly Parton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Adele_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hello (Adele song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talent_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talent manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West End theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debbie_Harry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debbie Harry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Jett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan Jett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock and roll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McCartney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul McCartney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringo_Starr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ringo Starr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_(Post_Malone_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rockstar (Post Malone song)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Styles", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2023/07/Dolly-Parton-Rockstar-2023-Far-Out-Magazine.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630797", "eventUri": "eng-9630797", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

But don't get set on saying hello too soon -- it's being aimed at a 2026 opening.\n\nParton's score for the show is being described as a mixture of newly written songs and \"all your favorites.\" The singer is co-writing the book for the autobiographical production with Maria S. Schlatter, who previously co-wrote the 2020 Netflix movie \"Christmas on the Square\" with Parton.\n\nProducers for the planned production are Parton, Adam Speers for ATG Productions and Danny Nozell for CTK Enterprises. ATG currently has the hit \"Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club\" running on Broadway and recently produced a revival of \"Sunset Boulevard\" with Nicole Scherzinger. CTK is a Nashville-based management company, led by Nozell, that has Parton as its most famous client.\n\nParton announced plans for the show Thursday morning at CMA Fest in Nashville, making a speaking appearance on the opening day of the country festival as part of the daytime Fan Fair activities.\n\nNot surprisingly for a show this far out from its target date, casting, creative hires and a theater have yet to be announced.\n\nParton is no newcomer to Broadway, having previously written the score for a stage adaptation of the film \"9 to 5\" that opened at the Ahmanson in L.A. and earned her a Tony nomination in 2009 after making the move to New York. It was through a pre-pandemic British revival of that show that she met a key producer driving this production.\n\nSaid Speers in a statement, \"I first had the pleasure of working with Dolly Parton in 2019 when she trusted us to develop a new version of her musical '9 to 5' for London's West End. I had always heard she wanted to do a musical based on her life, so when she asked if I would be interested in producing it, I was bowled over. As the world knows, Dolly is a magical blend of talent, hard work, intelligence, charm, wit and a gigantically big heart. I'm thrilled we're going to bring her inspiring story to Broadway.\"\n\nParton's own prepared statement was as folksy as might be expected. \"Hello, I'm Dolly, and I lived my whole life to see this show on stage,\" she wrote. \"I've written many original songs for the show and included all your favorites in it as well. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll clap, you'll stomp; it truly is a Grand Ol' Opera. Pun and fun intended. Don't miss it!\"\n\nThe show is named after Parton's 1967 debut album, \"Hello, I'm Dolly\" -- an obvious play on the title of \"Hello, Dolly!,\" which became a smash upon opening on Broadway in 1964 and generated a cast album that reached No. 1 that year.\n\nThere are few precedents that make it easy to predict how a Dolly Parton musical might perform on Broadway, but it follows on the heels of other musicals based on singers' lives, including \"A Beautiful Noise, the Neil Diamond Musical,\" \"MJ: The Musical,\" \"Beautiful: The Carole King Musical,\" \"The Cher Show,\" \"Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,\" \"Tina: The Tina Turner Musical\" and, of course, \"Jersey Boys.\"\n\nBut those shows were entirely jukebox musicals and didn't feature the introduction of new songs written by the subject of the show, nor were any of those books co-written by the show's protagonist, as \"Hello, I'm Dolly's\" will be.\n\nCountry music itself has had a mixed record on Broadway. A Loretta Lynn musical based on \"Coal Miner's Daughter\" was announced in 2012 with Zooey Deschanel in the lead. Twelve years later, it has yet to materialize, although development is said to continue. More recently, the all-original country musical \"Shucked\" opened last year to strong reviews, if a shorter-than-hoped run; that show is set for a national tour that begins this fall and extends through an engagement at L.A.'s Pantages in summer 2025.\n\nCountry music musicals from earlier eras include 2003's very short-lived \"Urban Cowboy,\" 1985's successful \"Big River\" (which won country singer-songwriter Roger Miller a Tony) and 1978's \"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,\" which got turned into a 1982 film starring Parton.", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA_Music_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CMA Music Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dolly Parton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Broadway theatre"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_(Adele_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hello (Adele song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_McBryde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashley McBryde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_pop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country pop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sunset Boulevard (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabaret (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello,_Dolly!_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hello, Dolly!

I've always said if my husband was in ill health and needed me, I would pull back -- and the same with my own health. But I kind of dreamed myself into a corner and I need to be responsible for that. I may pull back a little now and then, but not today.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_nicholson@billboard.com", "name": "Jessica Nicholson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dolly Parton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_K._Oermann", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert K.

Hopefully, it will be up and running sometime in 2025:\n\n\"Hello, I'm Dolly! I've been writing my life story as a Broadway musical for several years and I'm proud to announce we are finally developing 'Hello, I'm Dolly - An Original Musical' for the Broadway stage. Head to my story for more information.\"\n\nWhile they haven't announced too many details quite yet, Dolly had previously touched on the idea of doing a musical as she's been writing it for years, though at the time, it wasn't officially in production for Broadway, telling USA Today:\n\n\"We're hoping to have it onstage in 2025. I've been working on it forever. It's not a jukebox musical, it's a true story. It's a big production and a lot of original songs.\n\nOf course it will have the hit songs and the stories leading up to those things. I had at one time planned to do a biopic but then everybody was doing one so I thought nah, I'm going Broadway. So I'm hoping we make it.\"\n\nSomehow, I feel like this will be an even bigger, more glamorous version of Dolly's life than the one we've seen and heard about through her timeless music throughout the years.\n\nGetting on Broadway is of course massive accomplishment, especially writing and producing the show yourself, so I can only imagine what this means to Dolly both personally and professionally. No casting announcement have been made yet, but playing Dolly Parton in her own musical on Broadway? A dream roll for anyone...\n\nShe did say she was holding a casting contest to find the perfect Dolly, so stay tuned for more because I know this will be a one-of-a-kind production that is a dream come true for the country icon.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hello!

The singer will write the music, co-write the book and serve as producer on Hello, I'm Dolly.\n\nThe name of Dolly Parton's new musical is the same of her first studio album, released in 1967. Deadline points out that Parton and Maria S. Schlatter wrote the book for Hello, I'm Dolly. These two worked together previously on Christmas on the Square, which won an Emmy after its release in 2019.\n\nThe theatrical presentation of Parton's life story promises new music and a few hits. It will open Broadway (as in New York City, not Nashville) on an unannounced date in 2026. No cast has been revealed, but ...\n\nAs early as 2009, Parton has named actor-turned-country singer Kristin Chenoweth as someone who could do her justice. PlayBill did a story about Parton's appearance on a holiday special during which the country icon said, \"But seriously, I'm hoping that she might possibly do that when I get finished.\"\n\nParton also told Carrie Underwood that, with a little padding on top, she could do the job too. Older country music fans may recall that Parton's zaftig figure once dominated late night television show monologues.\n\nChenoweth has always seemed open to the idea. She once told Jay Leno she wants to but, \"I'm lacking a couple of things and we both know what they are.\" Several times she's expressed how ready she is.\n\nIn 2022, Parton once again attached Chenoweth to the musical after admitting the COVID-19 halted the significant progress she'd made in developing the idea.\n\nThat came after a 2020 Marie Claire interview, during which Parton said:\n\n\"I love Kristin Chenoweth.

The set was released in late 2023, and it helped the singer-songwriter reach new heights and even place on several Billboard charts she'd never reached before. Only a few months after that title blasted onto the weekly rankings, Parton is back with a pair of singles that show another side of her.\n\nThis week, Parton appears on two Billboard charts. She claims a pair of wins with separate tracks, which are winning on very different lists. Interestingly, both of her new hits see her serving as a featured act, as she's clearly still interested in collaborating with other artists and making as much music as she can.\n\nParton debuts on this week's Adult Contemporary chart with one of her most recent releases. She teamed up with AC/Christian musician Natalie Grant for the single \"Step By Step,\" which this frame opens at No. 27 on the radio list.\n\n\"Step By Step\" is the second-highest-ranking debut on the Adult Contemporary tally this week. The two beloved women come in only a few rungs behind Daryl Hall -- of Hall & Oates fame -- and Dave Stewart. Those two collaborated on a song titled \"Can't Say No to You,\" which launches at No. 25 on the pop radio roster.\n\nAt the same time, Parton is also present on another radio ranking. She sits at No. 31 on the Christian Airplay tally with \"Lookin' for You,\" which lifts to a new peak from No. 34. That track is a collaboration with Zach Williams, and it's now been climbing for nearly two months.\n\nParton has worked with Williams in the past, and after finding great success together, the two are on the hunt for another Christian smash. The pair collaborated on a single titled \"There Was Jesus,\" which dropped in 2021. That song became a quick top 10 on every religious music chart, and it even won them a Grammy.\n\nIt was only a few months ago that Parton claimed several hits on Billboard's rock charts. Now, she appears on the pop and Christian airplay tallies. In another few months, she may earn another country or Americana win as well, as her upcoming project is likely focused on the styles that made her famous in the first place.\n\nAmidst all this current success, Parton is not taking things slow. She recently announced another new album, slated for release toward the end of the year.

They had such good chemistry on The Porter Wagoner Show and in their duets that many wondered if they were having an affair. Parton denied this, but she admitted that they fought like a married couple. Wagoner was also extremely possessive over Parton. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, he didn't allow anyone to ask her any questions.\n\nPart of the reason Wagoner hired Parton was for her image, and he wanted to make sure she kept up appearances. He was \"totally protective -- both of her and of her image,\" said Nashville agent Dolores Smiley in the book Dolly by Alanna Nash. He wouldn't even allow her to appear on the cover of a magazine that included advertisements for clubs that served alcohol.\n\nThe pair of them appeared on The Tonight Show in 1970, and Wagoner fielded every question. He didn't want Parton to answer anything.\n\n\"I just sat on the panel and slung my foot, as usual,\" she later said of the experience.\n\nWhen asked if Wagoner really was as possessive as people believed, Parton brushed off the question.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" she said. \"It was a long time ago.\"\n\nWagoner's protective nature and chemistry with Parton led to endless rumors about an affair between the two of them. Some believed that even if the rumors were not true, Wagoner may have been in love with Parton.\n\n\"The main reason Dolly had such a hard time disentangling herself from Porter is because he was in love with her,\" one journalist said. \"Porter was really torn up over losing Dolly. Really torn up. Because he really did love her, and I don't think he'd ever been in love with anyone but himself. And about Carl Dean, well, you know Porter was the main man in Dolly's life all the years she was with him.\"\n\nParton said that while there was love between them, it wasn't romantic in nature.\n\n\"I have been married for a long time, and I figure that if there had been anything between me and Porter my husband would have been the first to know it, because you cannot deceive people,\" she said. \"Like I say, there was a love of a kind. We never tried to disguise that, because it was as much a respect. We got to know each other and knew our bad side and our good side, we knew our weak points, our strong ones, we knew hang-ups.\"\n\nWhile Parton said she loved Wagoner, their relationship was not easy. They fought often and intensely, with members of their backing band recalling being able to hear them shouting through the halls of hotels.\n\n\"Porter and I fought like cats and dogs,\" Parton wrote in the book Dolly Parton, Songteller: My Life in Lyrics. \"My husband and I have never fought, and Porter and I did nothing but fight.

While she loves to sing, she believes her true talent lies in her abilities as a songwriter. Parton writes every day and is able to finish more than one hit in a single writing session. She recalled that on her most prolific writing day ever, she ended up with over a dozen recordable songs.\n\nParton has said that she sets aside time to write every day, no matter where she is. It's a normal, unshakeable part of her routine.\n\n\"Writing's just as natural to me as getting up and cooking breakfast,\" she told The New York Times. \"I ain't never far away from a pencil and paper or a tape recorder. I write every day, even when I'm on a plane, in the tub, or on the bus. It burns in me. Songwriting is my way of channeling my feelings and my thoughts.\"\n\nA member of Parton's band estimated that she writes up to 20 songs a day. When asked about it, Parton seemed offended that anyone would doubt that.\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" she told writer Alanna Nash in the book Dolly. \"I tell you, a lot of people don't believe that. They think it's a lie, even people who write.\"\n\nAccording to Parton, she ended up recording the majority of these songs. She said the songs \"Take Me Back\" and \"You Are\" came out of this rush of writing.\n\n\"Out of those twenty songs I wrote, fifteen of 'em have been recorded. Because when I get on a real wild streak, look out!\" she said. \"Now it depends on the nature of the song. Up-tempo is easier for me to write, with simple words. But anyway, twenty is the most I've ever written in a setting.\"\n\nThe people who have watched Parton write say she throws herself wholly into the creative process. She's hardly aware of anything but putting lyrics to the page.\n\n\"I mean, she'll sit down with the guitar and the licks just come and the words fly right out of her mouth. I'm not kiddin' you,\" a member of her band said. \"She just sits down and writes them. There's no tellin' how many she'll write once she starts -- ten or twenty, maybe. And when she gets in that writing mood, forget about talkin' to her, because she's mesmerized. You ask her a question and she don't know what you're sayin', she's so into her writing.\"\n\nHer designer, Lucy Adams, agreed.\n\n\"I have been to Dolly's house when she was writing and I don't think she would really know I was there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't mind it because I knew what it was. When she's writing, she's living what she does. If she writes a happy song, she's happy. If she writes a sad song, that's the sad part of her.\"\n\nWhile Parton once wrote 20 songs in a day, a different writing session may beat this achievement. In 1972, Parton sat down and wrote two of her biggest hits on the same day.\n\n\"In 1972, I wrote ['I Will Always Love You'],\" she said on The Bobby Bones Show. \"At the same time, I wrote 'Jolene.' That was a good writing day.\"", "source": {"uri": "cheatsheet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_mckee@cheatsheet.com", "name": "Emma McKee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dolly Parton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_recorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tape recorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanna_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alanna Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bobby_Bones_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bobby Bones Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolene_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jolene (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Will_Always_Love_You", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "I Will Always Love You"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guitar"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Young_Writers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Young Writers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Writing_Exercises", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Writing Exercises", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Book_Writing", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Book Writing", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Dolly-Parton-4.jpg?w=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630797", "eventUri": "eng-9630797", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

The bar served elaborate, goofy cocktails with over-the-top touches, like coffee drinks served with mallets to crush tuiles the glass, or Hennessy daiquiris with flashing LED \"ice cubes.\"\n\nFor the venue's next act, Sesame Collective is going far simpler -- and, in the words of owner Kasey Mills, \"more timeless.\" Bar Dolly, taking over the former Icarus space this July, will be an extension of the restaurant group's successful Italian restaurant next door, Dolly Olive, with a broader, more Mediterranean wine list and a range of classic cocktails and spritzes.\n\nJoanna Scarpelli, the Sesame Collective beverage director, generally focuses exclusively on Italian wines at Dolly Olive, with a few exceptions. At Bar Dolly, Scarpelli is broadening her lens, including bottles from wine regions in Greece, France, and Spain, leaning on the \"affordable and approachable,\" in her words. \"(The wine list is) eclectic, it's compelling, but it has a little bit for everyone,\" she says.\n\nThe bar will be similarly generalist in approach, with a bit of an Italian lilt. A menu of spritzes will include classics like Aperol spritzes and Biciclettas, as well as ones made with lambrusco and house-made limoncello. The house Negroni gets its acidic touch from cranberry grenadine, served in an individual capped bottle for tableside pours, while the hazelnut whiskey sour's nuttiness comes from a Frangelico cordial. The margaritas are bolstered with Montenegro. As is true of most Sesame Collective restaurants, Bar Dolly will offer a range of nonalcoholic drinks, including Pathfinder spritzes, tarragon highballs, and Phony Negronis.\n\nBar Dolly will share a food menu with its sibling, featuring most of the items from the menu that travel well, according to Mills. Originally, Icarus had its own menu of pizzas that came from the Dolly Olive kitchen; while Bar Dolly may have the occasional special, like salami and cheese boards, the idea is to simplify things for chef Casey Brigan and Sesame Collective culinary director Natalie Gullish. \"Trying to run two kitchens out of the one kitchen was a challenge,\" Mills says. \"The goal is to be able to offer a pretty similar experience of what you could get at Dolly [Olive] at Bar Dolly.\"\n\nThe team has already begun the redesign of the space, which will abandon the Italo Disco trappings of Icarus in favor of a cleaner, sleeker aesthetic, with plenty of walnut wood touches \"to bring back that more classic feel,\" Mills says. Bar Dolly will have about 30 seats with table service. That way, Bar Dolly can behave like a restaurant for those hoping to grab a quick dinner before a show downtown or a bar for those hoping to grab a glass of wine after work -- Bar Dolly can even serve as a bottle shop, as well, selling the bottle list to-go to fill the void left by Park Avenue Fine Wines. \"Expect the same level of refined service,\" Sesame Collective partner Laura Amans says, \"but it'll likely be a more casual experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "pdx.eater.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eater Portland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooke_jackson_glidden@pdx.eater.com", "name": "Brooke Jackson-Glidden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icarus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Icarus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cocktail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daiquiri", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daiquiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ice cube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_cuisine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italian cuisine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portland, Oregon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenadine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grenadine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroni", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Negroni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_sour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whiskey sour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frangelico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frangelico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclecticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eclecticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazelnut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hazelnut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Margarita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aperol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limoncello", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Limoncello"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cranberry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montenegro", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montenegro"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Montenegro"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality", "label": "dmoz/Business/Hospitality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Beverages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Kitchen_and_Dining", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Kitchen and Dining", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Bar_Billiards", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Bar Billiards", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdOzBzpAtxh0U3qJlFJ1ZkbyMwc=/0x355:1080x895/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25477963/Joanna.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630797", "eventUri": "eng-9630797", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 89, "relevance": 1}

You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll clap, you'll stomp, it truly is a Grand Ol' Opera. Pun and fun intended,\" she said in a statement.\n\nParton will team up with Maria S. Schlatte on the story. Schlatte won an Emmy for producing Netflix's \"Christmas on the Square,\" which starred Christine Baranski.\n\n\"Hello, I'm Dolly\" is the name of Parton's debut album released in 1967, which had the songs ''Dumb Blonde'' and \"Something Fishy.''\n\nParton went on to become a national treasure, starring in movies, writing books, earning Grammys, becoming the first country artist to be named MusiCares Person of the Year, and donating $1 million for research into the coronavirus.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith 52 Grammy nominations and 11 wins, she is the second-most nominated woman in Grammy history, only behind Beyonc\u00e9, who has 79 nods and 24 wins.

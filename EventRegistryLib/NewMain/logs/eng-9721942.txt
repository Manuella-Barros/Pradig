He introduced me to someone who managed Michael Jackson. I tested the waters and asked, 'Can I meet Michael Jackson?' He said he would send an email. After a week with no response, I thought, 'It's fine.'\"\n\nRahman went on to explain that as nominations for the Oscars began to come in for 'Slumdog Millionaire,' he finally received a reply that Michael Jackson was interested in meeting him. Rahman, however, responded, \"I don't want to meet him now. I'll meet him when I've won an Oscar.\" His confidence proved right, and after winning the coveted award, Rahman visited Jackson the next day. The two spent hours conversing and bonding over music and world peace.\n\nThe 'Roja' music composer added that Jackson praised his work in 'Slumdog Millionaire' and asked him technical questions. Rahman appreciated Jackson's warm nature, noting, \"He introduced me to his kids, but I was jet-lagged from working day and night. I was eager to return to India... It was unforgettable.\" Upon returning, Rahman shared his experience with director Shankar, suggesting they collaborate with Jackson for a song in the film 'Enthiran' (Robot), starring Rajnikanth and Aishwarya Rai.\n\nWhen Rahman presented the idea to Jackson, the response was enthusiastic: 'Whatever you say, we will do it together.' Unfortunately, the collaboration never materialized as Jackson passed away later that year due to illness.\n\nAR Rahman, known for delivering numerous hits and memorable music over the years, boasts a commendable discography including popular films such as 'Roja,' 'Bombay,' 'Taal,' and 'Guru,' among others.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthiran_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enthiran (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

Apart from this, Rahman also said that he had initially refused to meet the international singer-dancer.\n\nAR Rahman met Michael Jackson after winning big at the Oscars in 2009 for 'Slumdog Millionaire'.

I was waiting to return to India. It was unforgettable,\" he said.\n\nRahman said that upon returning to India, he began working on Rajinikanth's 'Enthiran'. Which is when, director Shankar asked why he hadn't collaborated with Jackson on a song. \"I said, 'Wow, will he do a Tamil song?' And I called him, and we spoke that week.

I felt (on) top of the world.\" FYI: AR Rahman won two Oscars in 2009 in Best Original Score and Best Original Song categories for Jai Ho, from the film Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nAR Rahman described Michael Jackson as \"kind.\" He said, \"It was a nice time to meet him. He was very kind. He said, 'Oh, I love the songs, what chords you programmed.' He was talking about world peace and 'Why don't we do the next We Are The World?' he kept asking.\"\n\nAR Rahman continued, \"So all that happened. (Michael Jackson) introduced me to his kids. And I was jet-lagged, working day and night. I was waiting to go to India. So we had two hours. And he told me, 'When I dance, I dance with my heart.'...It was unforgettable.\"\n\nAR Rahman also mentioned that after returning to India, he had an interaction with Michael Jackson, and the duo was planning to collaborate on a song. Unfortunately, that could not happen as Michael Jackson died in 2009.\n\nPromoted\n\nListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com", "source": {"uri": "ndtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NDTV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

AR Rahman has been associated with several leading stars, and he has been rocking through his movies for over 30 years. AR Rahman went to Malaysia for a short promotional tour, and he interacted with fans during the tour to share a big secret. In 2009, AR Rahman met a friend who was also a friend of Michael Jackson, and the former expressed his wish to meet the pop singer, but the latter didn't accept his invitation.Michael Jackson later invited AR Raham for a meeting when the Indian composer was nominated for the Oscars. But AR Rahman denied the offer at that time, and he decided to meet the pop singer only after winning the Oscar.\n\nAR Rahman then bagged the Oscar award for Slum Dog Millionaire as he expected, and he went on to meet Michael Jackson at the latter's house. AR Rahman got excited after seeing Michael Jackson's entry, and he had a memorable interaction with the singer. Michael Jackson expressed his interest in associating with AR Rahman during the meeting. AR Rahman then figured out a plan of roping in Michael Jackson to sing a song in 'Enthiran' since he was busy with the music of Rajinikanth and Shankar's film at that time. When AR Rahman finalized his plan for Michael Jackson to sing a Tamil song for Shankar's directorial 'Enthiran', the popular singer died unfortunately due to illness, and it made the composer drop his plan.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

An email was sent out but there was no response for a week. Then, I got nominated for the Oscars (for Jai Ho from Slumdog Millionaire). Michael's team said he wanted to meet me. I said, I don't want to meet him now. I'll meet him when I've won an Oscar,\" said Rahman.\n\nWhen he did win the Oscar, he explained the feeling as 'top of the world'. \"I met him at a home in LA the day after I won it. He was very kind, we spoke about music and world peace. He said, why don't we do the next We Are The World, introduced me to his kids. He even showed me how he dances from the heart,\" Rahman said.\n\nRahman eventually came back to India and told filmmaker Shankar about his meeting Micheal. Shankar asked the composer if the pop legend would sing for Enthiran.\n\n\"Shankar sir asked me if he would sing for the film. I said, wow, will he sing a Tamil song? I asked. He said, whatever you say, we'll do it together.\n\nThe plan never materialised as Michael died in June of that year. \"He was sick at that time,\" said Rahman.\n\nThe OST of Enthiran featured no international singers, but it went on to be a massive success. The sequel of the film 2.0, featured music by Rahman as well and was released in 2018. The film featured Rajinikanth, Akshay Kumar and Amy Jackson.\n\nShankar on Rahman's absence in Indian 2\n\nShankar and Rahman have worked on numerous projects together, including the 1996 Kamal Haasan-starrer Indian. The sequel, Indian 2, however, features music by Anirudh Ravichander. When asked about it at a recent press meeting, Shankar said that he approached Anirudh because Rahman was busy.\n\n\"When we started work on Indian 2, AR Rahman was already working on the BGM of 2.0 and I needed the songs soon. I didn't want to overburden him with Indian 2 and I also liked Anirudh's music.

There was no response in the first week. I was just quiet, and I said, 'It's fine'.\"\n\n\"And then the nominations happened, and I got nominated for the Oscars. Then, the email came in, and it said, 'Michael wants to meet you'. But I said, 'I don't want to meet him now',\" Rahman added. As the audience rooted for him, Rahman said, \"I said, 'I don't want to meet him. If I win an Oscar, I'll meet him, otherwise I won't'. I was sure I was going to win. I won, and the next day, I went to meet him. It was almost 6:30 pm, and the sun was going down. And then, somebody opened the door with gloves on...\"\n\nRahman later also shared what he spoke about during the meeting. He told his fans that Jackson talked about 'world peace', and his moves. Jackson also told Rahman that he was in love with his music in Slumdog Millionaire. \"He introduced me to his kids, but I was jet-lagged because I'd been working day and night. I was waiting to return to India... It was unforgettable,\" he said.\n\nAfter returning to India, Rahman immersed himself in composing for the Rajinikanth-starrer film Enthiran. During this period, director Shankar questioned why Rahman hadn't collaborated with Michael Jackson on a song. Reflecting on this suggestion, Rahman recalled his initial surprise: \"I said, 'Wow, will he do a Tamil song?' And I called him, and we spoke that week. He said, 'Whatever you say, we will do it together'. We met again, but unfortunately, he passed away in 2009. He was sick at the time.\"", "source": {"uri": "screenbox.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenBox"}, "authors": [{"uri": "komal_das@screenbox.in", "name": "Komal Das", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._R._Rahman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.

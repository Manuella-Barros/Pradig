The World Anti-Doping Agency reportedly declined to take action, even though it appears its own rules should have prohibited those swimmers from competing.\n\nIn an interview with correspondent Elaine Quijano to be broadcast on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" and streamed on Paramount+ June 2, Ledecky said, \"In this instance, it doesn't seem like everything was followed to a T. So, I'd like to see some accountability here. I'd like to see some answers as to why this happened the way it did. And I'd really like to see that steps are taken for the future so that we can regain some confidence in the global system.\"\n\nAsked whether she believes the results of the 2021 Games need to be reexamined or rescinded, Ledecky replied, \"I mean, I think the whole case has to be reexamined independently and thoroughly and all the information needs to be out there.\"\n\nLedecky (whose new book, \"Just Add Water: My Swimming Life,\" will be published June 11) won her first Olympic gold at age 15, and has earned seven gold and three silver medals, from the London, Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo Games.

champion Katie Ledecky says faith in anti-doping measures \"is at an all-time low\" after global officials allowed doping-positive Chinese swimmers to compete at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe 27-year-old American, whose Olympic and 21 world championship gold medals are the most by any female swimmer, spoke to CBS News for an interview to be broadcast on Sunday as she prepares for next month's US Olympic Trials and the Paris Olympics in July.\n\n\"It's hard going to Paris knowing that we're going to be racing some of these athletes,\" Ledecky said, according to the CBS News website.\n\n\"And I think our faith in some of the systems is at an all-time low.\"\n\nIn April, the New York Times reported 23 Chinese swimmers, two of whom competed against Ledecky and her US teammates in Tokyo, had tested positive for a banned substance only seven months before the Covid-delayed 2021 Games in Japan.\n\nChinese officials said the athletes ate contaminated food and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) took no action, saying it could not disprove the possibility and that no appeal would be warranted.\n\n\"I think the whole case has to be re-examined independently and thoroughly and all the information needs to be out there,\" Ledecky said.\n\n\"In this instance, it doesn't seem like everything was followed to a T so I'd like to see some accountability here.\n\n\"I would like to see some answers as to why this happened the way it did and I would really like to see that steps are taken for the future so that we can regain some confidence in the global system.\"\n\nLedecky, who has a book coming out in June, has captured seven gold medals and three silver medals combined at the London, Rio and Tokyo Olympics.\n\nLedecky said she tries not to consider that she might not be on a level field when it comes to other swimmers when he hits the water.\n\n\"You try not to think too much about (it) when you're actually racing and the best thing to do is to just go out there and try and win,\" she said.\n\n\"It's tough when you have in the back of your head that it's not necessarily an even playing field.\"", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL

Two of those swimmers actually competed against Ledecky in the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"It's hard going into Paris knowing that we're gonna be racing some of these athletes,\" Ledecky told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in an interview that will air on June 2. \"And I think our faith in some of the systems is at an all-time low. You try not to think too much about when you're actually racing. And the best thing to do is to just go out there and try to win.\n\n\"It's tough when you have in the back of your head that it's not necessarily an even playing field.\"\n\nChinese officials stated that the swimmers ate contaminated food that contributed to the positive test. However, the World Anti-Doping Agency reportedly wasn't willing to impose an type of penalty for the positive drug tests.\n\n\"In this instance, it doesn't seem like everything was followed to a T.

In an interview with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" that will air Sunday, Ledecky expressed concern that she and many others won't be competing on a level playing field at what could be her fourth Olympics in France.\n\n\"It's hard going into Paris knowing that we're going to be racing some of these athletes,\" said Ledecky, who will be at U.S. Olympic trials starting June 15. \"And I think our faith in some of the systems is at an all-time low.\"\n\nAmong Ledecky's medals in Tokyo three years ago was a silver from the 4x200-meter freestyle relay that China won. Last month, the New York Times and German broadcaster ARD reported that 23 Chinese swimmers tested positive for a performance-enhancing drug in the months leading up to those Olympics, where some of the Chinese swimmers who tested positive were allowed to compete.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The World Anti-Doping Agency accepted that explanation, saying in part that it had very little chance of winning an appeal had it opened a case.\n\nLedecky, whose six individual Olympic golds is a women's record, said \"it doesn't seem like everything was followed to a 'T'\" regarding the handling of the case.\n\n\"I'd like to see some accountability here,\" she said. \"I'd like to see some answers as to why this happened the way it did. And I'd really like to see that steps are taken for the future so that we can regain some confidence in the global system.\"\n\nWADA hired a Swiss lawyer to conduct a review of the way the case was handled, but critics have said the probe is too narrow and not truly independent. Ledecky added to a chorus of athletes who would like to see more transparency about the case that figures to cast a shadow over swimming in Paris.\n\n\"I think the whole case has to be reexamined independently and thoroughly,\" she said, \"and all the information needs to be out there.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news

Schmidt and Tariq Panja of the New York Times broke news on the matter in April:\n\n\"Twenty-three top Chinese swimmers tested positive for the same powerful banned substance seven months before the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021 but were allowed to escape public scrutiny and continue to compete after top Chinese officials secretly cleared them of doping and the global authority charged with policing drugs in sports chose not to intervene.\n\n\"Several of the athletes who tested positive -- including nearly half of the swimming team that China sent to the Tokyo Games -- went on to win medals, including three golds. Many still compete for China and several, including the two-time gold medalist Zhang Yufei, are expected to contend for medals again at this year's Summer Games in Paris.\"\n\nThe NYT relayed that Chinada, the Chinese anti-doping agency, suggested the positive tests came from a \"tainted food supply,\" and the NYT added that it's \"a finding that some experts considered implausible.\"\n\nPer the AP, Chinese authorities did not punish the athletes. The World Anti-Doping Agency stated in a Fact Sheet/FAQ on the matter that \"the feedback from WADA's Science Department was ultimately that the contamination scenario was plausible and that there was no concrete scientific element to challenge it.\"", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_kasabian@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Paul Kasabian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Katie Ledecky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimetazidine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trimetazidine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News_Sunday_Morning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News Sunday Morning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Yufei_(swimmer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zhang Yufei (swimmer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Anti-Doping Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1717176086/kmvwzm4tahjkalngibae.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615094", "eventUri": "eng-9615094", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

As 6ft 7in Hill left his seat after the final whistle \u2013 Sale lost 31-23 \u2013 and walked down the stairs, he became involved with the man. The Bath supporter, who did want to be named, told reporters: \u201cI was sat there and he came down the stairs, grabbed me around the throat, broke my sunglasses and cut the top of my eye. \u201cHe was like saying to me \u2018don\u2019t ever do that again\u2019. \u201cTo be honest, all I want is a new pair of sunglasses. I don\u2019t want to make a big thing. \u201cI was sat with my partner and all her family. This is not football.\u201d In a statement, Sale said: \u201cSale Sharks are aware of an incident involving a player and Bath Rugby fan at the final whistle of today\u2019s semi-final. \u201cThe club will work with Bath Rugby to complete an investigation into the incident and will provide no further comment at this time.\u201d Asked about the incident in his post-match press conference, Sale rugby director Alex Sanderson said: \u201cIt is news to me. \u201cJonny is not the aggressive type and I will answer those questions when I know. \u201cI can vouch for Jonny\u2019s character. He is not an overly aggressive spiteful person.\u201d", "summary": "<p>A 28-year-old man has claimed he was grabbed around the throat and left with a cut above his eye after an incident involving Sale Sharks\u2019 England forward Jonny Hill following Bath\u2019s Gallagher Premiership play-off victory.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/sport/rugby/he-grabbed-me-by-the-throat-england-star-under-investigation-over-incident-with-fan-after-premiership-semi-final/a127800903.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/RtcIfNbuofeYITgcI257jyhRFD0=/341x0:5208x3244/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/fb27efcc-05ac-45b6-a6c0-5f30e3933bb2/fb98f691-112c-4d5a-86c0-80d9e836dc35/fb27efcc-05ac-45b6-a6c0-5f30e3933bb2.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:06:31", "author": "Andrew Baldock", "authors": ["Andrew Baldock"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.369}

Will INDIA Bloc Attend Narendra Modi's Swearing-in Ceremony? New Delhi: Jairam Ramesh, a Congress leader, stated on Saturday that invitations for Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi\u2019s swearing-in ceremony, slated for Sunday, June 9th, at the Rashtrapati Bhavan, hadn\u2019t yet reached party leaders. \u201cOnly international leaders have been invited for the swearing-in ceremony. Our leaders have not received the invitation yet. When our INDIA alliance leaders receive the invitation, we will think about it,\u201d Jairam Ramesh said, according to ANI. Jairam Ramesh Mocks Narendra ModiMocking Prime Minister designate Narendra Modi over the results of the Lok Sabha polls, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh on Saturday said that \u201cdrumbeaters\u201d are justifying PM Modi\u2019s \u201cpathetic\u201d electoral performance unnecessarily. In a post on X, Congress General Secretary (Communications) Jairam Ramesh said, \u201cThe drumbeat to find silver linings in the mandate that has been a moral, political, and personal defeat for Narendra Modi has started. It is being propagated that Mr. Narendra Modi is the first to receive a mandate three times in a row after Jawaharlal Nehru. How leading a party to 240 seats and becoming an ek-tihaaii Pradhan Mantri is a mandate is not explained.\u201d He further stated that former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru remained a complete democrat even after receiving a two-thirds majority in Parliament three times. \u201cNehru, on the other hand, got 364 seats in 1952, 371 seats in 1957, and 361 seats in 1962 \u2013 a 2/3rd majority each time. Yet he remained a complete democrat, nurturing Parliament so very carefully with his constant presence Neither is Modi the only man since Nehru to be sworn in thrice \u2013 in a row or not. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was sworn in thrice in 1996, 1998 and 1999. And Indira Gandhi was sworn in 4 times in 1966, 1967, 1971 and 1980. The drumbeaters will look for anything to justify Mr Narendra Modi\u2019s pathetic electoral performance in 2024,\u201d he said.

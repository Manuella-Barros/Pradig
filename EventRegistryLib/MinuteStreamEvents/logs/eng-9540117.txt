But many of the gang members were once the police officers whom we helped to train.\n\nJimmy \"Barbeque\" Cherizier, the leader of the G9 gang which controls the streets and is the most powerful man in Haiti, was a former police officer who had been accused of playing a role in the murder, rape and arsons that burned 400 homes and killed 70 people.\n\nSo, it's time for more \"military assistance\".\n\nThe Biden administration has approved a $60 million military aid package to help Haiti quell violent gangs wreaking havoc in the country, according to documents obtained by POLITICO.\n\nThe package, the second the U.S. has approved for the Haiti crisis this year, includes mostly small arms but also some armored vehicles.

Although Haiti being the first Caribbean black republic to have claimed independence from France due to a 13-year-long Haitian revolution on the January 1, 1804, it has visibly lost direction.\n\nOnce a nation idolised by leaders and nations as an aspiring republic, a nation destined to progress extensively under the leadership of its pioneers and forefathers. It was a glaring beacon of abolition, self determination and racial equality. Amongst several reasons, the social and economic development of the country is jeopardized by governance issues and fragility. According to the latest World Bank reports, Haiti ranks 163 out of 191 countries on the Human Development Index. Consequently, once considered a jewel, now the poorest country in the Caribbean and Latin America. The economy has contracted for four consecutive years. Further, current estimates suggest the poverty rate stands at 87 per cent.\n\nWho would have ever conceived the notion that Haiti would have met such a fate when founded in the hardest of circumstances? The baffling circumstances in Haiti require extraordinary leadership and collaborative efforts as Haiti has failed to circumvent its persistent nuisances. There is a discernible need to reassign the UN stabilisation mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) working in tandem with Brazilian forces. This yielded astounding success in addressing the persistent onslaught of its people and resources despite its shortcomings.\n\nIn Michael Dziedzic and Robert M. Perito's report, titled Haiti Confronting the Gangs of Port-au-Prince The United States Institute of Peace survey stated that '' 67 per cent of those polled credited the UN mission for the improvement in their security situation.'' Further, ''the US State Department's Haiti Stabilization Initiative (HSI) in November 2007, found that 98 per cent of the residents of Cit\u00e9 Soleil , the epicentre of Haiti's gang war, felt safer than they had six months earlier, and 85 per cent reported that they could conduct their daily activities, without fear of intimidation or extortion.\n\nKidnappings have dropped below 20 per cent of their previous levels. Sentiment towards MINUSTAH has improved dramatically as a result of the crackdown on gangs.'' Despite attempts by other multinational forces, Brazilian military forces truly transformed the criminal landscape in Haiti during its mission. ''A report co-published by the Brazilian Armed Forces in 2017 stated that MINUSTAH had become \"a global reference\" for peacekeeping missions. Former force commander, Floriano Peixoto wrote that Brazil's 13-year military presence in Haiti could be, \"without a doubt, considered a very successful epic.\" It is hoped that President Lula will reconsider his stance on Haiti once the UN revises policies surrounding controversial issues of the past which terribly dampen their impetus to recommence its operations in Haiti. Critically, the onus lies on Haitians to radically alter their mindset so as not remain a ''caged bird'' within illusionary bars.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news",

This commemoration is not just about reflecting on the past; it's a call to action for the sons and daughters of the global Black world and beyond, to engage with and support Haiti in a meaningful way.\n\nThe Indelible Legacy of Haiti Haiti's historical significance cannot be overstated. In 1804, Haiti shattered the chains of colonialism, becoming the first nation to permanently abolish slavery and the first post-colonial independent Blackled nation in the world. This monumental achievement was a source of inspiration for countless enslaved and oppressed people worldwide, underpinning the idea that freedom was attainable.\n\nToday, despite grappling with political instability and economic challenges, Haiti's spirit of resistance and resilience remains unbroken. The nation's vibrant culture, profound historical contributions, and ongoing struggles for justice continue to influence and resonate deeply within the diaspora and among global allies. How the World Can Support Haiti As we honor Haiti's heritage, it is also essential to engage actively in supporting its path to stability and prosperity. Here's how the global community, particularly the global Black diaspora, can contribute:\n\n1. Educational Exchange and Support: o Foster partnerships with Haitian educational institutions to enhance educational opportunities and resources. o Offer scholarships and fellowships to Haitian students in areas critical to the nation's development such as agriculture, technology, and health.\n\n2. Investment in Sustainable Development: o Encourage diaspora and global investment in sustainable business practices that benefit local communities and ecosystems. o Support local Haitian entrepreneurs through microfinance initiatives and business development programs.\n\n3. Cultural Exchange and Tourism: o Promote responsible tourism that respects local culture and invests in local communities. o Engage in cultural exchange programs that allow for a deeper understanding of Haiti's rich heritage and contemporary arts.\n\n4. Advocacy and Political Support: o Use your voice to advocate for policies that support stability and prosperity in Haiti. o Engage in dialogue with policymakers to promote fair trade practices and aid transparency.\n\n5. Direct Aid and Donations: o Contribute to reputable nonprofits that are working on the ground in Haiti to address urgent needs like healthcare, education, and food security. o Support disaster relief efforts in times of crisis, ensuring aid is timely and reaches those in need.\n\nA Call to Action: No Haiti, No Liberty!\n\nLet this Haitian Heritage Month be a reminder of the profound debt of gratitude we owe to Haiti for showing the world the path to liberty. \"No Haiti, No Liberty!\" -- this rallying cry should galvanize us all to action. As descendants and beneficiaries of Haiti's courage, it is our duty to support and uplift this great nation through our collective efforts.\n\nIn doing so, we honor not only the indomitable spirit of the Haitian people but also the very essence of freedom and human dignity that Haiti has come to symbolize in our shared history. Let us stand in solidarity with Haiti, not just in celebration, but through proactive support and commitment to her future. This Heritage Month, let's renew our commitment to Haiti -- a commitment to support, advocate, and cherish the first Black Republic whose legacy is the cornerstone of freedom in the modern world.", "source": {"uri": "sfltimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Florida Times: Miami , Broward, Palm Beach, Breaking News & Weather at SFLTimes.com - Home"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Heritage_Month", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haitian Heritage Month"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abolitionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Postcolonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonialism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Direct action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "African diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfinance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microfinance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Failed state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haitians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fair trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Multi-Issue", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Globalization", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "http://www.sfltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/6.22.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540117", "eventUri": "eng-9540117", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The first quarter of 2024 has been the most violent since BINUH began to record statistics in 2022. More than 2,500 people have been killed or injured as a result of gang violence with the majority of the violence occurring in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince. The situation is worsening, with hundreds of thousands already internally displaced due to gang activity. Despite this, countries continue to deport migrants back into Haiti where the two main gangs have launched coordinated attacks that have targeted key state infrastructure, including police stations, prisons, and the Presidential Palace.\n\nAmnesty International describes the circumstances in Haiti as a \"grave crisis\" and \"urges the international community to address the situation in the country from a human rights perspective\". Mar\u00eda Isabel, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Haiti and Head of BINUH, briefed the UNSC last week, explaining that the establishment of a Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) will \"pave the way towards democratic stability\" but that \"high attention must also be paid to the thousands of displaced people, including women and children, victims of gang violence, requiring humanitarian support\". Isabel points out that the Humanitarian Response Plan for Haiti is not completely funded, and urges UN Member States to continue to fund the Plan.\n\nThe report from the BINUH underscores a dire situation in the country, with a staggering increase in deaths and injuries from gang violence already this year. Amnesty International and other human rights organizations are correct in labeling the crisis, as there is an urgent need for a human rights-centered response from the international community. Addressing root causes of this violence is also essential for fostering lasting peace and stability in Haiti. The establishment of the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) is a positive step towards progress, but its success hinges on robust international support and a holistic approach that addresses both immediate security concerns and underlying challenges.\n\nHaiti's President Jovenel Mo\u00efse was assassinated in 2021 after demands for his resignation grew rampant due to economic and political turmoil. Ariel Henry was appointed as President amid this political crisis in 2021, though conditions did not improve. As a result of natural disasters and the economic situation, gang violence in Haiti increased rapidly. Since January 2023, Haiti has had no national elected officials and anti-government sentiments have only grown.

What would it mean to tell a new story?\" Read the full article, with photos by Josu\u00e9 Azor, at The New Yorker.\n\nI often receive condolence-type calls, e-mails, and texts about Haiti. Many of these messages are in response to the increasingly dire news in the press, some of which echoes what many of us in the global Haitian diaspora hear from our family and friends. More than fifteen hundred Haitians were killed during the first three months of this year, according to a recent United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights report, which described the country's situation as \"cataclysmic.\" Women and girls are routinely subjected to sexual violence. Access to food, water, education, and health care is becoming more limited, with more than four million Haitians, around a third of the population, living with food insecurity, and 1.4 million near starvation. Armed criminal groups have taken over entire neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince and the surrounding areas, carrying out mass prison breaks and attacks on the city's airport, seaport, government buildings, police stations, schools, churches, hospitals, pharmacies, and banks, turning the capital into an \"open air prison.\"\n\nEven those who know the country's long and complex history will ask, \"Why can't Haiti catch a break?\" We then revisit some abridged version of that history. In 1804, after a twelve-year revolution against French colonial rule, Haiti won its independence, which the United States and several European powers failed to recognize for decades. The world's first Black republic was then forced to spend sixty years paying a hundred-and-fifty-million francs (now worth close to thirty billion dollars) indemnity to France. Americans invaded and then occupied Haiti for nineteen years at the beginning of the twentieth century. The country endured twenty-nine years of murderous dictatorship under Fran\u00e7ois Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, until 1986. In 1991, a few months after Haiti's first democratically elected President, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, took office, he was overthrown in a coup staged by a military whose members had been trained in the U.S. Aristide was elected again, then overthrown again, in 2004, in part owing to an armed rebellion led by Guy Philippe, who was later arrested by the U.S. government for money laundering related to drug trafficking. Last November, six years into his nine-year prison sentence, Philippe was deported by the U.S. to Haiti. He immediately aligned himself with armed groups and has now put himself forward as a Presidential candidate.\n\nIn 2010, the country was devastated by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake, which killed more than two hundred thousand people. Soon after, United Nations \"peacekeepers\" dumped feces in Haiti's longest river, causing a cholera epidemic that killed more than ten thousand people and infected close to a million. For the past thirteen years, Haiti has been decimated by its ruling party, Parti Ha\u00eftien T\u00e8t Kale (P.H.T.K.), which rose to power after a highly contested election in 2011. In that election, the U.S. -- then represented by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton -- and the Organization of American States helped the candidate who finished in third place, Michel Martelly, claim the top spot. Bankrolled by kidnapping, drug trafficking, business \u00e9lites, and politicians, armed groups have multiplied under P.H.T.K, committing massacres that have been labelled crimes against humanity. In 2021, a marginally elected President, Jovenel Mo\u00efse, was assassinated in his bedroom, a crime for which many of those closest to him, including his wife, have been named as either accomplices or suspects.\n\nThe unasked question remains, as W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in \"The Souls of Black Folk,\" \"How does it feel to be a problem?\"\n\nI deeply honor Haiti's spirit of resistance and long history of struggle, but I must admit that sometimes the answer to that question is that it hurts. Sometimes it hurts a lot, even when one is aware of the causes, including the fact that the weapons that have allowed gangs to take over the capital continue to flow freely from Miami and the Dominican Republic, despite a U.N. embargo. Internally, the poorest Haitians have been constantly thwarted by an unequal and stratified society, which labels rural people moun andey\u00f2 (outside people), and which is suffused with greedy and corrupt politicians and oligarchs who scorn the masses from whose tribulations they extract their wealth. [. . .]\n\nLately, some of our family gatherings are incantations of grief. But they can also turn into storytelling sessions of a different kind. They are opportunities for our elders to share something about Haiti beyond what our young ones, like everyone else, see on the news. The headlines bleed into their lives, too, as do the recycled tropes that paint us as ungovernable, failures, thugs, and even cannibals. As with the prayers that we recite over the dead, words still have power, the elders whisper. We must not keep repeating the worst, they say, and in their voices I hear an extra layer of distress. They fear that they may never see Haiti again. They fear that those in the next generation, some of whom have never been to Haiti, will let Haiti slip away, as though the country they see in the media -- the trash-strewn streets and the barricades made from the shells of burnt cars, the young men brandishing weapons of war and the regular citizens using machetes to defend themselves -- were part of some horror film that they can easily turn off. The elders remind us that we have been removed, at least physically, from all of this by only a single generation, if not less.\n\nWe are still human beings, the elders insist -- \"Se moun nou ye.\" We are still wozo, like that irrepressible reed that grows all over Haiti. For a brief moment, I think someone might break into the Haitian national anthem or sing a few bars of the folk song \"Ayiti Cheri.\" (\"Beloved Haiti, I had to leave you to understand.\") Instead, they hum the music that the wozo has inspired: \"Nou se wozo / Menm si nou pliye, nou pap kase.\" Even if we bend, we will not break.

In addition, USAID's \"Haiti Electoral Security and Support Program\" threatens to allow Washington to, once again, skew the results of Haiti's elections.\n\nAfter calling an emergency meeting in Kingston, Jamaica on Mar. 11 to concoct a way to fill the void left by former Prime Minister Ariel Henry's unexpected ouster, Washington finally swore in its nine-member \"Temporary Presidential Council\" (TPC) on Apr. 25, although the ceremony had to be done secretly at the National Palace due to the body's unpopularity.\n\nTransitional Presidential Council Takes Charge in Haiti\n\nThe TPC would be installed at the Villa d'Accueil, caretaker authorities had said earlier last week, claiming that a delegation of Leslie Voltaire, Himmler R\u00e9bu, and Raymond Jeanty deemed the area around the Palace too dangerous. Since Feb. 29, it has been the target of many attacks from soldiers of the Viv Ansanm (Live Together) coalition of armed neighborhood committees, drawn from all around greater Port-au-Prince.\n\nThe TPC is unpopular because its nine members (seven voting, two observers) are viewed by most Haitians as sell-outs. To sit on the council, they had to agree to the third foreign military intervention into Haiti in three decades (the first two were 1994-2000 and then 2004-2019).\n\nThe proxy force that Washington wants to see occupy Haiti is called the Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS), to be led by Kenyan police with the assistance of armed forces from six other nations: Benin, Chad, Jamaica, Barbados, Bahamas, and Bangladesh. It is not under the aegis of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nOn Apr. 30, the TPC named a new President - Edgar Leblanc Fils, leader of the Struggling People's Organization (OPL) and the Jan. 30 Collective, who holds one of the TPC's seven voting seats - and Prime Minister - Fritz B\u00e9lizaire, a former Minister of Sports under President Ren\u00e9 Pr\u00e9val.\n\nThe idea now is for the TPC and its designated President and Prime Minister (the names will surely change before long) to carry out an election - Haiti's first in eight years - under Washington's watchful eye and the MSS's muscled protection.\n\nUsing the soft-power and hard-power forces outlined in this series' first two articles, Washington seeks to ensure the election of a new Haitian president who will quickly sign on the dotted line of a deal called the Global Fragility Act (GFA), which would essentially place Haiti back into colonial status with U.S. troops stationed in a nation made dependent on USAID humanitarian assistance shipments.\n\nIn 1915, U.S. Marines invaded Haiti for the first time, installing a puppet president, Sudr\u00e9 Dartiguenave, who invited them to stay on. Washington is going to great lengths to avoid repeating the terrible optics of its early 20 century's \"gunboat diplomacy.'\n\nThis time it is making sure to use the MSS proxy force to install a U.S. puppet which will then invite in U.S. troops under the GFA.\n\nThe GFA will build Haiti's \"stability and autonomy\"\n\nDuring a recent panel discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols explained that Washington has \"a long term strategy for Haiti under the Global Fragility Act that has a ten year plan to support Haiti's increased stability and autonomy.\" The \"autonomy\" Nichols hopes to foster is from China, to whose Belt and Road Initiative the GFA is a counter-measure.\n\nThe GFA was passed under President Trump in 2019 with full bipartisan support. Washington's first \"partner\" under the GFA is Haiti.\n\nThe GFA emphasizes building relationships with \"local civil society\" by \"strengthen[ing] the capacity of the United States to be an effective leader of international efforts to prevent extremism and violent conflict.\"\n\nThis \"capacity\" includes negotiating 10-year \"security assistance\" agreements with \"partner\" nations.\n\nThe GFA aims to prevent \"fragile states\" from developing diplomatic and trade relationships with Russia and China. This adversarial stance on Russia and China results from their rapprochement with \"fragile states\" which involves geo-strategic concerns, including access to raw materials.\n\nHaiti is often the laboratory where Washington tests its new imperialist strategies for maintaining hegemony.\n\nA \"partnership\" under the GFA between Haiti and Washington would ensure that Haiti remains under U.S. hegemony for decades. This would also block diplomacy and investment from countries like China.\n\nIn 2017, China offered to overhaul Port-au-Prince's crumbling infrastructure with a $4.7 billion aid package. In return, Haiti would drop its recognition of Taiwan as the \"Republic of China.\" Haiti remains one of only 11 nations (not counting the Vatican) which recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. The planet's other 182 nations recognize only the People's Republic of China.\n\nIndeed, in a 2019 testimony, just prior to the GFA being signed into law, IRI Regional Director for Latin America and the Caribbean Antonio Garrastazu remarked before the House Foreign Affairs Committee that Haiti has \"vast national security implications\" to the U.S.. Garrastazu explained that \"Haiti serves as an important U.S. ally in the region\" because it counters \"Chinese interference\" by \"maintaining its strong relationship with Taiwan\" which \"helps prevent China from concluding, through its Belt and Road Initiative,... questionable infrastructure projects.\"\n\nWashington also wants to prevent Haiti from developing closer diplomatic relations and economic ties with Russia. President Jovenel Mo\u00efse established formal diplomatic relations with Moscow only one month before his assassination two and a half years ago, accrediting Russian ambassador Sergey Melik-Bagdasarov. It was the first time Haiti had established diplomatic relations with Russia. Many argue that this could have been a factor which might have led Washington to green-light Mo\u00efse's assassination.\n\nThe U.S. government's efforts to organize the MSS over the past 18 months is necessary to install a government which will agree to signing the GFA, which will create a bilateral agreement for the deployment of U.S. troops in Haiti.\n\nU.S. Defense and State Departments Planned Psyops Campaign\n\nIn a prepared statement delivered to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs on the Defense Department's role in the GFA on May 11, 2022, Jim Saenz, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Stabilization Policy, explained that the \"DoD's role in GFA implementation is to support the efforts of the Department of State as the lead, and the USAID as the lead implementer\" to \"ensure that the 10-year plans ...align the relevant goals, objectives, plans, and benchmarks with DoD policy.\"\n\nThe State department provided more detail on how the DoD would achieve these objectives in an important planning document titled \"United States Strategy to Prevent Conflict and Promote Stability\" published by the Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations.\n\nIt explained that in order to \"prevent conflict and address global fragility\" they will implement \"specialized activities\" that include \"psychological operations\"and \"information operations engagements\" (formerly referred to as \"information warfare\"). In other words, the DoD and DoS will engage in what are commonly referred to as psyops - \"psychological operations\" - to manufacture consent and distract the populations in and outside Haiti to further U.S. foreign policy goals.\n\nIndeed, section 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) provisions affirms that the DoD can conduct \"military operations\" in the information environment, \"including clandestine operations,\" that are in defense of U.S. interests.\n\nThe DoD and the CIA are not the only source of psyops campaigns aimed at propagating disinformation. Canadian private military contractor INKAS, which provided armored vehicles to the Haitian National Police (PNH) attempted to conduct a social media disinformation campaign last year.\n\nInvestigative journalist Dan Cohen uncovered a coordinated social media troll campaign aimed primarily at those who opposed the Canadian government's sale of armored vehicles to PM Ariel Henry's regime.\n\nCohen explained that \"INKAS sold armored vehicles to Haiti, some of which were delivered in October 2022.\" These armored vehicles were used to enforce an attack against the FRG9's blockade on the Varreux fuel terminal. The blockade's aim was to force Henry from office while protesting the government's recent removal of fuel subsidies most Haitians depended on to make fuel affordable.\n\nThe social media campaign involved several troll accounts which used images of Black people taken from various websites such as unsplash.com. These troll accounts claimed Haitian identities. They either posted comments promoting the Canadian government's foreign policy in Haiti or attacked Cohen and other accounts which offered criticism.\n\nIf not for Cohen's investigative journalism, these Canadian arms manufacturer troll accounts would have grown, collecting followers and popularity. This episode is a clear warning to advocates who use social media to be wary of anonymous accounts which attack investigative journalists and offer criticism that objectively supports Washington's imperialist policies in Haiti.\n\n\"Manipulating the Information Environment\" in Haiti\n\nOrganizations in and outside of Haiti have already conducted a successful campaign of disinformation and propaganda designed to distract the population and turn advocates for Haiti against each other.\n\nIndeed, in IRI Regional Director Garrastazu's testimony to Congress, he highlighted that \"by maintaining a good relationship with Haiti, the U.S. will help ensure China does not gain yet another foothold in Latin America and the Caribbean using corruption to secure preferential terms for Chinese state-owned companies and manipulating the information environment,\" on which Washington clearly has a stranglehold.\n\nAdvocates for Haiti who ignore or dismiss the vast propaganda network Washington and CORE group members like Canada maintain through direct funding or the funding of NGOs and CSOs (and some private foundations like Open Society Foundations and AJWS) will inevitably contaminate their analyses with talking points drawn from this vast disinformation network.

While currently, catastrophic challenges persist, beneath the surface lies a wellspring of potential waiting to be unleashed. This presents a compelling opportunity not just for Haiti, but for the entire Caribbean Community (CARICOM). By harnessing Haiti's potential, we can create a ripple effect of prosperity throughout the region, igniting a new era of economic growth and social progress.\n\nHistory offers a powerful testament to the ability of nations to rise from the ashes. Rwanda, after the devastating genocide of 1994, has achieved significant economic growth and stability. Vietnam, once ravaged by war, is now a rapidly growing economy. These examples, alongside Germany's post-war transformation, Ireland's rise from economic struggles, South Korea's emergence as a tech leader, and Ethiopia's development in the wake of the overthrow of HIM Haile Selassie I, social upheaval, and periods of grinding famine, serve as a beacon of hope for Haiti. This inherent resilience will be a driving force in Haiti's economic recovery.\n\nSeveral factors make Haiti an attractive investment destination for CARICOM entrepreneurs, bankers, and governments:\n\nUntapped Resources: Haiti is blessed with abundant natural resources. Sustainable development of these resources, coupled with investments in green enterprises, agriculture, and tourism, can significantly boost economic activity across the Caribbean.\n\nThe Leucaena Advantage: Hispaniola, including Haiti and neighbouring Jamaica, is particularly well-suited for the growth of alley-cropped Leucaena leucocephala**. This \"miracle tree\" provides livestock fodder, improves soil fertility, and generates ligno-cellulose copiously. Leucaena's integration into Caribbean agriculture can bolster food security, combat deforestation, and empower rural communities.\n\nHuman Capital Powerhouse: Haiti boasts a young and vibrant population. By investing in education, healthcare, and vocational artisanal training, particularly in green technology and traditional crafts, we can unlock the immense potential of Haiti's human capital. This skilled workforce will then fuel innovation and technological advancements across CARICOM, creating a more competitive Caribbean economic bloc.\n\nEmpowering Women, Strengthening the Region: Studies consistently demonstrate that investing in the female workforce fuels economic growth. Haiti has a strong tradition of female entrepreneurship. By channeling resources towards education, skills training, and access to capital for Haitian women, we can empower not just Haiti, but the entire Caribbean.\n\nFacilitating Trade: French, one of the two official languages of Haiti, should be prioritised in business communication and investment negotiations. This, with a modicum of CARICOM area CXC-level English, will smooth the path for trade and collaboration between Haiti and its CARICOM partners.\n\nThe time to act is now. CARICOM nations have a unique opportunity to partner with Haiti and be there at the forefront of its returning economic resurgence. Here's how we can turn this vision into reality:\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships: Governments and the private sector can collaborate to create an investment-friendly environment in Haiti. Streamlining regulations, fostering transparency, and prioritizing infrastructure development will attract investors and entrepreneurs from across the region.\n\nKnowledge Sharing and Collaboration: CARICOM nations can share expertise and resources to support Haiti's development. Technical assistance programs, joint ventures, and knowledge transfer initiatives can empower Haitians and create a win-win situation for the entire Caribbean.\n\nBuilding a Sustainable Future: Sustainable development practices should be at the core of all investments. By focusing on renewables, responsible resource utilization, and environmental protection, we can ensure long-term prosperity for Haiti and the entire Caribbean.\n\nHaiti's potential is undeniable. By harnessing its resilience, resources, and human capital, Haiti can become an engine of growth for the entire Caribbean. Through collaborative efforts, knowledge sharing, and a commitment to sustainable development, CARICOM nations can seize this opportunity and usher in a new era of prosperity for the region. Let us join hands, invest in Haiti's future, and together, build a brighter Caribbean future for all.\n\nIf I were the rightful owner of US$1 million, I would certainly contact three smart, hardworking Haitian colleagues of mine with a view to reserving at least US$400,000 of my own money for investment in that beautiful place as soon as it settles itself down again.\n\n**Dr. George Wilson, late renowned Jamaican agricultural scientist, was remarkable for his contributions to alley cropping, a sustainable agricultural practice that involves planting rows of trees or shrubs alongside crops to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. Dr. Wilson's work at IITA, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria, focused on developing innovative farming techniques that integrated Gliricidia and or Leucaena trees into agricultural systems to enhance soil health, increase biodiversity, and boost crop yields. Alley cropping, also known as agroforestry, is a method that combines the benefits of trees and crops in a mutually beneficial system. By planting trees in rows between crop plants, alley cropping helps reduce soil erosion, improve water retention, provide shade, and enhance nutrient cycling, ultimately leading to more sustainable and productive farming practices. Dr. George Wilson's research and advocacy for alley cropping have significantly influenced sustainable agriculture practices, particularly in some tropical regions, by promoting environmentally friendly and economically viable farming methods that benefit both farmers and the environment.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors":

Urgent action is needed to help prevent the situation from spiraling even further out of control and to ensure that Haitians' basic rights are respected and their security and humanitarian needs are met.\n\nIn October 2023, the UN Security Council authorized the deployment of a Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission to address the dire humanitarian crisis and insecurity in Haiti. Council members also acknowledged the holistic approach needed to address the multiple dimensions of the worsening crisis.\n\nYet, while members of the international community have taken some steps in response, the deployment of the force and other critical components of a rights-based response are stalled and face significant budget shortfalls.\n\nHuman Rights Watch is concerned about this limited progress. On January 25, Tirana Hassan, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, addressed the UN Security Council on Haiti, highlighting the need for a rights-based international response amid a surge in killings and kidnappings, rampant sexual violence, and a severe food crisis. Similarly, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, has repeatedly raised the alarm about \"the need for an urgent deployment of a Multinational Security Support mission to help the National Police to stop violence.\"\n\nHaiti's crisis has reached a critical moment. Criminal groups that kill, rape, and kidnap at will, have brought transportation, health care, education and the delivery of humanitarian assistance to a near standstill across much of the country, deepening the existing humanitarian crisis. Between January and late March 2024, criminal groups killed 1,554 people not involved in the violence and injured 826 others, according to the United Nations. Nearly half of Haitians face acute food insecurity and 1.4 million people are at risk of famine, according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP). Thousands of children are out of school, and criminal groups' use and recruitment of children is increasing. The state appears to be near collapse. Despite the efforts of the Haitian National Police, officers are overwhelmed and unable to protect people. As a result, many Haitians face grave threats to their basic human rights -- including the rights to life, health, food, water, and education, among others.\n\nA deep political deadlock is contributing to the dramatic increase in violence and its spread to previously safe parts of the country and aggravating longer-running, systemic challenges to governance, including corruption and impunity.\n\nAfter political discussions led by the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), on March 11 Haitian political and civil society representatives agreed to the establishment of a Presidential Transitional Council. Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who has not been able to return to the country since early March, announced that he would resign once the new presidential council was formed. However, other actors, some linked to violent criminal groups, have rejected CARICOM's initiative and are advocating for alternative solutions to the political deadlock, raising concerns that individuals responsible for violence and human rights abuses against the Haitian people in recent years may soon seize control of the country.\n\nGiven this context, and a long history of failed, and often abusive, international interventions in Haiti, we fear the situation in Haiti will further deteriorate if urgent steps are not taken to address the multifaceted crisis in a coordinated, comprehensive, and rights-respecting way.\n\nThe European Union is in a strong position to play a positive and supportive role in shaping the response to the Haiti crisis. We encourage you to deploy sound political engagement and consider re-directing financial support to specific actions necessary in the following key areas:\n\nRestoring security: In light of the EU's announcement of possible indirect support for the objectives of the Multinational Security Support mission, we encourage the EU to work with Security Council members and support initiatives to ensure the mission includes rigorous human rights due diligence and human rights monitoring, to avoid repeating failures and abuses of past interventions in Haiti.\n\nFollowing the United Nations Security Council members' promise to the people of Haiti, the EU should also consider more direct support to the UN-authorized mission by providing it with the necessary funding, personnel, and technical capacities to allow its prompt deployment and effective support to the Haitian National Police, to help restore minimum security conditions, including security for the transitional government, and the functioning of critical infrastructure.\n\nPolitical transition: Following the EU's statement that a Haitian-led \"viable, inclusive and sustainable political transition\" is the only path to stability, we call on the EU to use all tools at its disposal to support the establishment of the new presidential council, including supporting the vetting process of candidates through a review of information available within the framework of sanctions regimes. Once the council is established, we call on the EU to use its ability and resources to support the council's efforts to restore basic security and hold free, fair, and credible elections within a clearly defined timetable.\n\nHumanitarian needs: Noting that Haiti is the main recipient of EU humanitarian aid in the region, we welcome the EU's announcement to continue its humanitarian response in Haiti. However, humanitarian organizations, including Haitian grassroots organizations, which are providing vital assistance to many Haitians at risk or in need, are running out of resources. We call on the EU to urgently provide them with more funding to help keep Haitians alive.\n\nJustice and accountability: The EU should work with the new transitional government and UN agencies, using its existing policies and programs, to provide training and technical support to a specialized pool of Haitian judicial investigators, prosecutors, and judges who would focus on ensuring accountability for the most serious crimes committed by members of criminal groups and those supporting them. The EU should support initiatives to ensure that detention facilities are secure and humane and that criminal proceedings respect human rights. It should also support efforts to set up assistance programs for victims of violence to provide them with access to justice, reparations, rehabilitation, and psychological support.\n\nUse of sanctions regime: We call on the EU to list under its autonomous framework for restrictive measures individuals most responsible for serious humans rights abuses in Haiti, any actor responsible for providing support to criminal groups in Haiti, as well as those allegedly implicated in high-level official corruption.\n\nCurbing arms flows: As stated in the joint EU-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) declaration, the EU and Latin American and Caribbean governments should step up their collaboration and adopt stronger measures to stop the illicit flow and sale of weapons and ammunition to criminal groups operating in Haiti. The EU should ensure its member states improve enforcement of the UN arms embargo on Haiti by increasing inspections at seaports and airports. Reports of violations of the arms embargo, with a special focus on transfers of small arms, should be reported to the UN Security Council's Haiti sanctions committee, panel of experts, and other relevant bodies.\n\nMigration: The EU should raise its voice to condemn forced returns to Haiti as long as conditions in the country present a real risk of serious harm and human rights abuses.\n\nHaitians need principled engagement centered on their needs right now. The EU can help by providing the necessary resources and supporting the actions outlined above to respond to the many dimensions of the crisis, allowing Haitians finally see a path toward democratic governance, basic security, the rule of law, and access to basic necessities.\n\nSincerely,\n\nIda Sawyer, Crisis and Conflict Director, Human Rights Watch\n\nPhilippe Dam, EU Advocacy Director, Human

While the nonprofit provides resources and financial support, it is the monitrices, with their knowledge and capabilities, who are working to combat malnutrition in Haiti, officials with the organization said in an interview Friday.\n\n\"We bring those tools and training so we can empower them (the monitrices) so they can be helpful for the community by providing a holistic health care package for the children and also the women -- women between 19 and 45 years old, what we call pregnant age,\" said Dr. Anany Prosper, the organization's country director, who specializes in public health.\n\nIF YOU GO\n\nWhat: Hope for Haiti Walk-A-Thon, also featuring food trucks and children's activities\n\nWhen: 9 a.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: Coolidge Park, 150 River St.\n\nPrice: Registration costs $30, which includes a T-shirt, snack and water.\n\nMore info: cnphaiti.org\n\n(READ MORE: Chattanooga-area mother who lost daughter to drugs deals with grief through action)\n\nRather than wait for people to admit themselves to hospitals, the monitrices go into communities for home visits, identifying needs and providing health services and educational sessions, Prosper said. Malnutrition not only affects individuals; it also affects populations, he said. If underlying causes of malnutrition -- lack of good health practices and knowledge, health care access and social services -- are not addressed, then malnutrition passes on from generation to generation, Prosper said.\n\nOngoing political and social turmoil in Haiti, such as armed violence perpetrated by gangs, has contributed to the nation's troubles, NBC News has reported, and the violence has created a greater risk of malnutrition by disrupting organizations' ability to deliver aid, according to UNICEF. Furthermore, the violence destabilizes \"social pillars\" like health care, putting a greater strain on an already embattled system, said Prosper, who was born and raised in Haiti.\n\n(READ MORE: Hunger soars and aid dwindles as gangs in Haiti suffocate the country)\n\nDespite the violence, the Children's Nutrition Program continues its work, and its all-Haitian staff members in the country have remained safe, according to the organization's executive director, Patricia Cyr Watlington. The nonprofit seeks to disrupt the cycle of malnutrition by working with the people of Haiti on Haitian-driven solutions rather than just providing aid, Watlington said, using an old proverb to describe the organization's work.\n\n\"We believe that when you give people a fish instead of teaching them to fish, then they're always out with their hands waiting for the next fish,\" Watlington said. \"And so, the belief is that you teach them how to empower themselves. What can they do in their community, their neighborhood, with the resources they have, versus bringing things in and teaching them our ways? We try to incorporate their ways.\"\n\nPhoto GalleryChattanooga nonprofit Children's Nutrition Program of Haiti to host inaugural walk to support embattled nation\n\nDuring discussions on how to raise funds for and awareness of the nonprofit, Watlington and Haden Gibbons, the organization's director of marketing and development, landed on the idea of hosting a walk-a-thon. The monitrices in Haiti walk up to 8 miles a day over rugged terrain, and so, the walk in Chattanooga, which will be more than 2 miles, is meant to honor that effort, Gibbons said.

Congregation members including dentist Gregory Doroski, eye doctor Jeffrey Williams, Tom Christiansen and Rory MacNish have traveled there and back many times offering assistance such as well digging.\n\nThe person behind the church's effort is its former pastor, George Gaffga, who made his first trip to Haiti in 1984 to determine if money raised locally and intended for that country was being used wisely. He came away convinced that the money was needed, that it was being well spent and that much, much more was required.\n\nSeeing Haiti's extreme poverty up close -- it is among the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere -- motivated him and gave birth to the program. The Rev. Gaffga is now retired and living in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"That trip changed me, changed members of the congregation, and started our mission in Haiti that is still ongoing and strong,\" he said. \"I couldn't be more proud of it ... The next year I went with my son, who was 8. We went to the island of LaGonave.\"\n\nThis is the island -- between Haiti's north and south forks -- Mr. Jean-Francois comes from and where his family lives today.\n\n\"The poverty and the conditions are desperate and always have been,\" the Rev. Gaffga said. \"The people are genuinely wonderful. They work hard.\"\n\nIn recent months, heavily armed gangs have all but taken over Haiti. There is no organized, effective central government. Haiti prime ministers come and go. Late last month, the most recent prime minister resigned and a new governing council was sworn in. While the ceremony was underway, gunshots were heard in the background, The New York Times reported.\n\nMr. Jean-Francois' family house on LaGonave is overflowing with refugees from other communities fleeing the violence and gangs. Food shipments have been disrupted.\n\nThis is how The New York Times described Haiti last week: \"Armed gangs -- some of which are now working together -- continue to attack neighborhoods, looting houses, kidnapping civilians, raping women and killing people at random, rights groups say. And the gang leaders have said they intend to do what they can to disrupt the current political process.\"\n\nAs all this plays out, Mr. Jean-Francois does his best to keep his spirits up. He talks to his wife and children as often as he can. There is no way to get them out. Nor is there any way for him to return due to the chaos. His visa runs out next March.

At least three planes leased by the country's national carriers were struck by bullets during one of the attacks, forcing even the suspension of in-country flights in and out of Port-au-Prince.\n\nOn March 4 the three U.S.-based carriers flying into Haiti announced they were suspending operations, citing the civil unrest.\n\nA search of American Airlines reservations shows the first available flights in and out of Port-au-Prince to be June 1. While travelers can book at one-way ticket from Miami for $125, getting out of the gang-fueled violence of the capital will cost a lot more. A one-way ticket from Port-au-Prince to Miami is $1,975 for a premium ticket. The main cabin won't be available until June 4 and the cost for a ticket from Haiti to Miami is $882. The price of a one-way to Miami shows a significant drop after that.\n\nShould American Airlines actually start service on May 16, its daily service between Miami and Haiti would commence the day after JetBlue Airways' tentative resumption date, May 15. The airline flies to Toussaint Louverture from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.\n\nSpirit Airlines also flies out FLL-Hollywood. Spokesman Michael Lopardi said service to Port-au-Prince and Cap-Ha\u00eftien \"remains suspended.\" This leaves only Haiti-based Sunrise Airways, which has been flying passengers in and out of the country through Cap-Ha\u00eftien's Hugo Chavez International Airport.\n\nThe two-month stoppage of flights into Port-au-Prince has led a number of Haitians stranded in South Florida. Others in Haiti have managed to escape the violence on flights organized by the State Department and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nHaving regular air service resume between Port-au-Prince and the United States is an exercise in building confidence, those involved in the effort acknowledge.\n\nSince the gang insurrection began on Feb. 29, Haitian government officials have demolished about 200 homes around the airport -- to keep gangs from using rooftops to fire at planes -- and beefed up security around the airport's perimeter. There are now security towers dotting the tarmac and members of the army and Haiti National Police are on constant patrol.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has continued landing aircraft on the tarmac in Port-au-Prince ahead of a pending arrival later this month of the first police officers from Kenya, who will serve as the backbone of a multinational security force. The flights, coordinated by the U.S. Southern Command in Doral, have delivered humanitarian aid and equipment for the Haiti National Police, which were purchased by the government of Haiti. The Biden administration, which recently announced it will tap two accounts for $10 million and $60 million to assist the police and the Multinational Security Support mission, will also be sending additional assistance to the police, including armored vehicles.\n\nA recent flight dropped off civilian contractors who will build the base near the airport for the a-led Multinational Security Support mission.", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacqueline_charles@miamiherald.com", "name": "Jacqueline Charles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-au-Prince", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Port-au-Prince"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Port-au-Prince"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Haiti"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toussaint Louverture International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunrise Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toussaint_Louverture", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toussaint Louverture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spirit Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JetBlue", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JetBlue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John F.

What will become of the historic building?", "body": "Des Moines is adding its historic City Hall to the list of buildings it plans to vacate as it consolidates its operations in a former Nationwide Mutual Insurance office it purchased late last year.\n\nThe city had previously indicated that it would sell off two of its other riverfront properties -- Des Moines Police Headquarters at 25 E. First St and the Argonne Armory at 602 Robert D. Ray Drive -- when those departments move to the new offices at 1200 Locust St. The location was renamed in December as the T.M. Franklin Cownie City Administration Building, in honor of the retiring mayor.\n\nThe possibility of moving some or all of the offices in City Hall, 400 Robert D. Ray Drive, was mentioned, but the plan will become official Monday with approval from City Council.\n\nThe 66,000-square-foot City Hall is three stories tall and sits on a 1.244-acre parcel on the east bank of the Des Moines River between the Locust and Grand Avenue bridges. A resolution listed on the consent portion of the agenda, which can be approved without discussion, notes that the City Hall is \"no longer sufficient to meet present or long-term needs of the city residents or city staff.\"\n\nThe resolution also notes the costs associated with heating and maintaining the building, security issues and challenges related to remodeling the existing structure.\n\nHowever, unlike with the Armory and police headquarters, the city doesn't anticipate on putting City Hall on the market. A communication to the council says the city staff plan on putting together a long-term lease agreement similar to the 2009 deal that allowed World Food Prize Foundation century-long use of the former city library at 100 Locust St.\n\nPreviously: 'Spaces the public can come to and enjoy' goal for reuse of Des Moines police HQ, armory\n\n\"It is not anticipated that the City Hall property will be sold as part of future redevelopment proposals that will be considered,\" the communication item says.\n\nCity records show that the building -- renovated from 2016 to 2018 at a cost of $5.5 million\\ -- will be available for \"repositioning as an asset to the community\" as early as 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, a resolution slated to be passed Monday evening gives the city manager's office permission to begin fielding interest from prospective occupants. Des Moines will give preference to projects that put an emphasis on public use while honoring the building's historic features.\n\nDes Moines recently selected Gold Cap Development, Sidekick Development and Wade Investments to develop the parking lot across from City Hall. The plans call for 76 apartments and multiple restaurant and retail spaces on the first floor.\n\nThe deadline to submit proposals is December 31, 2024. Submissions will be reviewed by stakeholders and later presented to City Council.\n\nDes Moines Performing Arts announced Thursday that it intended to make a bid for the Argonne Armory at 602 Robert D. Ray Drive -- another prime piece of city-owned real estate on the edge of the East Village.\n\nCEO Jeff Chelesvig in an email to supporters Thursday said the nonprofit will present a proposal this week to the City Council to purchase the armory and transform it into a \"state-of-the-art\" education center. City staff estimate that renovations would cost $15 million.\n\nWhile the nonprofit currently operates programming at the Temple Theater for the Performing Arts, Stoner Theater and Des Moines Civic Center, Chelesvig said it sorely needs the extra space as demand for programming increases.\n\n\"Summer camps sell out with a waiting list in under 90 minutes and our Iowa High School Musical Theater Awards program has grown to be the largest of its kind in the nation,\" Chelesvig said. \"As we have shared before, we are well positioned to address this growing need; however, one hurdle remains -- the need for physical space.\"\n\nBuilt in 1909 and 1910 at a cost of $500,000 -- roughly $15 million in today's dollars -- Des Moines City Hall was seen as a celebration of the city's adoption in 1907 of a new commission style of government that became a national model, imitated by many other cities.\n\nBob Turner, an associate professor of political science at Skidmore College, wrote in \"The Curious History of the Commission Form of Government\" that the new governing mode included nonpartisan elections, merit selection of employees and the ability of citizens to initiate referendums on issues and recalls of elected officials (the commission government's emphasis on bureaucratic expertise would later become controversial, and Des Moines would abandon it in favor of the current council-manager system of government in the 1950s.)\n\nThe new building, in keeping with the theme of citizen empowerment and openness, eschewed private offices for minor officials and featured a central hall on the second floor where residents could speak to representatives of every department of the government. Marking the laying of the City Hall cornerstone was a cavalry parade with 1,000 horses, speeches by dignitaries from around the nation, a banquet and a large display depicting planned civic improvements, the Des Moines Register reported.\n\n\"It is the purpose to make this ceremony and other exercises during the day and evening an exhibition of municipal progress under the commission form of government,\" then-Mayor James R. Hanna said in a proclamation, calling for the city's businesses and institutions to observe the day as an unofficial holiday.\n\nAddison Lathers covers growth and development for the Des Moines metro.

A communication to the council says the city staff anticipates putting together a long-term lease agreement similar to the 2009 deal that allowed World Food Prize Foundation century-long use of the former city library at 100 Locust St.\n\nPreviously: 'Spaces the public can come to and enjoy' goal for reuse of Des Moines police HQ, armory\n\n\"It is not anticipated that the City Hall property will be sold as part of future redevelopment proposals that will be considered,\" the communication item says.\n\nDes Moines to solicit proposals for City Hall that emphasize public use\n\nCity records show that the building will be available for \"repositioning as an asset to the community\" as early as 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, a resolution slated to be passed Monday evening gives the city manager's office permission to begin fielding interest from prospective occupants. Des Moines will give preference to projects that put an emphasis on public use while honoring the building's historic features.\n\nDes Moines recently selected Gold Cap Development, Sidekick Development and Wade Investments to develop the parking lot across from City Hall. The plans call for 76 apartments and multiple restaurant and retail spaces on the first floor.\n\nThe deadline to submit proposals is December 31, 2024. Submissions will be reviewed by stakeholders and later presented to City Council.\n\nAnnouncement follows interest in neighboring property\n\nDes Moines Performing Arts announced Thursday that it intended to make a bid for the Argonne Armory at 602 Robert D. Ray Drive -- another prime piece of city-owned real estate on the edge of the East Village.\n\nCEO Jeff Chelesvig In an email to supporters Thursday said the nonprofit will present a proposal this week to the City Council to purchase the armory and transform it into a \"state-of-the-art\" education center. City staff estimate that renovations would cost $15 million.\n\nWhile the nonprofit currently operates programming at the Temple Theater for the Performing Arts, Stoner Theater and Des Moines Civic Center, Chelesvig said it sorely needs the extra space as demand for programming increases.\n\n\"Summer camps sell out with a waiting list in under 90 minutes and our Iowa High School Musical Theater Awards program has grown to be the largest of its kind in the nation,\" Chelesvig said. \"As we have shared before, we are well positioned to address this growing need; however, one hurdle remains -- the need for physical space.\"\n\nBuilding was a celebration of new governing style\n\nBuilt in 1909 and 1910 at a cost of $500,000 -- roughly $15 million in today's dollars -- Des Moines City Hall was seen as a celebration of the city's adoption in 1907 of a new commission style of government that became a national model, imitated by many other cities.\n\nBob Turner, an associate professor of political science at Skidmore College, wrote in \"The Curious History of the Commission Form of Government\" that the new governing mode included nonpartisan elections, merit selection of employees and the ability of citizens to initiate referendums on issues and recalls of elected officials (the commission government's emphasis on bureaucratic expertise would later become controversial, and Des Moines would abandon it in favor of the current council-manager system of government in the 1950s.)\n\nThe new building, in keeping with the theme of citizen empowerment and openness, eschewed private offices for minor officials and featured a central hall on the second floor where residents could speak to representatives of every department of the government. Marking the laying of the City Hall cornerstone was a cavalry parade with 1,000 horses, speeches by dignitaries from around the nation, a banquet and a large display depicting planned civic improvements, the Des Moines Register reported.\n\n\"It is the purpose to make this ceremony and other exercises during the day and evening an exhibition of municipal progress under the commission form of government,\" then-Mayor James R. Hanna said in a proclamation, calling for the city's businesses and institutions to observe the day as an unofficial holiday.", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Des Moines Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Town hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_D._Ray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert D.

Currently, the DMPA estimates that the education and community outreach programs impact over 70,000 people annually, this building would expand the organization's ability -- benefitting an estimated 20,000 more people.\n\n\"We don't quite know what it's going to cost yet but we think it's going to be around that ($15 million),\" said Jeff Chelesvig, President and CEO of Des Moines Performing Arts. \"We've been looking at a number of different buildings in downtown Des Moines. We even own some property that we were looking at the possibility of building something, but we think repurposing an existing historic building is much more exciting.\"\n\nThe city says other proposals will be considered as they come in. With city staff not expecting to move out of the building until 2026, the council has time to make a decision. But the city is intrigued at the prospect of the DMPA purchasing the building.\n\n\"And if you look at what the East Village has become, what the East Village wants to leverage is the success of the businesses here. They need people and the East Village needs a lot more activity than we can bring as a government office,\" said Matt Anderson, the deputy city manager of Des Moines. \"So if you look at the tens of thousands of people that Des Moines Performing Arts brings through, so if you picture parents dropping their kids off for practice, they're going to stay around for an hour or two hours.\"\n\nHaving parents stay and shop and eat is something the city views as an ideal scenario with whoever the future occupant of the Argonne Armory is, but the local landmark piece is important for the future of the building when the city doesn't own the property.\n\n\"We want to preserve this building in the future. If 40 or 50 years down the road Des Moines Performing Arts, they have a change of plans, they sell the building, they want to do something different with it, at least we'll have the ability to have some say in what happens to that building, particularly the exterior of it, so that we can preserve it as a kind of featured building on our Riverwalk,\" said Anderson.", "source": {"uri": "who13.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "who13.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_fisher@who13.com", "name": "Zach Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines_City_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines City Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Moines,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Des Moines, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Village,_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Village, Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Village, Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Anderson_(volleyball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Anderson (volleyball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Building Types", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Historic_Preservation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Historic Preservation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Preservation", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Preservation", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Build Management", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Standards_and_Codes", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Standards and Codes", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://who13.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2018/05/promo350350578.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554179", "eventUri": "eng-9554179", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

She already worked as an art advisor, helping places like Bubba in downtown Des Moines source pieces like the bow tie artwork and dapper hats that give the restaurant a bump in personality.\n\nLidgett estimated that she needed to sell four pieces of artwork a month to afford the space.\n\nFlash forward five years, and Liz Lidgett Gallery + Design in the East Village in Des Moines sells more than 100 pieces a month.\n\n\"We ship 80% to 90% of what we sell,\" Lidgett said in her bright gallery surrounded by wrapped panels from fiber artist Anna Beurskens from San Francisco, pop art beetles by Kevin Brent Morris painted in bright colors out of Overland Park, Kansas, and vibrant flowers from Des Moines-based artist Jenna Brownlee.Silver garden snakes created by Paige Barnes-Dorsey of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, dangle from the wall or a table while ceramic wall art from Eliana Bernard of Austin, Texas, showcases muted palettes in rounded shapes, almost like a delicate windchime.\n\n\"The business just really changed from what I originally thought it was going to be,\" she said. She means that in the best ways possible.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nOn Friday, Lidgett celebrates her fifth anniversary with an open house at the gallery. She expects 25 of the artists she represents to be in person at the event from 5 to 8 p.m. that is open to the public. Each of the 67 artists -- with at least half of them women -- represented at the gallery contributed a piece for a group exhibit that opens at the show.\n\nAside from a day of showing artists Des Moines, including a trip to the Des Moines Art Center, she has workshops planned with the artists.\n\n\"Being an artist can be really solitary. So we're gonna be doing some learning from each other and some education pieces that artists don't often get once they've graduated from their MFA,\" she said.\n\nOn top of that, she has clients coming in from South Dakota, Missouri, Virginia, Connecticut. \"We're just going to celebrate the way that this city has supported us.\"\n\nHow Liz Lidgett grew her gallery business\n\nLidgett has never been afraid to delve into something new. She created a podcast, \"Ten Minute Masterpieces,\" that explores the origins of famous pieces of art. She sold NFT art of whimsical resin pops created by California-based artist Betsy Enzensberger. She's working with artists to digitize their works to display on television screens in homes, a new canvas, so to speak, and at a lower, more affordable price point.\n\nShe's helped get more than 100 murals painted across the city, from artists such as Des Moines-based James Navarro, who has four murals at the Iowa State Fairgrounds and two at Oak Park, the new American restaurant on Ingersoll Avenue, as well as Brownlee, who painted works in the District at Prairie Trail in Ankeny and the Parker Apartments on Seventh Street in downtown Des Moines. She even worked to get the Ben Schuh \"Better Together, Better Forever\" mural on the side of the Renaissance Des Moines Savery Hotel painted.\n\nYou can find hints of Lidgett's personality with the neon sign inside the courtyard at the Surety Hotel in downtown Des Moines or the selfie artwork in the bathrooms at her East Village neighbor Clyde's Fine Diner. She created the china wall and more at Either/Or, the new American restaurant on the border of Des Moines and West Des Moines.\n\nShe flexes her creative design eye through her full-service art advising firm for personal and corporate collections, and she helped place artwork found inside Racoon Valley Bank in Grimes, Bankers Trust in Des Moines, and the Des Moines Metro Opera in Indianola.\n\nMore:Pieces from the John and Mary Pappajohn art collection go up for auction for millions\n\nHow e-commerce helped the Liz Lidgett's gallery blossom\n\nIt wasn't easy, but Lidgett has the grace, vibrant personality, and enthusiasm to make it seem easy.\n\nThe Des Moines Roosevelt graduate who earned her bachelor's degree from the University of Missouri in journalism and a master's degree in public art from the University of Southern California had to contend with the pandemic, which shut down her gallery less than a year after it opened in 2019. \"We worked really hard on the e-commerce side. That really grew the business to a national level,\" she said.\n\nNow most of her clients -- from all 50 states as well as Canada, Australia, Argentina, Switzerland, and the Netherlands -- probably haven't seen the art they buy in person. About 80% of the artwork from the gallery is sold online, she said. Pieces range from $200 to $15,000 with prices clearly listed.\n\nShe reaches customers through social media that showcases the gallery, the artists, and Lidgett, who takes center stage as the expert guide. That effort really went into overdrive during the pandemic.\n\nLidgett's personal Instagram page now has 105,000 followers. Her gallery has another 31,000. She uses social media as her medium to reach potential clients, showcasing the art in the gallery against the backdrop of her effervescent personality and bright music. It works.\n\nOnline, she shares tips on how to hang art, how she looks at art, and even the artists' inspirations behind their work in interviews.\n\nMore:This new East Village building is the first of its kind in the United States\n\nHow Liz Lidgett hunted down the artist who made her a big name in art\n\nOne goal she had was to land a big artist to lend to the credibility of the gallery. As she approached artists, many initially said no because her gallery is in Des Moines. \"Call us when you've proven yourself,\" Lidgett said artists who typically sent their work to New York and Los Angeles to sell told her.\n\nShe put together her hit list of artists to approach. Hunt Slonem, the Brooklyn, New York, artist whose bunnies and butterflies painted in oils have a special place in the gallery, was the first she nabbed.\n\n\"As entrepreneurs, we get told no so often. But if you keep going, and you get that, 'Yes,' then so many doors can open,\" she said. \"I'll just love him forever because we had that connection and he gave me that yes, and everything just bloomed from there.\"\n\nLast September, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce named Lidgett's gallery one of America's 70 top small businesses, an honor she earned from an applicant pool of about 15,000.\n\nLast Friday, she graduated from the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses, an intense 12-week program meant to help entrepreneurs create jobs and economic opportunities.\n\nNow she celebrates a fast five years that brings more attention to Des Moines as a place for art and culture. Just recently, a piece by Atlanta-based artist Shannon Coppage entitled \"Rosemary No. 3\" that hangs in Anne Hathaway's kitchen in the new Amazon Prime movie \"The Idea of You\" was available in Lidgett's gallery. It already sold.\n\n\"I would argue with anybody that we've got the best clients in the world,\" Lidgett said a week before her anniversary event. \"Maybe you're new to the art world, but you feel welcomed, and that's our whole goal. I just feel so thankful that this place has become a hub for really interesting, warm people that want to have some beautiful things on their walls.\"", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com",

Four buildings reappear from the first list. One of the 2023 buildings, the Highland Apartments at the corner of Euclid Avenue and Sixth Avenue, has since been demolished in favor of a new mixed-use development.\n\n\"As we saw with those buildings on last year's list, we aren't going to be able to save all of them,\" Tim Waddell, president of the Des Moines Heritage Trust, said in a news release. \"However, we can make a difference. As neighbors and community leaders we can encourage reinvestment of those buildings that have played an important part in the development and growth of our neighborhoods, communities and the families.\"\n\nFrom 1900 to 1952, the building at 2715 S.W. Oralabor Road in Ankeny served as a one-room schoolhouse for the Nagle School District, which later merged with Ankeny schools. By 1957 the school had been converted to a two-bedroom home for the family of Howard Pearson, who ran a cafe\u0301 in Ankeny, according to the trust.\n\nA trucking company used the property as an office from about 1990 to 2019. The schoolhouse was then sold to nonprofit Christian educational network Fairmount Education for $640,000, though Fairmount has since listed it for $1.4 million.\n\nThe building is likely to be razed as the property is marked for neighborhood commercial development in Ankeny's land use plan.\n\nNew: I.O.O.F. Hall\n\nAnother new addition to the trust's annual list is the International Order of Odd Fellows fraternal hall not far from the Highland Park business district. Built in 1907, the building served Highland Park College, which merged with Des Moines College and Central University of Iowa in 1918.\n\nSince 1930, several makeovers have reduced the size of the building's windows and removed its original lodge hall and offices. The original entrance was moved to the corner and architectural details have been obscured with layers of paint, the trust added.\n\nThe last first floor tenant, A to Z Pawn, moved out a couple years ago. The 12 apartments above are vacant, according to the Des Moines Heritage Trust.\n\nThe building faced a possible public nuisance designation from the city earlier this year, as Des Moines Neighborhood Services cited its deteriorating roof.\n\nNew: George Peak home\n\nOnce the home of the Rev. George Peak, 1080 22nd St. was built in 1900 and donated to Drake University in 1944 for use as student housing. Peak played an instrumental role in building downtown's Insurance Exchange Building, now known for its neon-lit Travelers umbrella sign, and a plaque on the building honors him.\n\nThe two-story Peak home has elements of the Georgian Revival and classical architectural styles. Its east facade once had a semi-circular portico with four columns, which was removed over 30 years ago, the trust said. On the second story under the portico was a balcony, and there were five bedrooms upstairs around a central hall.\n\nA returning item from the Heritage Trust's 2023 list, George the Chili King just east of the busy intersection of Hickman and Merle Hay Roads was last remodeled in 1983. The restaurant has retained much of its original charm and look over the years, and, since closing in 2019 after the death of George \"The Chili King\" Karaidos Jr., no demolition permit has been applied for.\n\nHowever, there is literally a sign it could be in danger: It lost its landmark George the Chili King sign in March as a crew used a crane to take down the neon artifact. Des Moines photographer Andy Lyons caught the moment and said the workers told him a collector had bought it.\n\nPlans for the site are unknown, the Des Moines Heritage Trust said.\n\nStill endangered: Salvation Army Building\n\nLocated at 219 E. Court Ave., the former warehouse center of the Salvation Army in central Iowa was built in the 1920s as a factory and distribution center for the National Biscuit Company, better known for its brand name, Nabisco.\n\nThe Salvation Army took over the large building in the 1960s. It sits next to the organization's headquarters at 211 E. Court Ave., acquired in 1956.\n\nThe state shut down the warehouse in September 1999 after an inspector discovered improper asbestos removal by untrained workers. Since then, it has survived a 2008 flood and served as an events center in 2009, according to the Des Moines Heritage Trust.\n\nCurrent plans for the building are unknown. In 2021, the Salvation Army requested the building be replaced with a new structure, but the plan stalled over land-use issues, according to the Des Moines Heritage Trust.\n\nStill endangered: Butler Building\n\nBuilt in 1906, the brick structure at 1501 Grand Ave. contained 16 apartments and two retail spaces, originally occupied by the HS Chase Grocery Store and Meat Market. The Des Moines Heritage Trust says the building serves as an example of early 20th century architecture, with distinct influences of Renaissance and Georgian styles.\n\nFor the past 50 years, music venues and bars such as Blues on Grand, Vicky's Pour House and, most recently, Gas Lamp, occupied the first floor. Since the building's inclusion on last year's list, the Gas Lamp closed on July 9, in part because its landlord, Krause+, plans to renovate the building as part of a broader redevelopment in the Western Gateway district.\n\nMore:The Gas Lamp's final show is in July. Revisit some of its incredible shows over the years.\n\nThe company, which has its headquarters in a dramatic Renzo Piano-designed building across from the Pappajohn Sculpture Park on Grand Avenue, has acquired multiple properties in the district and has ambitious plans, including a hotel and six mixed-use commercial buildings. It already has remodeled another nearby building, a former Chevrolet dealership on Ingersoll Avenue, to house Big Grove Brewery's Des Moines tap room and the HomeGrown restaurant.\n\nKrause+ was awarded $23 million in state tax incentives for plans to renovate the Gas Lamp's building into a four-story mixed-used property. It announced on Facebook in February that maintaining the music venue \"is not a part of the final plan.\"\n\nAs of 2021, Krause+ planned to start construction at the beginning of 2025. The company has yet to apply for building permits, city records show.\n\nStill endangered: Jefferson Apartments\n\nKrause+ also owns the empty Jefferson Apartments a few doors west of the Butler Building at 1519 Grand Ave. Nothing has happened there since the company announced plans for renovations in 2021.\n\nThe building, constructed in 1915, originally had 52 apartments and a cafe\u0301. Renovations in 1938 by the Bankers Life Co. converted the apartments into 72 smaller units, according to the Des Moines Heritage Trust.\n\nWhen tenants received non-renewal notices in July 2021, Jerry Haberman, president of Krause+, told the Des Moines Register the building was in need of significant repairs and that the units needed to be empty to determine the full scope of the work. He said demolition was on the table, though he signaled the company hoped to save the historic structure and maintain affordable units in its renovation plans.\n\nCity records show no applications for permits at that address in the last three years, whether for demolition or construction.", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Des Moines Register"}, "authors":

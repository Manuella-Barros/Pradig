That's exactly what happened on July 23 when a breaching whale capsized a boat off the New Hampshire coast. The U.S. Coast Guard confirmed the damage and shared that the two men on the vessel were safe. Keep scrolling to watch the viral video and see what the Coast Guard and the two victims had to say about the incident.\n\nA breaching whale capsized a boat\n\nTwo fishermen, Greg Paquette and Ryland Kenney, were thrown into the Atlantic Ocean on July 23 after a breaching whale capsized their boat. The Coast Guard confirmed in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter) that they'd received a mayday call after the whale overturned the vessel near Odiorne Point State Park.\n\n\"The occupants were ejected from the vessel as the boat capsized. Sector issued an urgent marine information broadcast (UMIB); they directed Coast Guard Station Portsmouth Harbor to launch,\" the post read.\n\nThe Coast Guard added, \"A good samaritan recovered both individuals from the water. No injuries were reported.\" They also noted that the whale appeared to be uninjured and the Center of Coastal Studies Marine Animal Hotline and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) were also contacted.\n\nGreg Paquette and Ryland Kenney were rescued and uninjured\n\nPaquette and Kenney are grateful to be alive. Brothers Wyatt Yager, 19, and Colin Yager, 16 rescued the two fishermen around 8:00 in the morning, about an hour after they first spotted the whale.\n\n\"I heard a big crackle,\" Kenney, a Dover, New Hampshire resident, told Seacoastonline. \"When that happened ... the bow tipped up and I went to the left and as (the boat) was rolling over I kind of jumped off horizontally to avoid the whale and the boat.\"\n\nKenney felt like they were sent into \"fight or flight mode\" when he and Paquette decided to get off the boat.\n\n\"We're glad they took such quick action,\" Paquette, a Groveland, Massachusetts resident, said regarding the Yager brothers. \"They didn't even think about it. We're really grateful to both of them.\"\n\nPaquette was wearing an inflatable life jacket and remembered seeing the whale's head hit the engine before he landed in the water, while Kenney wasn't wearing a life jacket and didn't have time to use the inflatable ring. Both men came away from the incident with zero injuries.\n\nThe Yager brothers didn't hesitate to help\n\nWyatt, the older of the two brothers, believes he and Colin were only 20 meters away from the whale when they saw it crash into the boat. Colin's video was circulating on social media shortly after the occurrence.\n\n\"I was just in shock. Everyone else had the same reaction and tried to get over to those people,\" Wyatt told Seacoastonline. \"It was like, 'Oh shoot,' and then, 'We've got to go help these people.' All the boats dropped what they were doing to go over to help them.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard was also thankful for the quick rescue. In another post on X, they wrote, \"We are grateful to the good samaritans for taking such quick action to rescue these two individuals. Bravo Zulu!\" They also advise taking caution against whale sightings and remind boaters to contact their local Coast Guard branch.\n\nFor more trending content:\n\nSwindlers Are Targeting Elderly in Maryland With Gold Bar Scams: Report\n\nUSPS Raises Postage Prices: How Your Mail May Be Impacted", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "courtney_shapiro@kentucky.com", "name": "Courtney Shapiro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsizing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capsizing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odiorne_Point_State_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odiorne Point State Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataqua_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piscataqua River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dover, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dover, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Postal Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groveland,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groveland, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Groveland, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 50}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/e1fd6f/picture290396974/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/8481f70d-6033-4394-af3c-be2c34e75354", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 161, "textEnd": 168, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

And while they can be a beautiful sight from afar, sometimes they aren't exactly gentle giants.\n\nNew video out of Portsmouth, New Hampshire showed what happened when a small fishing boat came face to face with an angry whale underwater. In a shocking video circulating on social media, the marine mammal breaches and comes down on the boat, capsizing the vessel and sending its passengers into the ocean.\n\nThe video was taken from another boat just a few dozen feet away by brothers Colin and Wyatt Yager of Maine. Upon seeing the eye-popping confrontation, the young fisherman on the boat dropped his rod and immediately got behind the wheel to get away.\n\nThe identities of the boaters as well as the species of whale are yet to be determined. The waters off New Hampshire can be home to several types of whales including humpback, finback, minke, sei, pilot, right, and blue whales.\n\n\"There is a pissed-off whale patrolling the waters off Portsmouth, New Hampshire today,\" an X post of the video read. \"Head on [a] swivel if you're out there.\"\n\nIt certainly wouldn't be the only recent example of an angry whale.

But it got a little too close to the vessel, causing it to tip over.\n\n\"I was just in shock. Everyone else had the same reaction and tried to get over to those people,\" he said. \"It was like, 'Oh shoot,' and then, 'We've got to go help these people.' All the boats dropped what they were doing to go over to help them.\"\n\nNeither the men thrown into the ocean, nor the whale, were injured, Caballero said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Coast Guard for comment.\n\n'It's been an emotional day,' fisherman says\n\nThe Coast Guard caught wind of the capsized vessel Tuesday morning, which had been tipped over in Rye, a few miles northeast of Portsmouth, Seacoastonline reported. The teens were fishing for menhaden, also known as \"pogies\" a little after 7 a.m.\n\nThe whale crashed into Greg Paquette and Ryland Kenney's boat about an hour later after they spotted the aquatic mammal, immediately launching both men into \"fight or flight mode\" after they were thrown into the water, Seacoastonline reported.\n\n\"I heard a big crackle,\" Kenney told the newspaper. \"When that happened ... the bow tipped up and I went to the left and as (the boat) was rolling over I kind of jumped off horizontally to avoid the whale and the boat.\"\n\nThe last thing Paquette remembers seeing before being thrown into the water was the whale's head, which slammed down on the engine of the boat.\n\n\"Then I saw the whole stern become inundated with water and I thought, 'Oh no. We're going down. We're going to sink now,\" Paquette told Seacoastonline. They managed to swim away from the swamped boat in a matter of seconds and became very tired after the initial \"energy and adrenaline\" wore off.\n\n\"It's been an emotional day,\" Paquette said.\n\nThe men stayed in the Yagers' boat for about 15 minutes, then the brothers dropped them off at a nearby friend's vessel before the Coast Guard arrived, according to Wyatt Yager. Paquette and Kenney were transported to Great Cove Boat Club in Eliot, Maine, after the breach, the two fishermen said.\n\nBoth men were in the water for less than two minutes before they were rescued, with 19-year-old Wyatt and 16-year-old Colin stepping in to help.\n\n\"We're glad they took such quick action,\" Paquette said. \"They didn't even think about it. We're really grateful to both of them.\"\n\nInternet reacts, exchanges memes\n\nWhile the whale seemed to have made a pretty big splash, Colin Yager's reaction to the \"breach\" has inadvertently caused the most attention.\n\nMultiple people have commented on Colin's reaction, pointing out how quickly his instincts kicked in.\n\n\"Kid's like 'I want to go home now,'\" one user wrote. Another said: \"That kid had the right idea lol turned around and was ready to book it.\"\n\nA user named Daisy Evans wrote that the \"incredible scene\" was the result of \"unfortunate timing,\" pointing to the way the whale was breaching under a school of baitfish next to the boat.\n\n\"You can actually see dozens of fish pouring out of its mouth as it impacts the boat. The whale was not attacking,\" she wrote.\n\nContributing: Ian Lenahan; Portsmouth Herald\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Watch: Whale off New Hampshire capsizes boat, men thrown to

He sped over to rescue the two boaters in the water, neither of whom were injured. The whale also appeared to be uninjured, the Coast Guard said.\n\n\"It's was a harrowing experience,\" Gregg Paquette, one of the two passengers knocked over by the whale, told WHDH. He continued, \"We were lucky; we were really lucky.\"\n\nMr. Paquette told the local news station that he was out bait fishing with Ryland Kenney when the whale came from underneath the back of the boat and collapsed onto the stern. Mr. Kenney said the episode happened within a matter of seconds.\n\n\"I was probably about three feet from the whale's head, and I saw him come up and open his mouth,\" Mr. Kenney said. \"I think that's when I was like, 'Whoa,' and his mouth closed and it crunched the engine.\"\n\nThat's when the Yager brothers turned their boat around to rescue their fellow fishermen.\n\n\"I just dropped everything and just started driving over to them,\" Wyatt Yager, 19, told WHDH. \"They swam around to the back and climbed up the ladder.\"\n\nDianna Schulte, a co-founder and director of research at the Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation in Portsmouth, said the whale was likely feeding on bait fish.\n\n\"It's feeding season for many large whales, like humpbacks, who don't eat during their winter breeding season in the Caribbean. This whale wasn't 'angry' -- it was hungry,\" she wrote in a statement posted to social media. \"Boaters happened to be in the area at the same time.\"\n\n\"If you see a whale, don't approach it, or leave your fishing line in the water,\" she added. \"Lines can entangle whales, and whales can damage your boat.\"\n\nIn an email, Ms. Schulte said the whale appeared to be a juvenile and about 30 feet long, adding that her group had not been able to match it to an animal seen in those waters before.\n\nHumpback whales, known for being found close to shore and balletic breaches, are a favorite of whale watchers.

But it got a little too close to the vessel, causing it to tip over.\n\n\"I was just in shock. Everyone else had the same reaction and tried to get over to those people,\" he said. \"It was like, 'Oh shoot,' and then, 'We've got to go help these people.' All the boats dropped what they were doing to go over to help them.\"\n\nNeither the men thrown into the ocean, nor the whale, were injured, Caballero said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Coast Guard for comment.\n\nThe Coast Guard caught wind of the capsized vessel Tuesday morning, which had been tipped over in Rye, a few miles northeast of Portsmouth, Seacoastonline reported. The teens were fishing for menhaden, also known as \"pogies\" a little after 7 a.m.\n\nThe whale crashed into Greg Paquette and Ryland Kenney's boat about an hour later after they spotted the aquatic mammal, immediately launching both men into \"fight or flight mode\" after they were thrown into the water, Seacoastonline reported.\n\n\"I heard a big crackle,\" Kenney told the newspaper. \"When that happened ... the bow tipped up and I went to the left and as (the boat) was rolling over I kind of jumped off horizontally to avoid the whale and the boat.\"\n\nThe last thing Paquette remembers seeing before being thrown into the water was the whale's head, which slammed down on the engine of the boat.\n\n\"Then I saw the whole stern become inundated with water and I thought, 'Oh no. We're going down. We're going to sink now,\" Paquette told Seacoastonline. They managed to swim away from the swamped boat in a matter of seconds and became very tired after the initial \"energy and adrenaline\" wore off.\n\n\"It's been an emotional day,\" Paquette said.\n\nThe men stayed in the Yagers' boat for about 15 minutes, then the brothers dropped them off at a nearby friend's vessel before the Coast Guard arrived, according to Wyatt Yager. Paquette and Kenney were transported to Great Cove Boat Club in Eliot, Maine, after the breach, the two fishermen said.\n\nBoth men were in the water for less than two minutes before they were rescued, with 19-year-old Wyatt and 16-year-old Colin stepping in to help.\n\n\"We're glad they took such quick action,\" Paquette said. \"They didn't even think about it. We're really grateful to both of them.\"\n\nWhile the whale seemed to have made a pretty big splash, Colin Yager's reaction to the \"breach\" has inadvertently caused the most attention.\n\nMultiple people have commented on Colin's reaction, pointing out how quickly his instincts kicked in.\n\n\"Kid's like 'I want to go home now,'\" one user wrote. Another said: \"That kid had the right idea lol turned around and was ready to book it.\"\n\nA user named Daisy Evans wrote that the \"incredible scene\" was the result of \"unfortunate timing,\" pointing to the way the whale was breaching under a school of baitfish next to the boat.\n\n\"You can actually see dozens of fish pouring out of its mouth as it impacts the boat. The whale was not attacking,\" she wrote.\n\nContributing: Ian Lenahan; Portsmouth Herald", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rye,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rye, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rye, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_swivel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing swivel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odiorne_Point_State_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odiorne Point State Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menhaden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Menhaden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shoaling and schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dolphin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Portsmouth_Herald", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Portsmouth Herald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_delta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "River delta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bait fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot,_Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eliot, Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eliot, Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_news_641/9fa2b30a502b1e763fcc47be78c20449", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The video was captured from a nearby boat.\n\nTwo brothers from Maine, Colin, 16, and Wyatt Yager, 19, shot the video on Tuesday and then rescued the fishermen who fell from the overturned boat.\n\nThe Yagers were out fishing when they first noticed the whale, which appeared to be interested in the striped bass they were fishing for. They did their best to stay a safe distance from the whale, they said.\n\nColin took out his phone and started filming, hoping to catch the whale breaching. But they were shocked when it emerged right next to a nearby boat and fell across its stern. The two fishermen leapt from the boat as the whale struck it.\n\n\"Neither of us had ever seen anything like that before,\" said Colin. \"We were just completely in shock for a second or two.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWyatt drove the boat over and helped the two fishermen out of the water. Just one was wearing a life jacket, but they both appeared to be uninjured.\n\n\"One of them had a life jacket and the other didn't; he said he was holding on to the other guy's life jacket. They said they were happy to have that one because it could have gone south otherwise,\" said Wyatt.\n\n\"They seemed to be in good spirits and were OK,\" said Colin.\n\nThe Yagers dropped the fisherman off and spoke with the Coast Guard, which arrived shortly after they'd pulled the fishermen out of the water. After they went home they saw videos of the Coast Guard retrieving the overturned boat from the water.\n\n\"It was a nice day, the water was calm, nobody would have expected to flip over today,\" said Wyatt. He said it was a good reminder to always wear a life jacket and be safe in the water.\n\nThe whale appeared to be uninjured and the capsized boat has been salvaged, the Coast Guard wrote in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nBiddeford man pleads guilty to assaulting police at Jan. 6 Capitol riot filed under: boating, new hampshire, whales Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "sunjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lewiston Sun Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "grace_benninghoffpress_herald@sunjournal.com", "name": "Grace BenninghoffPress Herald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_bass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Striped bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biddeford,_Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biddeford, Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Biddeford, Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/07/whale-hits-boat-1721829150.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 2230, "textEnd": 2236}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Boat is currently upside down sinking.'\n\nThe coast guard communications officer can be heard repeating the information and calling for assistance as the call ends.\n\nKenney told WMUR-TV: 'He went under, he disappeared for a few minutes, and then the next thing we know, he just popped right up on our transom.'\n\nKenney and Paquette said that they had seen the whale earlier in the day and had been trying to keep their distance.\n\nPaquette added: 'When I turned, the whale's head was already landing on the engine. I look down, the boat is pitching up, the transom is going down into the water.'\n\nKenney said: 'Everything seemed like in slow motion. It was really weird.\n\n'Everyone was like, \"Oh, it was eight seconds. How'd you move so fast?'\" But it was almost slow motion, like a movie.'\n\nBrothers Colin and Wyatt Yager had been out fishing when the whale appeared, and came to the rescue of the fishermen.\n\nIn the terrifying footage, the animal can be seen bringing its nose down on the rear of the small vessel sending the two people onboard into the water\n\nThe boat was left submerged in the water following the incident, which first appeared on social media on Tuesday afternoon\n\nThe brothers managed to capture the whale smashing into the vessel and it capsizing on video.\n\nColin told the outlet: 'I had my fishing rod right here, phone in my hand and just saw it go up, and was just lucky enough to be facing the right direction.'\n\nWhile his brother added: 'I saw it come up, and I was just like, 'Oh no, it's going to hit the boat!' and then it started to flip.'\n\nAccording to a statement by the US Coast Guard, the whale was not injured in the encounter.\n\nSara Morris, of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory, said the whale was likely feeding when it came into contact with the boat.\n\nThe brothers, seen here, managed to capture the whale smashing into the vessel and it capsizing on video\n\nShe said: 'The whales are moving around underwater and coming up, potentially in an area different from where they went down, and we want to give them as much leeway as we possibly can to avoid a situation like what you see here.'\n\nWhile Orcas have been known to attack boats, humpbacks generally only approach boats when curious, rather than angry or feeling threatened.\n\nHumpbacks are generally considered gentle, although people who choose to swim with them are potentially at risk of being struck by the animal's fluke (tail) if they end up swimming into a blind spot.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday", "type":

About an hour later, the whale slammed the boat and sent two men into the water.\n\nIn an instant, Paquette and Kenney were sent into \"fight or flight\" mode, Kenney recalled hours after the scare.\n\n\"I heard a big crackle,\" said Kenney, a Dover resident. \"When that happened ... the bow tipped up and I went to the left and as (the boat) was rolling over I kind of jumped off horizontally to avoid the whale and the boat.\"\n\n\"We're glad they took such quick action,\" Paquette said of the Yager brothers. \"They didn't even think about it. We're really grateful to both of them.\"\n\nPaquette, a Groveland, Massachusetts resident, and Kenney, started their fishing expedition around 5 a.m. Tuesday, battling fog for a time before locating menhaden to use as bait to catch striped bass.\n\nThe incident comes days after a humpback whale was spotted in the Piscataqua River, and weeks following its previous appearances in extremely shallow waters in Pepperrell Cove in Kittery, Maine. It wasn't immediately known if it was the same whale.\n\n19-year-old boater shares story of whale breach and rescue\n\nWyatt Yager wasn't initially worried about the whale, as all the boats stayed along the edge of the large school of fish to allow the whale to feed, he said. But the whale moved close to one boat, breached and knocked it over.\n\nWyatt Yager estimated he and his brother, who caught the incident on video, were about 20 meters away. Colin Yager's video was widely circulated on social media Tuesday.\n\n\"I was just in shock. Everyone else had the same reaction and tried to get over to those people,\" he said. \"It was like, 'Oh shoot,' and then, 'We've got to go help these people.' All the boats dropped what they were doing to go over to help them.\"\n\nWyatt Yager, a University of Maine student, and his brother, Colin, a student at Marshwood High School, turned their boat around to go rescue the capsized boaters. The two men were in the water swimming safely, appearing uninjured, Wyatt said, and were in the water very briefly.\n\nThe men stayed in the Yagers' boat for about 15 minutes, then the brothers dropped them off at a nearby friend's vessel before the Coast Guard arrived, according to Wyatt Yager.\n\nThe brothers often see whales when they fish for tuna about 10-15 miles offshore, according to Wyatt Yager. But Tuesday's incident was by far the closest they've ever seen a whale to shore.\n\n\"If we didn't get to them, somebody else would have gotten to them 10 seconds later,\" he said. \"Everybody was trying to help.\"\n\nCoast Guard: No injuries to boaters or whale\n\nCoast Guard spokesperson Diolanda Caballero said the people ejected into the ocean were not injured and were not wearing life jackets. She confirmed they were swiftly rescued by nearby boaters.\n\nThe passengers were transported to Great Bay Marina in Newington after the whale breach, Caballero said.\n\nThe vessel struck by the whale was a 23-foot center console boat, Caballero said.\n\nThe Coast Guard received two mayday calls regarding the capsizing after the breach.", "source": {"uri": "eu.providencejournal.com", "dataType":

They saw the whole thing happen from their boat nearby.\n\n\"They were kind of laughing about it. They were in shock but they were in good spirits. They weren't completely freaked out,\" said Wyatt, 19.\n\nColin, 16, said he was enjoying the moment, watching pogies fly out of the water, looking for stripers to catch and hoping to get a video of the whale breaching.\n\n\"I fish a lot, maybe like five times a week, and I've never seen anything like that,\" he said.\n\nColin's video shows the moment the whale hit the neighboring boat. Wyatt shouts in surprise and immediately turns the boat around to rescue the men in the water.\n\nKenney and Paquette had other friends out on the water, in a bigger boat, so the brothers dropped them off and continued on with their morning.\n\n\"I thought it was just a crazy memorable experience, I'm just happy that everyone was alright so it's not a terrible memory for anyone,\" Colin said.\n\nThe boat was recovered from the water -- it ended up with a cracked engine.\n\nThe video almost immediately went viral and was quickly played around the world -- just like another whale-vs.-boat incident in the area almost exactly two years ago.\n\nThe story even attracted the attention of \"Captain\" Dave Portnoy, who himself had to be rescued by the Coast Guard last week.\n\n\"You just gotta have the feel for the ocean like I do,\" he said, likely with a smidge of irony -- he told NBC10 Boston after having to be rescued that it was his third time on a boat.\n\n\"They're not looking for you,\" Portnoy said in his commentary on the whale breach. \"You're in his living room, alright?

In the video, the breaching whale could be seen quickly coming up for are before bringing its huge body down onto the vessel.\n\nJust seconds later, a couple of people were seen being flung into the sea as the small boat was forced upward before the whale plunged back into the water.\n\nA man on another boat appeared stunned by what he witnessed and attempted to manoeuvre away from the whale. Since being uploaded, the clip has attracted an estimated 3.5 million views on the social media platform.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe, the US Coast Guard was alerted at about 8am local time amid reports that a vessel had capsized following an \"interaction with a whale.\" It is understood two people ended up in the water.\n\nNBC Boston reported ,the pair were rescued by a good Samaritan who witnessed the whale breaching. The good Samaritan then brought them to the Great Bay Marina in Portsmouth, also in New Hampshire.\n\nThe clip attacked a lot of attention on social media, with many commenting under the clip. X/Twitter account Steven Trimmer said: \"Incredible scene. But the whale is clearly under a school of baitfish next to the boat.\"\n\nUser World Hall of Fun added: \"This is, by far, one of the most spectacular things I've ever seen. So magnificent. I pray the world keeps saving the whales.\"\n\nWhile EllyKayUSA commented: \"They're just playing.

This is their home, this is their ocean.\"\n\nRyland desperately searched for Greg but couldn't see him.

Everyone else had the same reaction and tried to get over to those people,\" Wyatt told USA Today.\n\n\"It was like, 'Oh shoot,' and then, 'We've got to go help these people.' All the boats dropped what they were doing to go over to help them.\"\n\nThe humpback whale is believed to be around two-years-old. It's not clear what caused the whale to capsize the boat, but it's believed to have been feeding on fish just below the vessel.\n\nDianna Schulte, co-founder and director of research for the Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation believes that the incident was 'an accident'.\n\nShe told The Post: \"The whales will come up through schools of fish with their mouth wide open and close their mouth, either right before they break the surface or even after they break the surface.\n\n\"The boat was in the wrong place.\"\n\nShe continued: \"The boaters that are in the video, they should have known better to not be fishing with a large whale in the area, because [an accident] can happen.\n\n\"The whales, when they're feeding on the fish schools, when they're that dense, they just can't see through the fish school, so they don't know what's above them, especially on a cloudy day like today.

Biologists say the whale was likely just feeding.", "body": "A fishing boat about a mile off the coast of New Hampshire capsized on Tuesday after a humpback whale came out of the water and smashed into it, according to video of the incident.\n\nThe two men who were aboard the boat told local outlet WCVB that they hadn't seen the whale for a couple minutes when it suddenly popped up and came down on the back of the boat.\n\nThe video, which was taken by a pair of teen brothers who were on another boat nearby, showed the front of the boat abruptly tilting upwards before coming down on its side and eventually capsizing after the whale disappeared beneath the surface.\n\nOne of the men dove sideways off the boat while the other was thrown overboard, according to WCVB. Neither of them were seriously injured in the incident, with one telling the outlet: \"It's kind of a miracle that I'm alive.\"\n\nWhile some people online described the encounter as an attack by an angry whale, marine biologists saw the video differently.\n\n\"What I see is a humpback whale feeding on bait fish,\" Andrew Trites, director of the Marine Mammal Research Unit at the University of British Columbia, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nTrites noted the video showed that the whale came up with its mouth open -- a sign of feeding -- as well as some airborne fish that the humpback was likely targeting.\n\n\"So no attack by the humpback whale, just an unfortunate accident for both the whale and fisherman,\" he said, adding the whale may not have even realized the boat was there.\n\nMelanie Smith, a marine biologist and master's candidate at the University of New Hampshire, agreed that the whale appeared to be feeding.\n\nSmith, who studies humpback whale behavior, said lunging for fish is a very common behavior for the species. The humpback will typically swim straight through a school of fish or krill and open its mouth, which appeared to be what happened in the video.\n\n\"It seems like the whale was fishing, the people may have been fishing or were finishing up fishing, and it was kind of a bad place, wrong time,\" she said. \"The whale may have just misjudged where the boat was and then hit the boat.\"\n\nThe lunging behavior is different than breaching, when a whale propels itself out of the water typically with its mouth closed and can get most of its body into the air. Unlike lunging, researchers are not confident why whales breach, though one possible explanation is that it's done to communicate with other whales.\n\nAs for the humpback in the video, the whale may have been injured when it crashed into the boat. Trites said it was likely injured but that it was not possible to know if it was cut, bruised, or even fractured its jaw. According to WCVB, there were pieces of whale skin and blubber on the boat's engine cover, which was cracked.\n\nVessel collisions remain a threat to humpback whales, though typically, strikes by larger ships pose the greatest risk.\n\nThe biologists said the incident showed why it's important for boaters to maintain distance from whales, which can do serious damage to boats, even unintentionally, due to their large size.\n\n\"Hopefully, this video helps make others realize that they need to give whales space to feed rather than run the risk of having a whale come down on top of them,\" Trites said.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WCVB-TV", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WCVB-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shoaling and schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bait fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Video-showed-a-humpback-whale-smashing-into-and-capsizing-a.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

But that's what happened to somebody when a giant whale capsizes a boat. This all happened up off the coast of New Hampshire when a couple of teenagers were on a fishing trip. No, the teenagers were not the ones in the boat, but they were the ones that caught the incident on video.\n\nThey watched as a whale breached and landed on a boat near them that had people on it. Fortunately, no one was injured due to the boat capsizing. The boat was salvaged after being turned on its side. Now, if you were wondering, the whale was not injured in the incident.\n\nWatch As A Giant Whale Capsizes A Boat\n\nGregg Paquette, who was aboard the fishing boat that got overturned, said, \"We didn't see him for a couple of minutes, and then the next thing we knew, he popped up and landed right on the transom of the boat.\" It case you were wondering what type of whale it was. Well, it was a humpback whale.\n\nCheck out the video of the giant whale capsizing the boat in New Hampshire below.\n\nWhy Do Whales Breach The Water\n\nSo there isn't one general reason why whales breach the water, but there are a few theories why. The first one is the whales' breach to communicate. Their powerful splash and the sound it makes can travel great distances underwater. That allows the whales to communicate with other whales that are far away. Other reasons why are to claim their territory, to remove parasites from their body and to assist in hunting. The final one is used for visual observation. What that means is it assists whales and dolphins to get a better visual on their surroundings.", "source": {"uri": "995qyk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "995qyk.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tampa_bay@995qyk.com", "name": "Tampa Bay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "s_morning_krewe@995qyk.com", "name": "S Morning Krewe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transom_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transom (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cetacea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Watercraft", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Watercraft", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden_Boats", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Wooden Boats", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 33}], "image": "https://995qyk.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2024/07/GettyImages-590268314_1721816791_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Biologists say the whale was likely just feeding.", "body": "A humpback whale capsized a fishing boat off New Hampshire's coast, video showed. Marine biologists said the whale was likely feeding, not attacking. The humpback may have lunged for its prey and accidentally landed on the boat.\n\nA fishing boat about a mile off the coast of New Hampshire capsized on Tuesday after a humpback whale came out of the water and smashed into it, according to video of the incident.\n\nThe two men who were aboard the boat told local outlet WCVB that they hadn't seen the whale for a couple minutes when it suddenly popped up and came down on the back of the boat.\n\nThe video, which was taken by a pair of teen brothers who were on another boat nearby, showed the front of the boat abruptly tilting upwards before coming down on its side and eventually capsizing after the whale disappeared beneath the surface.\n\nOne of the men dove sideways off the boat while the other was thrown overboard, according to WCVB. Neither of them were seriously injured in the incident, with one telling the outlet: \"It's kind of a miracle that I'm alive.\"\n\nWhile some people online described the encounter as an attack by an angry whale, marine biologists saw the video differently.\n\n\"What I see is a humpback whale feeding on bait fish,\" Andrew Trites, director of the Marine Mammal Research Unit at the University of British Columbia, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nTrites noted the video showed that the whale came up with its mouth open -- a sign of feeding -- as well as some airborne fish that the humpback was likely targeting.\n\n\"So no attack by the humpback whale, just an unfortunate accident for both the whale and fisherman,\" he said, adding the whale may not have even realized the boat was there.\n\nMelanie Smith, a marine biologist and master's candidate at the University of New Hampshire, agreed that the whale appeared to be feeding.\n\nSmith, who studies humpback whale behavior, said lunging for fish is a very common behavior for the species. The humpback will typically swim straight through a school of fish or krill and open its mouth, which appeared to be what happened in the video.\n\n\"It seems like the whale was fishing, the people may have been fishing or were finishing up fishing, and it was kind of a bad place, wrong time,\" she said. \"The whale may have just misjudged where the boat was and then hit the boat.\"\n\nThe lunging behavior is different than breaching, when a whale propels itself out of the water typically with its mouth closed and can get most of its body into the air. Unlike lunging, researchers are not confident why whales breach, though one possible explanation is that it's done to communicate with other whales.\n\nAs for the humpback in the video, the whale may have been injured when it crashed into the boat. Trites said it was likely injured but that it was not possible to know if it was cut, bruised, or even fractured its jaw. According to WCVB, there were pieces of whale skin and blubber on the boat's engine cover, which was cracked.\n\nVessel collisions remain a threat to humpback whales, though typically, strikes by larger ships pose the greatest risk.\n\nThe biologists said the incident showed why it's important for boaters to maintain distance from whales, which can do serious damage to boats, even unintentionally, due to their large size.\n\n\"Hopefully, this video helps make others realize that they need to give whales space to feed rather than run the risk of having a whale come down on top of them,\" Trites said.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_orwig@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Jessica Orwig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kelsey_vlamis@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Kelsey Vlamis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bait fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Krill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoaling and schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a055492d66759f66fd9bb1?format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

They'd also seen what they believed to be the same whale, which was feeding on bait fish in the area.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, they waited for a heavy fog to clear and left Eliot, Maine, on the New Hampshire border, just after 5 a.m. in search of the schools of bait. They encountered the whale once again.\n\n\"I've tried to be as safe as possible and fish outside the bait school,\" he said. \"You don't want to be in the center of the biomass for the bait because that's likely where the whale will come up. We were on the edges -- a lot of boats weren't.\"\n\nThe whale breached several times over the course of the morning. As it moved closer in search of bait fish, the fishermen moved the boat further away.\n\nBut just as Kenney started to reel in a striped bass around 7:30 a.m., he saw the whale pop out of the water about 100 feet behind them. He kept his eyes peeled for further movement but didn't see anything. Then there was a sound.\n\n\"All of the sudden in the back of the boat I hear a rumbling of the ocean right behind the boat,\" he said.\n\nWithin moments, the whale's head popped up, its mouth open, likely trying to scoop up the bait fish it was feeding on.\n\n\"As it collapsed onto the boat, the mouth closed and smashed the top of the motor and I heard a big crunch,\" said Kenney, who still had a rod in his hand. \"I had three seconds to act. I wasn't scared; I didn't have time to be scared.\"\n\nAs the whale weighed down the stern, the bow started to rise, and Kenney had to quickly decide how to get off the boat -- if he moved too far toward the front, he risked having the entire boat capsize on him. So he edged himself to the middle until he felt the boat start to fully tip, threw his rod overboard and jumped into the water, all within a matter of seconds.\n\nThe cold North Atlantic water shocked Kenney and his breathing became labored as he realized Paquette was nowhere to be seen. Eventually Paquette popped up from under the boat in a life vest and started to swim toward Kenney. The two embraced.\n\n\"That's when I started to feel calm -- I'm with my friend, let's get to safety,\" he said.\n\nThe dramatic flip was caught on video by Colin Yager, 16, who was out fishing on another boat nearby with his brother, Wyatt. Kenney and Paquette were in the water for only a few minutes when the Yager brothers sped over to rescue them. The Yagers transferred them to the boat of a friend, who took them back to shore.\n\nIf no one had been around, Kenney said, he wasn't sure they would have survived.\n\n\"The night before it happened, my family asked if I was worried about a whale landing on the boat and I said, 'The chances of it happening are like getting struck by lightning,'\" Kenney said. \"Of course, the next day lightning strikes and a whale lands on us.\"\n\nDianna Schulte, a co-founder and director of research at the Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, confirmed the whale was a humpback likely feeding on bait fish.\n\n\"It's feeding season for many large whales, like humpbacks, who don't eat during their winter breeding season in the Caribbean. This whale wasn't 'angry' -- it was hungry,\" she wrote in a statement posted to social media. \"Boaters happened to be in the area at the same time.\"\n\n\"If you see a whale, don't approach it, or leave your fishing line in the water,\" she added. \"Lines can entangle whales, and whales can damage your boat.\"\n\nIn an email, Schulte said her group had not been able to match the whale in the video to an animal seen in those waters before.\n\nHumpback whales, often found close to shore and known for balletic breaches, are a favorite of whale watchers. They inhabit all major oceans, and during the warmer months, they spend most of their time feeding and building up fat for winter.\n\nKenney said he learned a few bait-fishing lessons Tuesday: If you think you're at a safe distance, add another 50 feet; do not leave your home port without a life vest on; and make sure other boats are nearby. The boat they were using, which belonged to Paquette's brother-in-law, was mostly unscathed but would need a new engine, he said.\n\nFor now, Kenney plans to take some time away from the water and work on his own boat.

The nerve-wracking moment in which the whale breaches and lands on the boat was caught on video.\n\n\"We didn't see him for a couple of minutes, and then the next thing we knew, he popped up and landed right on the transom of the boat,\" Gregg Paquette, who was on the boat, told WCVB. \"I just looked up and just kind of saw the boat tipping, and I said, 'The only way to avoid this is to just kind of jump horizontally away,'\" adds Ryland Kenney, the other man who was propelled into the ocean.\n\nThe clip was taken by 16-year-old Colin Yager, who was on a different boat with his brother Wyatt. After noticing the whale, he began to record, never expecting what he would capture. \"I saw it go up so I was just lucky enough to be facing the right direction,\" Yager says. \"I saw it come up, and I was just like, 'Oh, it's going to hit the boat,' and then it kind of started to flip.\"\n\nFor Paquette and Kenney, everything happened in slow motion. \"When I turned, the whale's head was already landing on the engine,\" Paquette recalls. \"So when I saw that, then all of a sudden, I look down, the boat is pitching up, the transom is going down into the water.\"\n\nLuckily, they were quickly pulled out of the water by the Yager brothers, who also got a great shot of the moment. \"Truly grateful to them,\" says Paquette. \"They were making the video, dropped everything, zoomed right over and plucked us out.\"\n\nThe Coast Guard crew from Station Portsmouth later reported that the whale appeared to be uninjured and the vessel had also been salvaged. Despite the happy ending, this is something none of the involved will soon forget. \"It's kind of a miracle that I'm alive,\" says Kenney. \"I don't know what was going through my head.

It was really weird,\" he said.\n\n\"Everyone was like, 'Oh, it was eight seconds. How'd you move so fast?' But it was almost slow motion, like a movie.\"\n\nDespite the terrifying ordeal, neither of the fishermen were hurt.\n\nBoth fishermen were also \"grateful\" for the Yager brothers' help, and consider it a \"miracle\" they survived.\n\n\"[I'm] truly grateful to them,\" said Paquette.\n\n\"They were making the video, dropped everything, zoomed right over, and plucked us out,\" he said.\n\n\"It's kind of a miracle that I'm alive,\" Kennedy added.\n\n\"I don't know what was going through my head. Just, kind of, survival.\"\n\nPaquette and Kennedy were brought to the Great Bay Marina following the crash.\n\nDespite some damage to their vessel, the US Coast Guard reported that \"the 23-foot center console boat\" was salvaged.\n\nThey also confirmed the whale did not appear to be injured as a result of the incident.\n\nThe Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation identified the whale in the video as a humpback, generally known as being gentle and peaceful.\n\nHowever, like any wild animal, humpback whales can become unpredictable - and even deadly - if they feel stressed, threatened, or otherwise agitated.\n\nWhile they normally avoid humans, the whales are also notoriously curious and often get close to boats and other vessels at sea.\n\nBarstool Sports reposted the video on their TikTok channel, where it quickly amassed over 330,000 likes.\n\n\"I'm glad someone caught this on camera because imagine having to explain this to the insurance guy,\" one user jokingly commented.\n\n\"Reason number 172893948274 why I don't fw the ocean,\" another user wrote.\n\n\"NEW FEAR UNLOCKED,\" another user commented.\n\n\"We're gonna need a bigger boat,\" another user shared, quoting the famous line from the 1975 film Jaws.\n\nSara Morris, an employee of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory, said the whale was \"likely lunge feeding\" when it crashed into the boat.\n\nLunge feeding is a strategy that involves a whale accelerating through a school of prey with its mouth closed, before opening its mouth and engulfing a large amount of water - and prey - as it slows down.\n\n\"I think one of the key things is that when whales are sighted to encourage boaters to keep their distance,\" Morris said.\n\n\"The whales are moving around underwater and coming up, potentially in an area different from where they went down, and we want to give them as much leeway as we possibly can to avoid a situation like what you see here.\"\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries New England/Mid-Atlantic shared their tips for avoiding similar incidents on their social media page.\n\n\"Recently, humpback whales have been seen feeding close to shore from Maine to Massachusetts,\" they posted on Facebook.\n\n\"In areas where baitfish are thick, humpback whales will gladly take advantage of the easy meal and may have little regard for what is on the surface, including boats.\"\n\nNOAA also confirmed that when feeding, humpback whales can become more active at the water's surface, and their behavior is increasingly \"unpredictable.\"\n\n\"Boaters are advised to steer clear of areas where whales are actively feeding to avoid entangling or colliding with a massive 80,000-pound whale as it rapidly surfaces,\" NOAA added.\n\nNOAA also advised boaters to look out for \"bubble clouds,\" which occur when humpback whales \"corral their prey.\"\n\nNot only can collisions wreck or destroy small boating vessels, but they can also cause significant injuries to boaters and whales.\n\n\"In areas where you suspect whales will be present, slowing to 10 knots helps to prevent collisions by allowing both you and the whale time to react,\" NOAA advised.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexandra_chomik@the-sun.com", "name": "Alexandra Chomik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataqua_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piscataqua River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMUR-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "WMUR-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_rod", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing rod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

I had bought tickets for the trip expecting to see a few spouts and fins through a pair of binoculars, but no, they got right up close to the giant, breaching animals. I felt whale snot sprayed on my face.\n\nYet it's good to remember that the large, whale-watching boats of the tourist trade are piloted by professionals who know exactly how to mange these experiences safely. For the private person, especially on a smaller boat, it does not pay to be in the path of a feeding whale, as these boaters recently discovered off the coast of New Hampshire.\n\nYesterday, a pair of boaters found themselves in literally deep water after a breaching whale toppled their boat and dumped them both into the ocean. Incredibly, this footage was captured by two teenagers who were on a similarly tiny craft only a few yards away. The video is pretty incredible -- as is the fact that no one was injured after this shocking incident.\n\nRelated: Whale Feeding in the Water Nearly Swallows Kayaker in Harrowing Video\n\nIn the clip, you can see a breaching whale tip over a nearby boat, dumping two passengers into the water in Portsmouth Harbor.\n\nFor Colin and Wyatt Yager, a simple fishing trip turned into a rescue mission after the nearby boat capsized. They said one man managed to jump overboard as the whale collided with the craft but that the other man was pushed under the boat as it came down.\n\nThankfully, no one was seriously injured.\n\nOne of the fishermen from the boat, Ryland Kenney, said that they had seen the whale feeding and were attempting to keep their distance, but apparently hadn't gone far enough away.\n\n\"He went under, he disappeared for a few minutes, and then the next thing we know, he just popped right up on our transom,\" he told a local news station.\n\nThough the Coast Guard reported the incident to the appropriate wildlife authorities, it is not thought that the whale itself was injured by this collision. In fact, it's possible that the giant creature never even noticed that the boat was there.\n\n\"If you look at the video really carefully, you can see that the whale has its mouth open,\" Sara Morris of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory told the press. \"It looks like it's lunge feeding and actually trying to catch fish.\"\n\nThough orcas attacking yachts have been much in the news lately, this incident appears to be entirely accidental, and it's not the first of its kind, either. Many whales swim with their mouths opening when filter feeding or trying to catch fish, as this whale was doing. A pair of kayakers in California were capsized by a feeding humpback in 2020, and a diver in Cape Cod found himself actually inside the mouth of a filter feeding humpback in 2021 (he, too, survived to tell the tale).\n\nFrom the whale's perspective, these incidents are the equivalent of stepping on an anthill or swallowing a fly. They don't mean to do it, but it can cause quite the commotion when they do.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_watching", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale watching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataqua_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Piscataqua River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swallow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orca", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orca"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diving (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoals_Marine_Laboratory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoals Marine Laboratory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_feeder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filter feeder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cape Cod"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yacht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/pethelpful_915/aded81098d0ebecab5b4f1fce18320a4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Boat is currently upside down sinking.'\n\nA Coast Guard official could be heard repeating some of the details, including that it happened around 7.45am, and advising: 'All vessels in the area are requested to keep a sharp lookout. Assist if possible.'\n\nBoth fishermen who were tossed from the vessel - Greg Paquette and Ryland Kenney - were not wearing life jackets, and managed to escape the situation unscathed.\n\nThe pair said they had spotted the giant marine animal earlier and were trying to stay away from it as they floated at the edge of a big school of fish.\n\n'When I turned, the whale's head was already landing on the engine,' Paquette told WMUR. 'So when I saw that, then all of a sudden, I look down, the boat is pitching up, the transom is going down into the water.'\n\nKenney said 'everything seemed like in slow motion'.\n\n'Everyone was like, \"Oh, it was eight seconds. How'd you move so fast?\" But it was almost slow motion, like a movie,' he told the TV station.\n\nMaine brothers Colin and Wyatt Yager also saw the whale and the former had his phone in his hand and recorded the incident.\n\nWyatt said: 'I saw it come up, and I was just like, \"Oh no, it's going to hit the boat!\" and then it started to flip.'\n\nCoast Guard officials said the whale did not appear to be injured.\n\nThe capsized vessel was able to be salvaged.\n\nIt happened more than a year-and-a-half after a mako shark jumped out of the water off the coast of Maine and onto a vessel with a group of fishermen.\n\nMORE : Protestors dump maggots at hotel and create chaos as Netanyahu defends Gaza War in US visit\n\nMORE : Fast food customer 'runs over worker for missing chicken strip and sauce'", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_kwong@metro.co.uk", "name": "Jessica Kwong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odiorne_Point_State_Park", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Odiorne Point State Park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsizing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capsizing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_War_(2008\u20132009)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza War (2008\u20132009)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transom_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transom (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shoaling and schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMUR-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WMUR-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_salvage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine salvage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fast food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living_Aboard", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living Aboard", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEC_213985250-ca22.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C2400px%2C1261px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

I had bought tickets for the trip expecting to see a few spouts and fins through a pair of binoculars, but no, they got right up close to the giant, breaching animals. I felt whale snot sprayed on my face.\n\nYet it's good to remember that the large, whale-watching boats of the tourist trade are piloted by professionals who know exactly how to mange these experiences safely. For the private person, especially on a smaller boat, it does not pay to be in the path of a feeding whale, as these boaters recently discovered off the coast of New Hampshire.\n\nYesterday, a pair of boaters found themselves in literally deep water after a breaching whale toppled their boat and dumped them both into the ocean. Incredibly, this footage was captured by two teenagers who were on a similarly tiny craft only a few yards away. The video is pretty incredible -- as is the fact that no one was injured after this shocking incident.\n\nRelated: Whale Feeding in the Water Nearly Swallows Kayaker in Harrowing Video\n\nIn the clip, you can see a breaching whale tip over a nearby boat, dumping two passengers into the water in Portsmouth Harbor.\n\nAn Accidental Collision\n\nFor Colin and Wyatt Yager, a simple fishing trip turned into a rescue mission after the nearby boat capsized. They said one man managed to jump overboard as the whale collided with the craft but that the other man was pushed under the boat as it came down.\n\nThankfully, no one was seriously injured.\n\nOne of the fishermen from the boat, Ryland Kenney, said that they had seen the whale feeding and were attempting to keep their distance, but apparently hadn't gone far enough away.\n\n\"He went under, he disappeared for a few minutes, and then the next thing we know, he just popped right up on our transom,\" he told a local news station.\n\nThough the Coast Guard reported the incident to the appropriate wildlife authorities, it is not thought that the whale itself was injured by this collision. In fact, it's possible that the giant creature never even noticed that the boat was there.\n\n\"If you look at the video really carefully, you can see that the whale has its mouth open,\" Sara Morris of the University of New Hampshire Shoals Marine Laboratory told the press. \"It looks like it's lunge feeding and actually trying to catch fish.\"\n\nYes, You Can Be Swallowed By a Whale\n\nThough orcas attacking yachts have been much in the news lately, this incident appears to be entirely accidental, and it's not the first of its kind, either. Many whales swim with their mouths opening when filter feeding or trying to catch fish, as this whale was doing. A pair of kayakers in California were capsized by a feeding humpback in 2020, and a diver in Cape Cod found himself actually inside the mouth of a filter feeding humpback in 2021 (he, too, survived to tell the tale).\n\nFrom the whale's perspective, these incidents are the equivalent of stepping on an anthill or swallowing a fly. They don't mean to do it, but it can cause quite the commotion when they do.\n\nLooking for more PetHelpful updates?

Sector issued an urgent marine information broadcast (UMIB); they directed Coast Guard Station Portsmouth Harbor to launch,\" the post read.\n\n\"A good samaritan [sic] recovered both individuals from the water.

Bravo Zulu!\" the message read.\n\nNOAA and the U.S. Coast Guard did not immediately respond to PEOPLE when approached for comment on Wednesday, July 24.\n\nPer Seacoastonline, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, the fishermen who were thrown into the water were Greg Paquette and Ryland Kenney.\n\nThe outlet stated teenage brothers Wyatt Yager, 19, and Colin Yager, 16, of Eliot, Maine, rescued the men around 8 a.m. local time. They were said to have been in the water for less than two minutes before the brothers helped them out.\n\n\"I heard a big crackle,\" said Dover, New Hampshire, resident Kenney, per the outlet. \"When that happened ... the bow tipped up and I went to the left and as (the boat) was rolling over I kind of jumped off horizontally to avoid the whale and the boat.\"\n\n\"We're glad they took such quick action,\" Paquette, of Groveland, Massachusetts, said of the two brothers who rescued them. \"They didn't even think about it. We're really grateful to both of them.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human-interest stories.\n\nRecalling how the whale's head hit the boat's engine, Kenney said, \"Then I saw the whole stern become inundated with water and I thought, 'Oh no. We're going down. We're going to sink now.' \"\n\n\"It's been an emotional day,\" Paquette said, per the outlet. \"At first there was a lot of energy and adrenaline.

They'd also seen what they believed to be the same whale, which was feeding on bait fish in the area.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, they waited for a heavy fog to clear and left Eliot, Me., on the New Hampshire border, just after 5 a.m. in search of the schools of bait. They encountered the whale once again.\n\n\"I've tried to be as safe as possible and fish outside the bait school,\" he said. \"You don't want to be in the center of the biomass for the bait because that's likely where the whale will come up. We were on the edges -- a lot of boats weren't.\"\n\nThe whale breached several times over the course of the morning. As it moved closer in search of bait fish, the fishermen moved the boat further away.\n\nBut just as Mr. Kenney started to reel in a striped bass around 7:30 a.m., he saw the whale pop out of the water about 100 feet behind them. He kept his eyes peeled for further movement but didn't see anything. Then there was a sound.\n\n\"All of the sudden in the back of the boat I hear a rumbling of the ocean right behind the boat,\" he said.\n\nWithin moments, the whale's head popped up, its mouth open, likely trying to scoop up the bait fish it was feeding on.\n\n\"As it collapsed onto the boat, the mouth closed and smashed the top of the motor and I heard a big crunch,\" said Mr. Kenney, who still had a rod in his hand. \"I had three seconds to act. I wasn't scared, I didn't have time to be scared.\"\n\nAs the whale weighed down the stern, the bow started to rise, and Mr. Kenney had to quickly decide how to get off the boat -- if he moved too far toward the front, he risked having the entire boat capsize on him. So he edged himself to the middle until he felt the boat start to fully tip, threw his rod overboard and jumped into the water, all within a matter of seconds.\n\nThe cold North Atlantic water shocked Mr. Kenney and his breathing became labored as he realized Mr. Paquette was nowhere to be seen. Eventually Mr. Paquette popped up from under the boat in a life vest and started to swim toward Mr. Kenney. The two embraced.\n\n\"That's when I started to feel calm -- I'm with my friend, let's get to safety,\" he said.\n\nThe dramatic flip was caught on video by Colin Yager, 16, who was out fishing on another boat nearby with his brother, Wyatt. Mr. Kenney and Mr. Paquette were in the water for only a few minutes when the Yager brothers sped over to rescue them. The Yagers transferred them to the boat of a friend, who took them back to shore.\n\nIf no one had been around, Mr. Kenney said, he wasn't sure they would have survived.\n\n\"The night before it happened, my family asked if I was worried about a whale landing on the boat and I said, 'The chances of it happening are like getting struck by lightening,'\" Mr. Kenney said. \"Of course, the next day lightning strikes and a whale lands on us.\"\n\nDianna Schulte, a co-founder and director of research at the Blue Ocean Society for Marine Conservation in Portsmouth, N.H., confirmed the whale was a humpback likely feeding on bait fish.\n\n\"It's feeding season for many large whales, like humpbacks, who don't eat during their winter breeding season in the Caribbean. This whale wasn't 'angry' -- it was hungry,\" she wrote in a statement posted to social media. \"Boaters happened to be in the area at the same time.\"\n\n\"If you see a whale, don't approach it, or leave your fishing line in the water,\" she added. \"Lines can entangle whales, and whales can damage your boat.\"\n\nIn an email, Ms. Schulte said her group had not been able to match the whale in the video to an animal seen in those waters before.\n\nHumpback whales, often found close to shore and known for balletic breaches, are a favorite of whale watchers. They inhabit all major oceans, and during the warmer months, they spend most of their time feeding and building up fat for winter.\n\nMr. Kenney said he learned a few bait-fishing lessons on Tuesday: If you think you're at a safe distance, add another 50 feet; do not leave your home port without a life vest on; and make sure other boats are nearby. The boat they were using, which belonged to Mr. Paquette's brother-in-law, was mostly unscathed but would need a new engine, he said.\n\nFor now, Mr. Kenney plans to take some time away from the water and work on his own boat. As luck would have it, he ordered a new tool in the days before Tuesday's episode: a sophisticated radar system -- one that can alert the proximity of whales.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bait fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_bait", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing bait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomass", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Biomass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_bass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Striped bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_reel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fishing reel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_port", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_watching", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whale watching"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fishing line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth,_New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth, New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Safety", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living_Aboard", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living Aboard", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Whale-Capsizes-Fishing-Boat-Off-New-Hampshire-Coast.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Biologists say the whale was likely just feeding.", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nThe video, which was taken by a pair of teen brothers who were on another boat nearby, showed the front of the boat abruptly tilting upwards before coming down on its side and eventually capsizing after the whale disappeared beneath the surface.\n\nOne of the men dove sideways off the boat while the other was thrown overboard, according to WCVB. Neither of them were seriously injured in the incident, with one telling the outlet: \"It's kind of a miracle that I'm alive.\"\n\nWhile some people online described the encounter as an attack by an angry whale, marine biologists saw the video differently.\n\n\"What I see is a humpback whale feeding on bait fish,\" Andrew Trites, director of the Marine Mammal Research Unit at the University of British Columbia, told Business Insider in an email.\n\nTrites noted the video showed that the whale came up with its mouth open -- a sign of feeding -- as well as some airborne fish that the humpback was likely targeting.\n\n\"So no attack by the humpback whale, just an unfortunate accident for both the whale and fisherman,\" he said, adding the whale may not have even realized the boat was there.\n\nMelanie Smith, a marine biologist and master's candidate at the University of New Hampshire, agreed that the whale appeared to be feeding.\n\nSmith, who studies humpback whale behavior, said lunging for fish is a very common behavior for the species. The humpback will typically swim straight through a school of fish or krill and open its mouth, which appeared to be what happened in the video.\n\n\"It seems like the whale was fishing, the people may have been fishing or were finishing up fishing, and it was kind of a bad place, wrong time,\" she said. \"The whale may have just misjudged where the boat was and then hit the boat.\"\n\nThe lunging behavior is different than breaching, when a whale propels itself out of the water typically with its mouth closed and can get most of its body into the air. Unlike lunging, researchers are not confident why whales breach, though one possible explanation is that it's done to communicate with other whales.\n\nAs for the humpback in the video, the whale may have been injured when it crashed into the boat. Trites said it was likely injured but that it was not possible to know if it was cut, bruised, or even fractured its jaw. According to WCVB, there were pieces of whale skin and blubber on the boat's engine cover, which was cracked.\n\nVessel collisions remain a threat to humpback whales, though typically, strikes by larger ships pose the greatest risk.\n\nThe biologists said the incident showed why it's important for boaters to maintain distance from whales, which can do serious damage to boats, even unintentionally, due to their large size.\n\n\"Hopefully, this video helps make others realize that they need to give whales space to feed rather than run the risk of having a whale come down on top of them,\" Trites said.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_orwig@businessinsider.com", "name": "Jessica Orwig", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kelsey_vlamis@businessinsider.com", "name": "Kelsey Vlamis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miracle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Krill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shoaling and schooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bait fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_Hampshire", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of New Hampshire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fisherman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_British_Columbia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of British Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blubber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blubber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/66a056552d66759f66fd9bd2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

I was hoping he or she would get super active, and then within an hour, the whale threw its tail, and the gear came off. It was breaching and pec-slapping non-stop.\"\n\n\"The whole team was elated,\" he said, adding he got goosebumps and everyone was cheering and high-fiving. \"It was a huge relief. It doesn't happen all the time.\"\n\nFor days, the team, including another vessel that operated a drone to provide footage to study the entanglement above and below the water's surface and a third Newport Beach-based catamaran that carried supplies, had been trailing the whale after it was first spotted off Redondo Beach and again off Rancho Palos Verdes on July 13.\n\nCharter boats spotted the whale along the Orange County coast over the following several days and Viezbicke made two attempts at slicing the fishing line on Thursday; one just missed the line, and the second time, the knife bounced over the line, he said.\n\nThen on Friday, right around 2:30 p.m., three miles off Dana Point Headlands, Viezbicke struck gold. The whale reappeared, and after slowly following it Viezbicke made his final and successful cut when the animal rose high enough that its tail was out of the water.\n\n\"It was the first shot, and I got him,\" he said.\n\nFreeing a whale is difficult and dangerous and can only be done by teams trained and authorized by NOAA. Often, the boat attaches itself to the whale's gear to try and slow it down and crews may attach buoys to further slow the animal so it can be approached to determine the amount of entanglement and course of action.\n\n\"It took a lot of patience until we got lucky, and the whale came up to the boat,\" Viezbicke said, adding that the whale was entirely wrapped up on both sides of his fluke blade. \"Typically, we like to attach ourselves and get towed by the whale. In this case, the boat was running and trying to time getting close to the whale. It was challenging to get the knife near the line when the whale was at the surface.\"\n\nHe said the rescue teams, which included help from the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach and a new group called Entangled Whale Response of Orange County, were lucky because the whale continued to stay in a localized area between Newport Beach, Laguna Beach and Dana Point.\n\nThis was the fourth humpback whale confirmed entangled off the California coast this year. Two gray whales were also reported entangled in fishing gear.\n\nViezbicke said the gear taken off the whale had two small buoys, but there are no markings to indicate which fishery it's from.\n\nHe said he would speak with state Fish and Wildlife officials and fishermen to better understand where the gear could have come from. He'll also contact whale experts to determine where the animal might have been swimming in the last six months.\n\n\"My guess is that (the gear) has been on there for three to six months and probably a lot more if it,\" Viezbicke said. \"Over time, it's probably gotten pieces off. If we didn't get it (all) off, it would have sliced its fluke off. There was about a foot cut into the leading edge of the right fluke.\"\n\nThe whale's injuries are still a concern, Viezbicke said on Monday, but he was optimistic it would continue to recover and added that he'd gotten reports from boat captains that the animal was still sticking around and seemed to be acting more normal.\n\nMark Girardeau, a nature photographer aboard Newport Coastal Adventure, photographed the whale off Newport Beach over the weekend.\n\nCapt. Steve Burkhalter said the whale was back off the Dana Point Headlands when he saw it Monday, July 22, and it was swimming and feeding with a pod of long-beaked common dolphins. On Tuesday, the whale was still cruising south and was sighted about four miles off San Clemente.\n\n\"It looked comfortable and was taking normal breaths,\" said Burkhalter, who has taken to calling the whale Freedom.\n\n\"This entanglement team worked so hard, it's cool to see that the system worked,\" he said. \"Sometimes we don't see that.\"\n\nIn the end, Viezbicke threw back credit to Burkhalter and all the other whale-watching charter captains, who he said were instrumental to the happy ending.\n\n\"This was a cool one because we put so much effort into it,\" Viezbicke said. \"It reinforced what we're doing and gives the community confidence that we'll put in the needed time.\"", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erika_i_ritchie@ocregister.com", "name": "Erika I.

Only a small portion of our enormous seas have been surveyed, meaning there is still plenty to learn about the marine life and behaviour of marine animals. The fascination surrounding the water has increased due to a recent viral video that shows a humpback whale in a rare and dramatic moment.\n\nHumpback Whale Attack Goes Viral\n\nOn July 23, a humpback whale was unexpectedly sighted in the Piscataqua River, which borders New Hampshire and Maine in the US. The whale's sudden appearance was already astonishing, but what happened next was truly extraordinary. The massive whale leaped out of the water and landed directly on a boat carrying two fishermen.\n\nFishermen Thrown Overboard\n\nThe fishermen were thrown into the river when the boat overturned due to the whale's powerful leap. Both fisherman were saved and are said to be in good health thanks to the prompt action of adjacent boaters. The whale continued swimming unharmed despite the startling event.\n\nSocial Media Reactions\n\nThe video of the whale's leap has gone viral, sparking a flurry of reactions on social media. One user on X (formerly Twitter) remarked, \"The boat attacked the whale, actually.\" Another commented, \"No way I'll ever go fishing again.\" A third user joked, \"Was the whale after the boat or the captain?\" While a fourth quipped, \"Nope!

Kenney said he heard \"a big crunch\" as the whale landed on the boat's engine and then slid off toward the port side, submerging part of the boat underwater before it eventually capsized.\n\nThe shocking whale drama was caught on video by two teenagers who were fishing nearby and then jumped into action to rescue Paquette and Kenney from the water. Nobody was injured, and officials said it appeared the whale was also not hurt.\n\n\"The thing I remember the most is the power in the weight of the whale hitting the back of the boat and driving it down,\" said Paquette, 54, of Groveland, Mass. \"You see it in the video, but when you feel it, just the shock running through the boat, and watching the back sink, that was the thing that left the biggest impression.\"\n\nThe two men have been friends for about 10 years after meeting through work and bonding over their shared love of fishing. Paquette said they get out on the water together on a near weekly basis, and Kenney said the fishing on Tuesday was the best he'd ever seen as they hooked numerous striped bass that morning.\n\nPaquette said the boat, a 21-foot Parker center console, is owned by his father-in-law, and the two friends set out early Tuesday morning from a dock in Eliot, Maine, to do some fishing before work.\n\nKenney said he had also gone out with another friend on Monday and reeled in 13 fish. During that trip, he saw a whale breach close to some other boats and took pictures. Little did he know he'd get a closer look when he returned to the water on Tuesday.\n\nThe two men, along with several other people fishing in the area, came upon a school of pogies and positioned their boat near the edge of the area where the fish had congregated. Paquette said they'd been on the water for about two hours and were aware that a whale was nearby but said they were trying to maintain a safe distance.\n\nPaquette said he noticed the whale swim away about 100 yards and then went into a dive.\n\n\"He was gone for a couple minutes, and that's when two minutes later he pops up and lands on our transom,\" Paquette said.\n\nPaquette said he was holding the net and staring down at the water, waiting for Ryland's fish to come up when the whale appeared behind them and he heard Kenney shout, \"Whoa!\"\n\n\"I look back and saw the whale's head crash down on the engine,\" Paquette said.\n\nThe force of the whale's weight submerged the boat's stern, and the vessel started to take on water as its bow pointed up in the air.\n\n\"At that point, I'm thinking we're not getting out of this,\" Paquette said. \"We're either going to sink or we're going to capsize.\"\n\nAs the whale began to slide off, the boat turned on its edge.\n\n\"The boat started rolling and at that point I was basically in fight or flight mode,\" Kenney said. \"I was like, 'I'm not fighting my way out of this one, I just gotta get the heck out of here.'\"\n\nKenney said he dove into the water before the boat could roll on top of him. Meanwhile, Paquette, who was closer to the bow, was thrown in by the force of the motion and narrowly avoided being caught underneath the boat as it turned over.\n\n\"Fortunately, my life jacket inflated and I was able to sort of crawl my way out . . . and get out from under the front before it fully capsized,\" Paquette said.\n\nKenney didn't have his lifejacket -- it was on his own boat -- and the cold water shocked him, making it difficult for him to catch his breath.\n\n\"One of the big takeaways for me is I'm not leaving the dock without a lifejacket . . . because you never know what's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nKenney said he tried to calm himself down. At the same time, he was searching for his friend.\n\n\"That was probably the scariest moment, not knowing where Greg was,\" Kenney said.\n\nHe feared that Paquette was trapped underneath and was relieved when his friend resurfaced a moment later.\n\n\"Once we met each other, we ensured we were okay,\" Kenney said.\n\nPaquette told Kenney to grab onto him, and just a few seconds later, teenage brothers Colin and Wyatt Yager pulled their boat up alongside and brought them on board.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsizing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capsizing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groveland,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groveland, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Groveland, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dover", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dover"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dover"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transom_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transom (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bow and arrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_bass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Striped bass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot,_Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eliot, Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eliot, Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbidae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living_Aboard", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating/Living Aboard", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/CnQ40C3joGltShduW0YTDnIm7CI=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/UOTS6XIYUJFQTFUP6P6ZAWH4TY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Tuesday morning, officials confirmed.\n\nThe Coast Guard responded to two mayday calls reporting a capsized boat about half a nautical mile east of Odiorne Point State Park, near Portsmouth.\n\nThose ejected into the water said they were near Gunboat Shoals at around 7:30 a.m. when a breaching whale slammed into their boat without warning.\n\n\"It's was a harrowing experience, but you can see from the video exactly what happened. The whale came up, landed on our transom, the boat kind of came up like this, the front's in the air, and then turned over,\" said boater Greg Paquette.\n\nPaquette said fellow boater Ryland Kenney jumped out before the boat had fully flipped over.\n\n\"And so, he leapt away from boat as it was going sideways, and I was kind of underneath the front of the boat,\" Paquette said.\n\nHis lifejacket inflated and he crawled out from underneath the vessel, Paquette said.\n\n\"I'll tell you, we were lucky, we were really lucky,\" he said.\n\nKenney said the whole ordeal happened in the span of a few seconds.\n\n\"I was probably about 3 feet from the whale's head, and I saw him come up and open his mouth, I think that's when I was like 'whoa' and his mouth closed and it crunched the engine,\" Kenney said.\n\n\"Like Greg said, the bow went up, and it started tilting over, and I kind of didn't know what to do. I was kind of on the side when the boat was coming up, kind of 'Superman'd' off the side of the boat and just went in,\" he continued.\n\nThe two passengers were helped out of the water by people on another boat, according to a statement from the Coast Guard.

The chances of a close encounter with a whale were about the same as getting hit by lightning, he said.\n\nKenney was out fishing about two miles off the coast with his friend Greg Paquette, who is 54 and from Groveland, Mass., in a 23-foot boat. New Hampshire's 13-mile coastline is a fertile feeding ground for fish -- and whales -- because freshwater flowing from the Piscataqua River meets the salty Atlantic, bringing an abundance of species.\n\nFor the same reason, there were lots of boats out on Tuesday, and the friends were conscious about maintaining a safe distance from other boats to avoid collisions.\n\nThen they spotted Kenney's old friend, the same juvenile humpback whale that he'd shown his mother, in the water. They tried to keep the boat at least 50 feet away from the animal.\n\n\"But obviously, we weren't far enough,\" Kenney said over Zoom.\n\nThe humpback was swimming around below the pair in the boat. Then it abruptly splashed above the surface, apparently in pursuit of prey.\n\nPaquette had his back turned to the engine at the rear and didn't realize what was happening. But Kenney saw it all. He \"yelled something like 'whoa,' like he had seen the whale come out of the water,\" Paquette said, sitting next to Kenney and recounting the incident for a reporter.\n\nKenney had in fact seen the whale come out of the water. The whale's \"mouth was wide open. And as he came down, his mouth closed and basically you could hear a crunch. And he had crunched the engine,\" he said.\n\nBy the time Paquette turned his head, the whale was already on its way crashing down to the engine. Seconds later ocean water quickly flooded the boat's stern.\n\nMoments later, as the boat began to roll to its side, Kenney said he jumped straight out to get away from the tipping boat. \"I kind of cleared the boat and got away from it,\" he said.\n\nPaquette, meanwhile, was thrown into the water. He quickly got out of the way before the boat could land on him.\n\nPaquette had his life jacket on. Kenney did not. Kenney briefly had difficulty breathing because of the water's 55-degree temperature.\n\nLuckily for the two, brothers Wyatt and Colin Yager were on a nearby boat and saw the whole thing.\n\nColin, 16, recorded the episode on his phone, telling a local ABC affiliate that he was \"just lucky enough to be facing in that direction.\"\n\nWyatt Yager, 19, who was steering the boat, said he saw the whale come out of the water. He quickly guided his boat toward Kenney and Paquette, and helped pull them out.\n\nThe men were not hurt, and the whale also appeared uninjured, the Coast Guard said.\n\nKenney and Paquette say they won't give up fishing -- but they are motivated to be more cautious.\n\n\"Everything is fluid out there,\" Paquette said. \"Everything is moving ... you have the fish moving, the whales are moving, the water is moving, the boats are moving.\"\n\nKenney said he'd be staying closer to the coast for the next few weeks and ensuring that there are other boats nearby in case of another emergency. He also said he would remember to wear his life jacket.\n\n\"Can lightning strike again? I don't want to take that chance. So for me, I'm going to be a little more cautious,\" Kenney said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_jeong@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Andrew Jeong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_whale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Humpback whale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piscataqua_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piscataqua River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fresh water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Hampshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groveland,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Groveland, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Groveland, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swimming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Boating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Watercraft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/07-24-2024/t_8cc4dec96abd400e824bab6ddcf276c4_name_whale.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9757609", "eventUri": "eng-9757609", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

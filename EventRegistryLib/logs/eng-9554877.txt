When her 11-hour flight landed, she said it looked like her wheelchair had been folded in half.\n\nThe custom chair is critical, and isn't easily replaced. \"It's not a suitcase, it's an extension of my body,\" she said.\n\nThat incident garnered national media attention at the time, and she is far from alone.\n\nOn Thursday, Ziv was in Ottawa to take part in a national summit on air accessibility.\n\nShe's a disability advocate and founder of a tech company called Access Now, which provides information about the accessibility of businesses around the world. She says there are a lot of problems airlines need to solve to make travel adequate for all.\n\n\"There is a lack of understanding of the importance that a mobility device plays in the world of a person with a disability,\" Ziv said.\n\nShe said the current solutions are responses to problems that wouldn't exist if places like airports and plans were designed to include people with disabilities.\n\nPart of the issue: decisions in the travel industry are primarily made by people who are able-bodied, and she said that often leads to inaccurate assumptions about who is fit to travel.\n\nLiberal ministers told reporters on Thursday that the industry has agreed to make some changes.\n\n\"All partners agreed to seek out ways to ensure seamless travel for persons with disabilities,\" said Kamal Khera, the federal minister for people with disabilities.\n\nThat includes an agreement to create a streamlined and standardized intake form at the booking stage for people who need accessibility support.\n\nKhera gave the airlines credit for recognizing that there are problems.\n\nTransport Minister Pablo Rodriguez said the changes need to be implemented as soon as possible, though he stopped short of setting a deadline or promising penalties for non-compliance.\n\n\"The airline companies don't want to be in the papers because of bad services,\" he said.\n\nBut that has consistently been the case in recent years and it was, in part, negative media coverage that led to Thursday's summit.\n\nIt was announced in March after airline executives testified at the House transport committee, where MPs confronted them with shocking stories from people with disabilities about the way the airlines treated them.\n\nAmong the incidents: Air Canada had left the country's chief accessibility officer's wheelchair behind on a cross-country flight. Another wheelchair user was forced to drag himself off a plane when it landed.\n\nLast year, the Canadian Paralympic Committee demanded better transport to and from competitions after athletes complained of damaged and broken equipment.\n\nAir Canada said it formed an advisory committee early this year made up of customers with disabilities and set out a program for travellers to wear a lanyard that indicates to staff they may need assistance.\n\nAt Thursday's summit, airline representatives touted their successes, with one saying that passenger surveys showed the overwhelming majority of travellers who need special assistance have positive experiences.\n\nReporters were granted access to the summit on the condition that they did not directly quote what participants said during the event, outside of interviews.\n\nZiv said it's good to see the federal government taking the issue more seriously.\n\n\"What were seeing from the ministers today is some actual demands for progress, accountability, real timelines and eventually, standards.\"\n\nBut she said that shouldn't have to happen for airlines to take action.\n\n\"They can (improve) if they want to,\" she said. \"The airlines can make decisions without government getting involved.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.\n\nSimon Hopkins, The Canadian Press", "source": {"uri":

A government release (new window) said the discussions will address the effectiveness of regulations meant to ensure accessibility.\n\nThis summit offers us a chance to listen and to learn from the lived experiences of passengers with disabilities so that collectively we can create concrete solutions, Khera said Thursday in her opening remarks to the summit.\n\nAirlines have taken heat in recent months over reports of passengers with disabilities being left to deplane without assistance, and of airlines misplacing vital equipment, such as wheelchairs.\n\nOn his way into Parliament Wednesday Rodriguez told CBC News airlines are coming to the summit in good faith to have those honest conversations. He said he's looking for concrete solutions to a situation he called not acceptable.\n\nAsked how he will ensure airlines fulfil their responsibilities, Rodriguez said Wednesday that there could be penalties, it could be serious consequences. All of that will be decided after this summit.\n\nThe CEOs of Canada's major airlines were called to appear before a parliamentary committee probing the state of accessible transportation.\n\nThe House of Commons transport committee held four meetings (new window) on the subject and will be delivering a draft report in the coming months.\n\nNDP MP Taylor Bachrach, the party's transport critic, told CBC News Thursday morning that he is hoping to see a commitment from the minister that he will do what's required to ensure that Canada's air sector will be more accessible after the summit.\n\nWe've heard from leading disability advocates about the barriers they face. Now what's required is political will from the minister, he said.\n\nIt was Bachrach's motion at the House of Commons Transport Committee that led to the study of accessibility. He says ensuring people living with disabilities can travel with dignity is a human rights issue.\n\nWe need better data, better regulations and proper enforcement, he said.\n\nAfter Rodriguez and Khera made their opening remarks, they hosted the first of two panel discussions. Participants in the first panel included representatives from the CNIB, the Autism Alliance of Canada, Procne Navigation, Spinal Cord Injury Canada, Wavefront Centre for Communication Accessibility and the Vancouver International Airport.\n\nJoanne Smith of Spinal Cord Injury Canada said it was important for her to be at the summit because she has seen a noticeable decline in accessibility service and safety when travelling with a mobility impairment.\n\nIt's undignifying, it's humiliating. We should be able to travel for work and pleasure and not have to have this kind of treatment, she told CBC News.\n\nSmith said she's been dropped by airline staff and has dealt with staff members who were improperly trained.\n\nBaseline, we need enhanced education, training and communication, she said. But underneath that, even more importantly, we need a shift in attitudes. There seems to be a fear or a lack of awareness of working with the disabled community.\n\nMaayan Ziv is founder and CEO of AccessNow and a disability activist. She told CBC News the first session with advocates was useful.\n\nIt was really great to show both ministers show sincerity and acknowledge the very real barriers that Canadians with disabilities are experiencing. It wasn't sugarcoated, she said.\n\nThe inconsistency in service for passengers with disabilities was a constant theme in the session, Ziv said.\n\nSometimes you might have a good flight, other times you're facing tremendous anxiety because your needs are overlooked, she said.\n\nWestJet chief executive officer Alexis von Hoensbroech apologized for the incidents in February, saying he hoped to improve travel accessibility.\n\nTo our guests who didn't have a good travel experience with us, we are sincerely sorry and we are committed [to] doing better, von Hoensbroech said (new window) during an appearance before the transport committee.\n\nAir Canada's CEO Michael Rousseau also faced tough questions at the committee over reports of passenger mistreatment during the past year.\n\nWe do make mistakes, Rousseau told the committee. He pointed to an expedited accessibility scheme announced in November, along with new measures to improve the travel experience passengers living with a disability.\n\nThe parliamentary hearings followed several CBC News stories reporting incidents of mistreatment.\n\nIn one case, the federal government's chief accessibility officer, Stephanie Cadieux, flew from Toronto to Vancouver in October on an Air Canada flight only to discover that her wheelchair had been left behind.\n\nCadieux said that while her chair was safely returned to her by the airline the following morning, airlines that do not provide appropriate care and attention to essential equipment like wheelchairs leave travellers vulnerable.\n\nI want everyone to understand that when a person's wheelchair is lost, so is their independence, safety, mobility and dignity, she said.\n\nAirlines have to take responsibility and they have to do better.\n\nAt the opening of the summit Thursday, Rodriguez said the Liberal government wants to make Canada a world leader in accessible air travel.\n\nWe can't treat a wheelchair like luggage, it simply isn't luggage, Rodriguez added. That's why today we are here ensuring we build a better transportation system.\n\nWATCH:Man forced to drag himself off Air Canada flight vows to keep fighting\n\nAir Canada has apologized to a B.C. man after staff told him he would need to get to the front of the plane without any assistance. The airline has also admitted it violated Canadian disability legislation. Rodney Hodgins hopes the situation will lead to systemic change.\n\nRodney and Deanna Hodgins flew from Vancouver to Las Vegas in late August to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Rodney has spastic cerebral palsy and uses a motorized wheelchair.\n\nThey say he was forced to drag himself (new window) off an Air Canada flight in Las Vegas after the airline failed to provide the assistance he needed to safely exit the plane. Deanna called the experience dehumanizing.\n\nYou are watching this man grab the back of a chair and then struggle and fight while I'm on the ground, crawling on the ground moving his legs, and we're trying to get him to the front of the plane. I'm fighting his spasms trying to lift up his legs, she said.\n\nRyan Lachance, a White Rock-based stand-up comedian who has quad spastic cerebral palsy and uses a motorized wheelchair, said that in May 2023, he was dropped and injured while attempting to exit an Air Canada flight after the airline's crew failed to bring the equipment he needed.\n\nIt was a massive struggle to get me out of the seat. I travel with a sling underneath me to make it easier for people to pick me up. They kept pulling that and it was hurting my body, bruising my back and my hip really bad, he said.\n\nEmma Proulx, Lachance's care assistant, was travelling with him at the time. She said it was painful to watch and it was painful for Ryan to experience.\n\nThe second panel features representatives from airlines and airports, including the National Airlines Council of Canada, the Canadian Airports Council, the Northern Air Transport Association, Air Canada, WestJet, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Canadian Labour Congress, UNIFOR and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.", "source": {"uri": "ici.radio-canada.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Canada"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zone_politique@ici.radio-canada.ca", "name": "Zone Politique", "type":

She says there are a lot of problems airlines need to solve to make travel adequate for all. \"There is a lack of understanding of the importance that a mobility device plays in the world of a person with a disability,\" Ziv said. She said the current solutions are responses to problems that wouldn't exist if places like airports and plans were designed to include people with disabilities. Part of the issue: decisions in the travel industry are primarily made by people who are able-bodied, and she said that often leads to inaccurate assumptions about who is fit to travel. Liberal ministers told reporters on Thursday that the industry has agreed to make some changes. \"All partners agreed to seek out ways to ensure seamless travel for persons with disabilities,\" said Kamal Khera, the federal minister for people with disabilities. That includes an agreement to create a streamlined and standardized intake form at the booking stage for people who need accessibility support. Khera gave the airlines credit for recognizing that there are problems. Transport Minister Pablo Rodriguez said the changes need to be implemented as soon as possible, though he stopped short of setting a deadline or promising penalties for non-compliance. \"The airline companies don't want to be in the papers because of bad services,\" he said. But that has consistently been the case in recent years and it was, in part, negative media coverage that led to Thursday's summit. It was announced in March after airline executives testified at the House transport committee, where MPs confronted them with shocking stories from people with disabilities about the way the airlines treated them. Among the incidents: Air Canada had left the country's chief accessibility officer's wheelchair behind on a cross-country flight. Another wheelchair user was forced to drag himself off a plane when it landed. Last year, the Canadian Paralympic Committee demanded better transport to and from competitions after athletes complained of damaged and broken equipment. Air Canada said it formed an advisory committee early this year made up of customers with disabilities and set out a program for travellers to wear a lanyard that indicates to staff they may need assistance. At Thursday's summit, airline representatives touted their successes, with one saying that passenger surveys showed the overwhelming majority of travellers who need special assistance have positive experiences. Reporters were granted access to the summit on the condition that they did not directly quote what participants said during the event, outside of interviews. Ziv said it's good to see the federal government taking the issue more seriously. \"What were seeing from the ministers today is some actual demands for progress, accountability, real timelines and eventually, standards.\" But she said that shouldn't have to happen for airlines to take action. \"They can (improve) if they want to,\" she said. \"The airlines can make decisions without government getting involved.\" This report by The Canadian Press was first published May 9, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wheelchair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Pearson_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Pearson International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_travel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air travel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Rodriguez_(Canadian_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pablo Rodriguez (Canadian politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamal_Khera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamal Khera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Transport_(Canada)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Transport (Canada)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_rights_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability rights movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Paralympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Paralympic Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Canada"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Transportation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://medicinehatnews.com/wp-content/uploads/cp/20240509120540-18ef3dcb52646377573e180afda89e434c84735aa4b4f985643299a9eeacb98f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554877", "eventUri": "eng-9554877", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-11-", "textStart": 85, "textEnd": 92}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

ET.\n\nThe summit will hear from airline representatives and the disability community. A government release said the discussions will address the effectiveness of regulations meant to ensure accessibility.\n\n\"All Canadians expect airlines to do a lot better in the way that they treat persons with disabilities,\" Khera said Wednesday on her way into Parliament.\n\nAirlines have taken heat in recent months over reports of passengers with disabilities being left to deplane without assistance, and of airlines misplacing vital equipment, such as wheelchairs.\n\nRodriguez told CBC News airlines are coming to the summit \"in good faith to have those honest conversations.\" He said he's looking for concrete solutions to a situation he called \"not acceptable.\"\n\nAsked how he will ensure airlines fulfil their responsibilities, Rodriguez said Wednesday that \"there could be penalties, it could be serious consequences. All of that will be decided after this summit.\"\n\nThe CEOs of Canada's major airlines were called to appear before a parliamentary committee probing the state of accessible transportation.\n\nThe House of Commons transport committee held four meetings on the subject and will be delivering a draft report in the coming months.\n\nWestJet chief executive officer Alexis von Hoensbroech apologized for the incidents in February, saying he hoped to improve travel accessibility.\n\n\"To our guests who didn't have a good travel experience with us, we are sincerely sorry and we are committed [to] doing better,\" von Hoensbroech said during an appearance before the transport committee.\n\nAir Canada's CEO Michael Rousseau also faced tough questions at the committee over reports of passenger mistreatment during the past year.\n\n\"We do make mistakes,\" Rousseau told the committee. He pointed to an expedited accessibility scheme announced in November, along with new measures to improve the travel experience passengers living with a disability.\n\nThe parliamentary hearings followed several CBC News stories reporting incidents of mistreatment.\n\nIn one case, the federal government's chief accessibility officer, Stephanie Cadieux, flew from Toronto to Vancouver in October on an Air Canada flight only to discover that her wheelchair had been left behind.\n\nCadieux said that while her chair was safely returned to her by the airline the following morning, airlines that do not provide appropriate care and attention to essential equipment like wheelchairs leave travellers vulnerable.\n\n\"I want everyone to understand that when a person's wheelchair is lost, so is their independence, safety, mobility and dignity,\" she said.\n\n\"Airlines have to take responsibility and they have to do better.\"\n\nRodney and Deanna Hodgins flew from Vancouver to Las Vegas in late August to celebrate their first wedding anniversary. Rodney has spastic cerebral palsy and uses a motorized wheelchair.\n\nThey say he was forced to drag himself off an Air Canada flight in Las Vegas after the airline failed to provide the assistance he needed to safely exit the plane. Deanna called the experience \"dehumanizing.\"\n\n\"You are watching this man grab the back of a chair and then struggle and fight while I'm on the ground, crawling on the ground moving his legs, and we're trying to get him to the front of the plane. I'm fighting his spasms trying to lift up his legs,\" she said.\n\nRyan Lachance, a White Rock-based stand-up comedian who has quad spastic cerebral palsy and uses a motorized wheelchair, said that in May 2023, he was dropped and injured while attempting to exit an Air Canada flight after the airline's crew failed to bring the equipment he needed.\n\n\"It was a massive struggle to get me out of the seat. I travel with a sling underneath me to make it easier for people to pick me up. They kept pulling that and it was hurting my body, bruising my back and my hip really bad,\" he said.\n\nEmma Proulx, Lachance's care assistant, was travelling with him at the time. She said \"it was painful to watch and it was painful for Ryan to experience.\"\n\nAccording to an itinerary distributed to the media, Rodriguez and Khera will make opening remarks at the summit before hosting two discussion panels.\n\nParticipants in the first panel include representatives from the CNIB, the Autism Alliance of Canada, Procne Navigation, Spinal Cord Injury Canada, Wavefront Centre for Communication Accessibility and the Vancouver International Airport.\n\nThe second panel features representatives from airlines and airports, including the National Airlines Council of Canada, the Canadian Airports Council, the Northern Air Transport Association, Air Canada, WestJet, the Canadian Union of Public Employees, the Canadian Labour Congress, UNIFOR and the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki",

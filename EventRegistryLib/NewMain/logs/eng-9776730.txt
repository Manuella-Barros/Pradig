(Reuters)\n\nSudan's government conditionally accepted on Tuesday an invitation to attend US-sponsored peace talks in Geneva, raising hopes that the talks could advance efforts to end a 15-month-old war.\n\nThe government is aligned with the army in its war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The army has shunned recent bids to restart ceasefire or peace negotiations, with Islamists who hold sway in its ranks calling for a military victory.\n\nThe Geneva talks would be the first major effort in months to get the army and the RSF to sit together. The RSF accepted the US invitation soon after they were proposed last week.\n\n\"The government said (in its reply to the invitation) that it was the party most concerned with saving the lives and dignity of the Sudanese people, and so it will cooperate with any entity that aims to do so,\" the Sudanese foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe war has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis with a fifth of the population displaced and famine likely across the country. Previous talks convened by the United States and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah broke up without agreement.\n\nThe RSF, which clashed with the army over plans to integrate their forces last year, has taken control of eight of Sudan's 18 state capitals, including the capital Khartoum, and is expanding further into the southeast of the country.\n\n\"The government made clear that any negotiations before ... full withdrawal and an end to expansion (by the RSF) will not be acceptable to the Sudanese people,\" the statement said. However, it also requested meetings with US officials to discuss the agenda for the talks.\n\nUS special envoy Tom Perriello told reporters on Monday both sides had been receptive to offers of meetings in advance of formal talks. A planned meeting in the army's de facto capital Port Sudan was cancelled but would hopefully be rescheduled, he said.\n\nThe talks would be co-hosted by Saudi Arabia and would include Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, according to UN experts, US officials, and the Sudanese army.\n\nArmy chief Abdelfattah al-Burhan recently spoke on the phone with the UAE's Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed for the first time since the outbreak of the war.\n\n\"We think actually having UAE at the talks gives it a better chance for it to be a real peace deal and one that can be enforced,\" Perriello said.", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AW"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thearabweekly.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image_800x450_/public/2024-07/2024-07-31_12-40-55_505008.jpg?itok=M0Gcuuqj", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776730", "eventUri": "eng-9776730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The attack killed five people and came amid renewed peace talks. Burhan vowed to continue the fight, refuting RSF's alleged involvement.\n\nSudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan struck a defiant tone on Wednesday after a drone hit an army base he was visiting in eastern Sudan, casting doubt on recent efforts to bring an end to a 15-month civil war. A statement by the army said the attack took place at a graduation ceremony at the Gibeit army base, about 100 km (62 miles) from the army's de facto capital Port Sudan in Sudan's Red Sea state, and that five people were killed.\n\nWitnesses confirmed that Burhan was at the base when the drone struck on Wednesday morning. Official sources said he remained in the area and returned to the base to speak to troops, contradicting earlier reports that he had left for Port Sudan. An adviser to the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the army's rival in the war, denied that the paramilitary force was responsible for the strike.\n\nBurhan, whose foreign ministry had conditionally accepted a U.S. invitation to talks in August, told soldiers after the strike: \"We will not retreat, we will not give up, and we will not negotiate with any entity.\" \"We do not fear drones, we only die when God has planned,\" said Burhan, dressed in combat attire.\n\nFootage shared by the military that it says was filmed in Gibeit after the graduation ceremony showed Burhan being mobbed by cheering civilians, chanting \"one army, one people.\" The drone attack is the latest in a string of such attacks on army locations in recent months, and the closest to Port Sudan. Over the past two days, drone strikes have hit Kosti, Rabak, and Kenana in Sudan's southern White Nile state, as well as al-Damer, to the north of the capital, according to locals.\n\nThe RSF has not commented on those strikes. A video shared on social media and verified by Reuters showed soldiers marching in a graduation ceremony before a whirring sound is heard followed by the sound of an explosion. Another shows a cloud of dust and scores of people running.\n\n\"We heard sounds of explosions all of a sudden and everyone ran scared,\" said one eyewitness, noting that many families of graduating officers were present.\n\nWar broke out between the RSF and the regular army in April 2023 over plans to integrate the two forces under a political transition towards elections. The two forces had shared power uneasily after staging a coup in 2021, derailing a previous transition that followed the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019.\n\nThe conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, pushed half the population into a hunger crisis and driven more than 10 million out of their homes. On Wednesday an RSF official blamed the drone strike on Islamist elements. \"The RSF has nothing to do with the drones that targeted Gibeit today ... they are the result of internal disagreements, between Islamists,\" legal adviser Mohamed al-Mukhtar told Reuters.\n\nThe RSF had responded to Tuesday's foreign ministry statement saying it would only negotiate with the army, and not the Islamists who make up a large part of the civil service. Burhan on Wednesday said while he welcomed efforts to stop the war, mediators needed to consult Sudan on topics and participants as well as respect the government's sovereignty.\n\n\"We want to end the war with our heads held high and victorious, but if the enemy is in people's homes and is killing them, the war won't end,\" he said. In recent weeks, the RSF has renewed its efforts to capture more territory, and has staged incursions into the southeastern state of Sennar, displacing more than 165,000 people, as well as White Nile and al-Gedaref states.\n\nLast year, it swiftly took control of the capital Khartoum, followed by most of the Darfur region and El Gezira state, though it has continued to shell the city of al-Fashir, one of 14 sites in Sudan where experts warn of famine. Previous efforts to secure a lasting ceasefire have failed, and many Sudanese consider the talks in Switzerland as the best opportunity to negotiate an end to the war.\n\nThe talks are co-sponsored by Saudi Arabia and are to include Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which the army and others have said is supporting the RSF, in particular with weaponry such as drones.

Burhan, who was attending the ceremony, was unharmed and left for the city of Port Sudan, sources told Al-Jazeera.\n\nThe Sudanese Armed Forces said in a statement that its air defenses intercepted two drones that were launched at the base after the ceremony concluded. The attack killed five people and injured several others, it read.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been engaged in heavy fighting with the SAF for more than a year, have not claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe attack is the first attributed to the RSF in the Red Sea state since the power struggle between the SAF and RSF first erupted on April 15, 2023. There have been previous attacks led by local tribes against the army, fearing its presence in the area.\n\nIn light of the relative calm in the state, Port Sudan, which lies about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Gebit, has served as the army's de facto capital.\n\nArmy positions elsewhere across Sudan have come under repeated attacks blamed on the RSF.\n\nEarlier this month, several drones were fired at the headquarters of an army division in the White Nile city of Kosti in southern Sudan. Local media also reported drone strikes in the city of Rabak and at the air base in Kenana.\n\nIn June, the SAF said its air defenses shot down six drones launched by the RSF on three military areas in the states of Khartoum and White Nile.\n\nWednesday's attack in Gebit comes one day after Sudan's Foreign Ministry set out several conditions for participating in US-sponsored cease-fire talks.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday, the ministry said that while it is \"ready to engage in any negotiations that would end the RSF's occupation of cities and citizens' homes,\" any talks must be preceded by the RSF's full withdrawal and an end of its expansion in the country.\n\nLast week, the RSF announced that it would attend peace talks in Switzerland set for Aug. 14.\n\n\"We share with the international community the goal of achieving a full cease-fire across the country and facilitating humanitarian access to everyone in need,\" RSF leader Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo wrote on X.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last Tuesday that Washington has invited Sudan's warring parties for cease-fire talks in Switzerland.\n\nThe United States and Saudi Arabia brokered talks in Jeddah in May 2023 between the rival Sudanese parties. But the talks broke down one month later, as the army accused the RSF of failing to implement the terms of an agreement reached there. The last round of negotiations was held in December.\n\nThe renewed US push comes as the humanitarian situation in Sudan continues to deteriorate. The war has killed more than 40,000 people and more than 10 million others have been forced to flee their homes in what the United Nations describes as the world's worst displacement crisis.",

Officials from the government, which is aligned with the army, said he was taken safely to Port Sudan afterwards.\n\n\"We heard sounds of explosions all of a sudden and everyone ran scared,\" said one eyewitness, noting that many families of graduating officers were present.\n\nA video shared on social media and verified by Reuters showed soldiers marching in a graduation ceremony before a whirring sound is heard followed by the sound of an explosion. Another video shows a cloud of dust and scores of people running.\n\nFootage shared by the military that it says was filmed in Gibeit after the graduation ceremony shows Burhan being mobbed by cheering civilians, chanting \"one army, one people.\"\n\nThe drone attack is the latest in a string of such attacks on army locations in recent months, and the closest to Port Sudan. Over the past two days, drone strikes have hit Kosti, Rabak, and Kenana in Sudan's southern White Nile state, as well as al-Damer, to the north of the capital, according to locals.\n\nThe RSF has not commented on those strikes.\n\nWar broke out between the RSF and the regular army in April 2023 over plans to integrate the two forces under a political transition towards elections.\n\nThe two forces had shared power uneasily after staging a coup in 2021, derailing a previous transition that followed the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019.\n\nThe conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, pushed half the population into a hunger crisis and driven more than 10 million out of their homes.\n\nPLANS FOR PEACE TALKS\n\nThe latest strike came after the army-aligned foreign ministry conditionally accepted a U.S. invitation to talks in Switzerland in August. The RSF responded to the ministry's statement on Tuesday saying it would only negotiate with the army and not Islamists who dominate the civil service.\n\nOn Wednesday an RSF official blamed the drone strike on Islamist elements. \"The RSF has nothing to do with the drones that targeted Gibeit today...they are the result of internal disagreements, between Islamists,\" legal adviser Mohamed al-Mukhtar told Reuters.\n\nIn recent weeks, the RSF has renewed its efforts to capture more territory, and has staged incursions into the southeastern state of Sennar, displacing more than 165,000 people, as well as White Nile and al-Gedaref states.\n\nLast year, it swiftly took control of the capital Khartoum, followed by most of the Darfur region and El Gezira state, though it has continued to shell the city of al-Fashir, one of 14 sites in Sudan where experts warn of famine.\n\nPrevious efforts to mediate the conflict have failed to secure a lasting ceasefire, and many Sudanese consider the talks in Switzerland as the best opportunity to negotiate an end to the war.\n\nThe talks are co-sponsored by Saudi Arabia and are to include Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which the army and others have said is supporting the RSF, in particular with weaponry such as drones. The UAE denies the accusation.\n\n(Reporting by Khalid Abdelaziz in Dubai; Writing by Nafisa Eltahir and Nadine Awadalla; Editing by Michael Georgy and Ros Russell)", "source": {"uri": "swissinfo.ch",

Officials from the government, which is aligned with the army, said he was taken safely to Port Sudan afterwards.\n\n\"We heard sounds of explosions all of a sudden and everyone ran scared,\" said one eyewitness, noting that many families of graduating officers were present.\n\nA video shared on social media and verified by Reuters showed soldiers marching in a graduation ceremony before a whirring sound is heard followed by the sound of an explosion. Another video shows a cloud of dust and scores of people running.\n\nFootage shared by the military that it says was filmed in Gibeit after the graduation ceremony shows Burhan being mobbed by cheering civilians, chanting \"one army, one people.\"\n\nThe drone attack is the latest in a string of such attacks on army locations in recent months, and the closest to Port Sudan. Over the past two days, drone strikes have hit Kosti, Rabak, and Kenana in Sudan's southern White Nile state, as well as al-Damer, to the north of the capital, according to locals.\n\nThe RSF has not commented on those strikes.\n\nWar broke out between the RSF and the regular army in April 2023 over plans to integrate the two forces under a political transition towards elections.\n\nThe two forces had shared power uneasily after staging a coup in 2021, derailing a previous transition that followed the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019.\n\nThe conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, pushed half the population into a hunger crisis and driven more than 10 million out of their homes.\n\nThe latest strike came after the army-aligned foreign ministry conditionally accepted a U.S. invitation to talks in Switzerland in August. The RSF responded to the ministry's statement on Tuesday saying it would only negotiate with the army and not Islamists who dominate the civil service.\n\nOn Wednesday an RSF official blamed the drone strike on Islamist elements. \"The RSF has nothing to do with the drones that targeted Gibeit today ... they are the result of internal disagreements, between Islamists,\" legal adviser Mohamed al-Mukhtar told Reuters.\n\nIn recent weeks, the RSF has renewed its efforts to capture more territory, and has staged incursions into the southeastern state of Sennar, displacing more than 165,000 people, as well as White Nile and al-Gedaref states.\n\nLast year, it swiftly took control of the capital Khartoum, followed by most of the Darfur region and El Gezira state, though it has continued to shell the city of al-Fashir, one of 14 sites in Sudan where experts warn of famine.\n\nPrevious efforts to mediate the conflict have failed to secure a lasting ceasefire, and many Sudanese consider the talks in Switzerland as the best opportunity to negotiate an end to the war.\n\nThe talks are co-sponsored by Saudi Arabia and are to include Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which the army and others have said is supporting the RSF, in particular with weaponry such as drones.

Official sources said he remained in the area and returned to the base to speak to troops, contradicting earlier reports that he had left for Port Sudan.\n\nAn adviser to the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the army's rival in the war, denied that the paramilitary force was responsible for the strike.\n\nBurhan, whose foreign ministry had conditionally accepted a U.S. invitation to talks in August, told soldiers after the strike: \"We will not retreat, we will not give up, and we will not negotiate with any entity.\"\n\n\"We do not fear drones, we only die when God has planned,\" said Burhan, dressed in combat attire.\n\nFootage shared by the military that it says was filmed in Gibeit after the graduation ceremony showed Burhan being mobbed by cheering civilians, chanting \"one army, one people.\"\n\nThe drone attack is the latest in a string of such attacks on army locations in recent months, and the closest to Port Sudan. Over the past two days, drone strikes have hit Kosti, Rabak, and Kenana in Sudan's southern White Nile state, as well as al-Damer, to the north of the capital, according to locals.\n\nThe RSF has not commented on those strikes.\n\nA video shared on social media and verified by Reuters showed soldiers marching in a graduation ceremony before a whirring sound is heard followed by the sound of an explosion. Another shows a cloud of dust and scores of people running.\n\n\"We heard sounds of explosions all of a sudden and everyone ran scared,\" said one eyewitness, noting that many families of graduating officers were present.\n\nPLANS FOR PEACE TALKS\n\nWar broke out between the RSF and the regular army in April 2023 over plans to integrate the two forces under a political transition towards elections.\n\nThe two forces had shared power uneasily after staging a coup in 2021, derailing a previous transition that followed the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2019.\n\nThe conflict has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, pushed half the population into a hunger crisis and driven more than 10 million out of their homes.\n\nOn Wednesday an RSF official blamed the drone strike on Islamist elements. \"The RSF has nothing to do with the drones that targeted Gibeit today ... they are the result of internal disagreements, between Islamists,\" legal adviser Mohamed al-Mukhtar told Reuters.\n\nThe RSF had responded to Tuesday's foreign ministry statement saying it would only negotiate with the army, and not the Islamists who make up a large part of the civil service.\n\nBurhan on Wednesday said while he welcomed efforts to stop the war, mediators needed to consult Sudan on topics and participants, as well as respect the government's sovereignty.\n\n\"We want to end the war with our heads held high and victorious, but if the enemy is in people's homes and is killing them, the war won't end,\" he said.\n\nIn recent weeks, the RSF has renewed its efforts to capture more territory, and has staged incursions into the southeastern state of Sennar, displacing more than 165,000 people, as well as White Nile and al-Gedaref states.\n\nLast year, it swiftly took control of the capital Khartoum, followed by most of the Darfur region and El Gezira state, though it has continued to shell the city of al-Fashir, one of 14 sites in Sudan where experts warn of famine.\n\nPrevious efforts to secure a lasting ceasefire have failed, and many Sudanese consider the talks in Switzerland as the best opportunity to negotiate an end to the war.\n\nThe talks are co-sponsored by Saudi Arabia and are to include Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which the army and others have said is supporting the RSF, in particular with weaponry such as drones. The UAE denies the accusation.\n\n(Reporting by Khalid Abdelaziz in Dubai and Nafisa Eltahir in Cairo; writing by Nafisa Eltahir and Nadine Awadalla; Editing by Michael Georgy, Aidan Lewis and Ros Russell)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/08/e083f834-ddd9-56fb-88df-ca0ccc5ef5e7/66aa4cc289406.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C16&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776730", "eventUri": "eng-9776730", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3490196078431372, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Abdel-Fattah Burhan speaks in Khartoum, Sudan. AP\n\nThe military said in a statement Wednesday that the attack by two drones took place in Gebeit, a town in eastern Sudan after the ceremony was concluded. Military chief Burhan, who was attending, was not hurt, according to Lt. Col. Hassan Ibrahim, from the military spokesman's office.\n\nSudan has been torn by war for more than a year between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces. With fighting in the capital, Khartoum, the military leadership largely operates out of eastern Sudan near the Red Sea Coast.\n\nThe assassination attempt comes nearly a week after Sudan's paramilitary leader said that he plans to attend cease-fire talks in Switzerland next month arranged by the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\nSudan's foreign affairs ministry which is loyal to the regular army fighting paramilitaries said on Tuesday that it \"wants more discussions\" before accepting a US invitation for ceasefire talks.\n\n\"Any negotiation before... the complete withdrawal\" of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) headed by General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, and a \"halt\" to their expansion, are \"unacceptable\", the ministry said in a statement.\n\nAmerican Secretary of state Antony Blinken last week invited the Sudanese army and the RSF for negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, set to begin on August 14.\n\nThe same day, Daglo welcomed the invitation and announced the RSF's intent to participate. The army, headed by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, did not react.\n\nA war has raged in Sudan since April 2023 between the army and the RSF that has left tens of thousands dead and sparked a major humanitarian crisis.\n\nOn Sunday, the foreign affairs ministry asked for \"consultations with the Sudanese government on the form and agenda\" and for a \"meeting with the United States\" before any future negotiations.\n\nThe talks, co-sponsored by Saudi Arabia, must include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the UN as observers, Blinken said.\n\nThey are aimed at \"achieving a country-wide cessation of violence and allowing access for humanitarian aid\", said the top US diplomat.\n\nPrevious rounds of talks in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, ended in failure.\n\nThe war has forced the displacement of more than 11 million people both inside and outside Sudan's borders, according to the United Nations, obliterating infrastructure and pushing the country to the edge of famine.\n\nSome 25.6 million people -- more than half the population -- are facing high levels of \"acute food insecurity\", the world body said in a report published in late June.", "source": {"uri":

The attack killed five people and occurred amid renewed RSF territorial incursions.\n\nA drone strike hit an eastern Sudanese army base during a visit by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, eyewitnesses reported to Reuters on Wednesday. The incident has raised questions about the feasibility of ending the 15-month civil war.\n\nAccording to an army statement, the attack took place during a graduation ceremony at the Gibeit army base, roughly 100 km from Port Sudan in Sudan's Red Sea state, resulting in five fatalities. Social media videos showed soldiers marching before an explosion, with subsequent videos displaying chaos as people fled.\n\nGeneral Burhan was reported safe in Port Sudan.

said five people were killed in a drone attack on a ceremony at the Gibet base, where Burhan was overseeing a graduation ceremony.\n\n\"We will not retreat, we will not surrender, and we will not negotiate,\" Burhan, who appeared unharmed, told troops at the Gibet base after the attack.\n\n\"We are not scared of drones,\" he said at the Gibet base, about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from Port Sudan, where the army-aligned government fled after war broke out with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in April last year.\n\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe United States has invited both sides to negotiations next month in Geneva, which Sudan's foreign ministry on Tuesday said must be preceded by \"more discussions\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Burhan ruled out talks with the RSF.\n\nAny peace initiative \"must recognise, invite and consult the Sudanese state\", he said, referring to his government.\n\n\"We will not lay down our guns until we clean this country of every conspirator and every rebel,\" he vowed.\n\nAlready, the war -- which Burhan says the army intends to win \"with our head high\" -- has killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates of up to 150,000, according to US envoy to Sudan Tom Perriello.\n\nIt has also caused mass human rights violations and triggered the world's largest displacement crisis, according to the United Nations.\n\nOver 10 million people are currently displaced across Sudan, most in areas facing looming famine and worsening humanitarian conditions as fighting spreads.\n\nWednesday's attack was the first on a military base in Sudan's eastern Red Sea state, where the army, government and the United Nations have all relocated their headquarters.\n\nThe RSF controls most of the capital Khartoum, the central Al-Jazira state, nearly the entire vast western Darfur region, as well as large parts of Kordofan in the south.\n\nIt launched an offensive last month on Sennar state in the country's southeast, claiming the state capital and displacing more than 130,000 people, according to the UN.\n\nParamilitaries are also besieging El-Fasher -- the capital of North Darfur state and the largest city in the region not yet under the control of the RSF -- cutting off food and water to hundreds of thousands of civilians.\n\nSixty-five people, mostly

military graduation ceremony.\n\nVideo footage from the ceremony, seen by Middle East Eye, showed Burhan flanked by army officers, high-fiving military students who were ululating and shouting \"God is great\".\n\nTwo drone strikes targeted the event at the conclusion of the ceremony, according to a statement from the Sudanese military.\n\nBurhan was unharmed and government anti-aircraft missiles were deployed to counter the drones, the statement added.\n\nThe eastern town of Gibet is located approximately 100km from the army's de facto capital, Port Sudan, in Red Sea state.\n\nAmong the five people killed were students and an army officer, according to a report in the Sudan Tribune.\n\nEyewitnesses reported at least five drones were involved in the attack, which also damaged a university building.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary, which has been at war with Sudan's army since 15 April of last year, did not immediately take responsibility or comment on the incident.\n\nWhile the RSF is the most obvious suspect, army sources told Middle East Eye they are not currently sure who is responsible for the attack.\n\nThe assassination attempt is the latest among several attacks on army locations in recent weeks, including in Atbara, Gedaref, Shendi, Kosti and Kenana.\n\nTuesday's strike was the closest to the army's de facto capital in Port Sudan.\n\nThe war has displaced over eight million people and has left 18 million \"acutely food insecure\", according to the UN World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThe attack comes just one day after

Abdel-Fattah Burhan, survived a drone attack on a military graduation ceremony that killed five people in the country's east.\n\nThe military said in a statement Wednesday that the attack by two drones took place in Gebeit, a town in eastern Sudan, after the ceremony was concluded. Military chief Burhan, who was attending, was not hurt, according to Lt. Col. Hassan Ibrahim, from the military spokesman's office.\n\nSudan has been torn by war for more than a year between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces.

Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has been leading a war for control of the country against his rival, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, the head of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.\n\nSudan's army said two drone strikes hit an army base in the country's east on Wednesday after a graduation ceremony attended by the country's de facto leader, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who has been locked in a civil war for over a year with a rival military general.\n\nAt least five people were killed and several others injured in the attack in the town of Gebeit, the army said, which has been held by the army and is about 50 miles from its wartime capital of Port Sudan. The Sudanese army spokesman, Nabil Abdallah, told the BBC that General al-Burhan had survived an assassination attempt, and blamed it on the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group that has been battling the army for power for 15 months.\n\nA military spokesman could not be reached for comment. In statements posted on social media, the military did not say whether General al-Burhan had been hurt or where he was during the attack. But it posted videos showing him interacting with the soldiers and members of the public before and after the graduation ceremony.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the strikes. The paramilitary group's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe war between General al-Burhan and his rival, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, who leads the Rapid Support Forces, has devastated Sudan, one of Africa's largest nations. More than 18,000 people have been killed, according to an estimate from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, though aid workers estimate the death toll to be higher.\n\nAt least 10 million people have been driven from their homes, according to the United Nations, while more than half the country's 48 million people face hunger, and hundreds of thousands of others are facing a looming famine.\n\nThe army and the paramilitary group have both used drones in the war, which are sometimes supplied by close foreign allies such as Iran or the United Arab Emirates, according to Western and Sudanese officials.\n\nThe paramilitary group, which has dominated the capital, Khartoum, and the western region of Darfur, has in recent weeks been ramping up its attacks on areas controlled by the army in the east. The paramilitary group has also recently clashed with the army in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, and in the southeastern state of Sennar.\n\nThe two military leaders were once allies who brutally cracked down on Sudan's pro-democracy forces after a popular revolt forced out the country's longtime dictator, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. But they fell out over who should hold supreme power in the country and how swiftly their forces should merge into a single army.\n\nThe reported drone attacks on the base come just two weeks before mediation talks to end the war, hosted by the United States, were set to begin in Switzerland. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said in a statement this month that Saudi Arabia will co-host the talks, which will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations as observers.\n\nThe paramilitary force's leader, General Hamdan, said his group will participate in the talks. On Tuesday, Sudan's foreign ministry, which is allied with the army, signaled it was ready to join the talks in Geneva on Aug. 14. but said the paramilitary should stop its attacks and open humanitarian corridors.\n\nThe army, however, has also been accused of thwarting the flow of food aid, especially to the Darfur region in the west, by preventing United Nations trucks from passing through a crucial border checkpoint. The army says it is necessary to stop the flow of weapons.\n\nThe war in Sudan has become one of the world's most urgent, and ignored, humanitarian emergencies. The country's health care system has been all but decimated, disrupting treatment for millions. Disease outbreaks have risen, with aid groups saying hundreds have died from malaria, dengue, measles and other illnesses.\n\nSchools and universities have been shuttered in a nation that once drew many foreign students. Looting has been widespread, with banks, private homes and government institutions burned and robbed.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abdi_latif_dahir@nytimes.com", "name": "Abdi Latif Dahir", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/07/31/multimedia/31sudan-whmz/31sudan-whmz-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776730", "eventUri": "eng-9776730", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-14", "textStart": 3437, "textEnd": 3444}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, who has been locked in a civil war for over a year with a rival military general.\n\nAt least five people were killed and several others injured in the attack in the town of Gebeit, the army said, which has been held by the army and is about 50 miles from its wartime capital of Port Sudan. The Sudanese army spokesman, Nabil Abdallah, told the BBC that General al-Burhan had survived an assassination attempt, and blamed it on the Rapid Support Forces, the paramilitary group that has been battling the army for power for 15 months.\n\nA military spokesman could not be reached for comment. In statements posted on social media, the military did not say whether General al-Burhan had been hurt or where he was during the attack. But it posted videos showing him interacting with the soldiers and members of the public before and after the graduation ceremony.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the strikes. The paramilitary group's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe war between General al-Burhan and his rival, Lt. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan, who leads the Rapid Support Forces, has devastated Sudan, one of Africa's largest nations. More than 18,000 people have been killed, according to an estimate from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, though aid workers estimate the death toll to be higher.\n\nAt least 10 million people have been driven from their homes, according to the United Nations, while more than half the country's 48 million people face hunger, and hundreds of thousands of others are facing a looming famine.\n\nThe army and the paramilitary group have both used drones in the war, which are sometimes supplied by close foreign allies such as Iran or the United Arab Emirates, according to Western and Sudanese officials.\n\nThe paramilitary group, which has dominated the capital, Khartoum, and the western region of Darfur, has in recent weeks been ramping up its attacks on areas controlled by the army in the east. The paramilitary group has also recently clashed with the army in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, and in the southeastern state of Sennar.\n\nThe two military leaders were once allies who brutally cracked down on Sudan's pro-democracy forces after a popular revolt forced out the country's longtime dictator, Omar Hassan al-Bashir. But they fell out over who should hold supreme power in the country and how swiftly their forces should merge into a single army.\n\nThe reported drone attacks on the base come just two weeks before mediation talks to end the war, hosted by the United States, were set to begin in Switzerland. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said in a statement this month that Saudi Arabia will co-host the talks, which will include the African Union, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Nations as observers.\n\nThe paramilitary force's leader, General Hamdan, said his group will participate in the talks. On Tuesday, Sudan's foreign ministry, which is allied with the army, signaled it was ready to join the talks in Geneva on Aug. 14. but said the paramilitary should stop its attacks and open humanitarian corridors.\n\nThe army, however, has also been accused of thwarting the flow of food aid, especially to the Darfur region in the west, by preventing United Nations trucks from passing through a crucial border checkpoint. The army says it is necessary to stop the flow of weapons.\n\nThe war in Sudan has become one of the world's most urgent, and ignored, humanitarian emergencies. The country's health care system has been all but decimated, disrupting treatment for millions. Disease outbreaks have risen, with aid groups saying hundreds have died from malaria, dengue, measles and other illnesses.\n\nSchools and universities have been shuttered in a nation that once drew many foreign students.

The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group, is suspected of orchestrating the assault. This incident follows the recent agreement by General Burhan's government to attend upcoming peace negotiations mediated by the United States.\n\nThe RSF's involvement in this attack comes during a prolonged conflict that has persisted for over 16 months, battling for dominance in Sudan. Efforts to reach a peaceful resolution to the ongoing crisis have repeatedly failed, with both factions unwilling to fulfill their obligations from previous agreements. The ongoing strife has resulted in a significant humanitarian crisis, displacing over ten million citizens.\n\nThe RSF has yet to issue a statement regarding the drone strikes. Video footage circulating among attendees depicted military graduates performing their ceremonial duties just before the attack occurred.\n\nGeneral Abdallah emphasized the RSF's role as the principal aggressor against the Sudanese populace, stating, \"The only party that is hostile to the Sudanese people and targeting the Sudanese people is the rebel Rapid Support Forces.\" He expressed relief that General Burhan and other military commanders remained unharmed, noting that major injuries were not sustained during the event.\n\nThe Jabait military base is approximately 100 kilometers away from Port Sudan, serving as the military's hub.

With the fighting taking place in the capital, Khartoum , military leaders are operating mainly in the east of the country, near the Red Sea coast .\n\nVideos posted by Al Araby TV show several people running on a dusty road at the time of the drone attack, while other footage shows graduation ceremony attendees apparently looking skyward as the drone struck.\n\nThe assassination attempt comes nearly a week after the head of Sudan's paramilitary forces said he planned to attend ceasefire talks in Switzerland next month, hosted by the United States and Saudi Arabia .\n\nGeneral Mohammed Hamdan Daglo , head of the Rapid Support Forces fighting the Sudanese army, had stressed at the time that these talks would constitute \"a major step\" towards peace and stability in Sudan and would allow the creation of a new state based on \"justice, equality and federalism\" .\n\nThe Sudanese Foreign Ministry responded on Tuesday to the US invitation to participate in the Geneva talks, saying that the military-controlled Sudanese government was ready to take part, but that any negotiations before the implementation of the Jeddah Declaration \"would not be acceptable to the Sudanese people . \"\n\nThe Jeddah Declaration on Commitment to Protecting Civilians, adopted last year, aimed to end the conflict, but neither side has committed to its goals.\n\nRepresentatives of the Sudanese army and the RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, have engaged in talks restarted by the United States and Saudi Arabia in Jeddah, focusing on delivering humanitarian aid , securing ceasefires and paving the way for a permanent cessation of aggression, among other goals.\n\nIn its statement on Tuesday, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry accused the RSF of being the only party attacking cities, villages and civilians. The military-controlled Sudanese government called for sanctions to be imposed on the \"rebels to stop their ongoing aggression, end the siege of cities and open the roads . \"\n\n\"The participants in this initiative are the same as those who took part in the Jeddah talks, and the topics discussed are identical to those that were agreed upon ,\" the statement read.\n\nThe ministry added that the military-led government should be consulted on the agenda for any negotiations and the parties that would participate, with the provisions of the Jeddah Declaration to serve as the basis for future talks.\n\n\"The Sudanese government has requested that a meeting be held with the United States government in order to pave the way for peace negotiations in the interest of the Sudanese people ,\" the foreign ministry said.\n\nCameron Hudson, former chief of staff to the special envoy to Sudan, said the response from the Sudanese military government was \"much more positive and open\" than he had expected, as it opened the door to preliminary talks with the United States.\n\n\"I do not know of any other US envoy who has had to negotiate such a complex set of issues without access to the country, its people and its leadership. An impossible task. The US should seize this opportunity and propose parallel talks with the Rapid Support Forces (SAF) as soon as possible ,\" he said.\n\nThe Rapid Support Forces were formed from Janjaweed fighters created under former Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir , who ruled the country for three decades before being overthrown in a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court for genocide and other crimes committed during the Darfur conflict in the 2000s.\n\nMore than 4.6 million people have been displaced by the conflict, according to the UN migration agency. Of these, more than 3.6 million have fled to safer areas within Sudan and more than a million have crossed into neighbouring countries. More than 285,300 people have fled to Egypt .", "source": {"uri": "africanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Africanews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

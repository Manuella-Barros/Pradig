{"id": 223683036, "title": "I missed \u00a3140m penalty in Championship play-off final \u2013 then got relegated to Non-League", "text": "A year ago, Fankaty Dabo was on the cusp of the Premier League \u2013 but now he's a free agent after being kicked to the curb by his Non-League club. The former Chelsea youngster, 28, missed a vital penalty in the 2023 Championship play-off final shootout between Coventry and Luton, and was released by the Sky Blues a few days later. He had to drop down a couple of divisions to pick up another contract, with League Two outfit Forest Green Rovers offering him a lifeline last September. But his campaign there was a disaster, with the Gloucestershire side ending up rock bottom of the table and relegated to the National League. As such, Rovers were forced to release several key players, including Dabo, last month. During the season, the right-back was publicly criticised by manager Troy Deeney during the former Watford striker's cataclysmic 29-day tenure at the helm. Speaking to reporters after a defeat to Harrogate Town in January, Deeney took aim at Dabo, warning him that unless his form improved he'd be spending the remainder of the season on the sidelines. \"I said to him in front of everyone, six months ago, you had a kick to get to the Premier League. Now you won\u2019t even get a game in the National League,\" Deeney revealed. Harsh criticism notwithstanding, neither Deeney's predecessor, David Horseman, nor his successor, Steve Cotterill, seemed to share his views on Dabo, with the London-born star featuring 35 times for the club in all competitions over the course of the campaign. Dabo's career began at Chelsea. He joined their academy in 2007 aged 12 and spent 12 years on the club's books. He never managed to break into the first team squad however, and spent a large chunk of his final years at Stamford Bridge out on loan. In 2016/17 he joined Swindon for a season, before spending the next two seasons in Holland, initially with Vitesse Arnhem and later with Sparta Rotterdam. He then joined Coventry on a permanent basis in 2019, and helped the club seal promotion to the Championship in his first campaign there. Dabo eventually racked up over 131 appearances for the Midlands club before being released in 2023. He's now on the hunt for a new club, but judging by last year's lengthy search for one, that might be easier said than done. Those playing for Leeds and Southampton in this year's final at Wembley will certainly be hoping to avoid a similar fate to Dabo, especially given the winning team can expect to gain a revenue increase of at least \u00a3140million over the next three seasons.

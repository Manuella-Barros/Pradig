{"id": 231979678, "title": "Jake Sullivan says US supported Israel in hostage rescue - POLITICO", "text": "Four Israeli hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 were rescued on Saturday in an IDF special operation that the Gaza Health Ministry said killed 274 Palestinians. Sullivan also said there was no confirmation any Israeli hostages were killed in the rescue mission, something Bash said Hamas has claimed. But Sullivan added there is always a risk: \u201cI believe that the Israelis have said they do not have any information to that effect,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cWith all of these military operations, hostages have been killed over the last eight months.\u201d In regards to a recently proposed cease-fire deal, Sullivan said he is waiting to hear from Hamas. He said the plan would put in place a cease-fire and immediately begin the process of bringing hostages home. \u201cTo bring an end to this war, to get the hostages home, to get the full scope of humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people in a safe and effective way, we need this deal,\u201d Sullivan said. And when asked if President Joe Biden is pleased with how Israel handled the operation, Sullivan said the president \u201cthinks the best way to get all of the hostages home is in a deal where they\u2019re brought out diplomatically.\u201d \u201cThat would obviously be the best solution to this,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIn the absence of that, without Hamas saying yes to the deal, unfortunately, we are going to continue to see ongoing conflict and military operations in which Israel makes efforts to recover its citizens and, frankly, to recover American citizens.\u201d", "summary": "Sullivan also said there was no confirmation any Israeli hostages were killed in the rescue mission.", "url": "https://www.politico.com/news/2024/06/09/jake-sullivan-support-israel-hostage-rescue-gaza-00162408", "image": "https://static.politico.com/36/5f/0c42513e434b9ffa56dcfcbefcf8/biden-02842.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:36:34", "author": "Mia McCarthy", "authors": ["Mia McCarthy"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "eu", "sentiment": -0.02}

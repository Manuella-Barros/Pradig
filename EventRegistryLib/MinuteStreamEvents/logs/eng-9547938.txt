The law, prompted by the frustration a legislator felt at not being able to buy tickets to Swift's 2023 concert in Minneapolis, will require ticket sellers to disclose all fees up front and prohibit resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket for live events held in Minnesota, among other measures.\n\nBy Trisha Ahmed, Associated Press/Report for America\n\nTuesday, May 7, 2024 | 10:23 p.m.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS -- People buying tickets online for concerts, sporting events and other live events in Minnesota will be guaranteed more transparency and protection under a so-called Taylor Swift bill signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nThe law, prompted by the frustration a legislator felt at not being able to buy tickets to Swift's 2023 concert in Minneapolis, will require ticket sellers to disclose all fees up front and prohibit resellers from selling more than one copy of a ticket, among other measures. The law will apply to tickets purchased in Minnesota or other states for concerts or other live events held in Minnesota.\n\nWalz signed House File 1989 -- a reference to Swift's birth year and an album with that title -- at First Avenue, a popular concert venue in downtown Minneapolis.\n\n\"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that we would be at a bill signing for House File 1989 at First Avenue,\" Democratic Rep. Kelly Moller, chief author of the bill, said.\n\nMoller was among thousands of people who became stuck in ticket sales company Ticketmaster's system after it crashed in 2022 amid the huge demand for Swift concert tickets and attacks from bots, which tried to buy tickets for resale at inflated prices. The situation led to congressional hearings but no federal legislation.\n\nSupporters of Minnesota's new law say the state joins Maryland as among the few states to pass protections for ticket buyers into law.\n\nTicketmaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new Minnesota law. Taylor Swift's media team also did not respond.\n\nJessica Roey, a spokesperson for StubHub, said in an email, \"StubHub has long advocated for legislation that protects fans from anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices in the ticket buying process. We share the goals of HF1989 and look forward to continuing discussions with policymakers to advance policies that provide more transparency, more control, and more choice for ticket buyers.\"\n\nWalz, a Democrat, said the new law is \"protection so you don't get a bad ticket, a fraudulent ticket, and resellers can't snatch them all up before you get an opportunity.\"\n\nTwo young girls -- one wearing a shirt that said \"A LOT going on at the moment\" in a nod to Swift, and another wearing a shirt that said \"Iowa 22\" in reference to basketball star Caitlin Clark -- attended the bill signing with their dad, Mike Dean, who testified in support of the bill this year.\n\nDean said his daughter \"came to me in December and said, 'Dad, I want to go to see Caitlin Clark.' As a father, I just couldn't resist. And so I went online to go buy tickets.\"\n\nThe tickets were supposed to cost $300 total, Dean said, but they ended up costing over $500 because of hidden fees. The timer had begun in the online checkout process, so he had just minutes to decide whether to buy the tickets or lose them.\n\nHe ultimately bought the tickets. But Dean said these practices mean customers can't make informed decisions. The new law, he said, will bring transparency to the process.\n\nThe law takes effect Jan. 1, 2025, and applies to tickets sold on or after that date.\n\nAdrianna Korich, director of ticketing at First Avenue, said she supports the new rules, saying fans are sometimes tricked into paying up to 10 times a ticket's face value because of deceptive websites and resellers who list tickets without actually possessing them. The new law bans both, she said.\n\n\"We have all heard the horror stories from the Taylor Swift Eras tour and have seen the astronomical prices that are being charged at checkout,\" Korich said.", "source": {"uri": "lasvegassun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "trisha_ahmed@lasvegassun.com", "name": "Trisha Ahmed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Avenue_(nightclub)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Avenue (nightclub)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticketmaster", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ticketmaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Moller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Moller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central,_Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central, Minneapolis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "StubHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swift County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Swift County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caitlin_Clark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caitlin Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Dean_(record_producer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Dean (record producer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-competitive_practices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-competitive practices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "False advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horror film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://media.lasvegassun.com/media/img/photos/2024/05/07/AP24128842820777_t1200.jpg?a58a258a4dac404905303588401680fdf3ee23e4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547938", "eventUri": "eng-9547938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 249, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Trisha Ahmed)\n\nTicketmaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new Minnesota law. Taylor Swift\u00b4s media team also did not respond.\n\nJessica Roey, a spokesperson for StubHub, said in an email, \"StubHub has long advocated for legislation that protects fans from anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices in the ticket buying process. We share the goals of HF1989 and look forward to continuing discussions with policymakers to advance policies that provide more transparency, more control, and more choice for ticket buyers.\"\n\nWalz, a Democrat, said the new law is \"protection so you don't get a bad ticket, a fraudulent ticket, and resellers can't snatch them all up before you get an opportunity.\"\n\nTwo young girls - one wearing a shirt that said \"A LOT going on at the moment\" in a nod to Swift, and another wearing a shirt that said \"Iowa 22\" in reference to basketball star Caitlin Clark - attended the bill signing with their dad, Mike Dean, who testified in support of the bill this year.\n\nDean said his daughter \"came to me in December and said, 'Dad, I want to go to see Caitlin Clark.\u00b4 As a father, I just couldn\u00b4t resist. And so I went online to go buy tickets.\"\n\nThe tickets were supposed to cost $300 total, Dean said, but they ended up costing over $500 because of hidden fees. The timer had begun in the online checkout process, so he had just minutes to decide whether to buy the tickets or lose them.\n\nHe ultimately bought the tickets. But Dean said these practices mean customers can't make informed decisions. The new law, he said, will bring transparency to the process.\n\nThe law takes effect Jan. 1, 2025, and applies to tickets sold on or after that date.\n\nAdrianna Korich, director of ticketing at First Avenue, said she supports the new rules, saying fans are sometimes tricked into paying up to 10 times a ticket's face value because of deceptive websites and resellers who list tickets without actually possessing them. The new law bans both, she said.\n\n\"We have all heard the horror stories from the Taylor Swift Eras tour and have seen the astronomical prices that are being charged at checkout,\" Korich said.\n\nTrisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Kelly Moller, chief author of the bill, said.\n\nMoller was among thousands of people who became stuck in ticket sales company Ticketmaster's system after it crashed in 2022 amid the huge demand for Swift concert tickets and attacks from bots, which tried to buy tickets for resale at inflated prices. The situation led to congressional hearings but no federal legislation.\n\nSupporters of Minnesota's new law say the state joins Maryland as among the few states to pass protections for ticket buyers into law.\n\nTicketmaster did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new Minnesota law. Taylor Swift's media team also did not respond.\n\nJessica Roey, a spokesperson for StubHub, said in an email, \"StubHub has long advocated for legislation that protects fans from anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices in the ticket buying process. We share the goals of HF1989 and look forward to continuing discussions with policymakers to advance policies that provide more transparency, more control, and more choice for ticket buyers.\"\n\nWalz, a Democrat, said the new law is \"protection so you don't get a bad ticket, a fraudulent ticket, and resellers can't snatch them all up before you get an opportunity.\"\n\nTwo young girls -- one wearing a shirt that said \"A LOT going on at the moment\" in a nod to Swift, and another wearing a shirt that said \"Iowa 22\" in reference to basketball star Caitlin Clark -- attended the bill signing with their dad, Mike Dean, who testified in support of the bill this year.\n\nDean said his daughter \"came to me in December and said, 'Dad, I want to go to see Caitlin Clark.' As a father, I just couldn't resist. And so I went online to go buy tickets.\"\n\nThe tickets were supposed to cost $300 total, Dean said, but they ended up costing over $500 because of hidden fees. The timer had begun in the online checkout process, so he had just minutes to decide whether to buy the tickets or lose them.\n\nHe ultimately bought the tickets. But Dean said these practices mean customers can't make informed decisions. The new law, he said, will bring transparency to the process.\n\nThe law takes effect Jan. 1, 2025, and applies to tickets sold on or after that date.\n\nAdrianna Korich, director of ticketing at First Avenue, said she supports the new rules, saying fans are sometimes tricked into paying up to 10 times a ticket's face value because of deceptive websites and resellers who list tickets without actually possessing them. The new law bans both, she said.\n\n\"We have all heard the horror stories from the Taylor Swift Eras tour and have seen the astronomical prices that are being charged at checkout,\" Korich said.\n\nTrisha Ahmed is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Walz signs 'Taylor Swift bill' into law, requiring more regulation in the ticketing industry", "body": "ST. PAUL -- Gov. Tim Walz signed a bill on Tuesday that would increase transparency when purchasing tickets to concerts, games and other events.\n\nThe law requires ticket sellers to list the full price, including fees, up front on their website. It also bans speculative ticketing, where tickets are sold before they are actually available. And it would prevent ticket companies and resellers from using deceptive practices.\n\n\"This is about fairness in how we go about ticketing,\" Walz said at a signing ceremony at First Avenue. \"It's protection, so you don't get a fraudulent ticket. The resellers can't snatch them all up before you get an opportunity to do it.\"\n\nThe law will go into effect in January.\n\nRep. Kelly Moller, DFL-Shoreview, authored the bill in the House, and Sen. Matt Klein, DFL-Mendota Heights, sponsored the bill in the Senate. The bill was introduced last session, and the pair spent the interim between legislative sessions talking to stakeholders who would be affected by the bill.\n\n\"Everybody has that story that you wanted to take your kids to the Twins game, and you thought maybe you were getting a ticket for $65,\" said Klein. \"And then all of a sudden, at the end of the process, it was $89 and you're on a five-minute clock that's ticking down.\"\n\nMoller said the inspiration for the bill came from her experience trying to secure tickets to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour in Minneapolis last summer. She wasn't alone in her frustrations. When thousands of fans couldn't get tickets for Swift's tour, some paid upwards of 70 times face value to secure tickets. It prompted lawmakers across the country to introduce bills similar to Moller's, which is fittingly identified as HF1989, a number many fans know as both the year Swift was born and the name of her fifth studio album.\n\nBill sponsors also worked closely with local and independent venues across the state, such as First Avenue and Hennepin Theatre Trust. Adrianna Korich, director of ticketing at First Avenue Productions, said deceptive ticketing practices have a negative impact on small and local businesses.\n\n\"Fans are tired of being price gouged on the secondary market and they have lost faith in the ticketing landscape,\" she said. \"This is a major win for our state, our local music scene and local economy.\n\nKorich noted that when the law goes into effect in January, consumers may see an increase in ticket prices at first, but that's because ticket sellers will be required to include all the ticket fees up front.\n\nDespite what seems like a straightforward consumer rights issue, sharp disagreements among venues and ticket sellers, as well as lobbying campaigns by industry and consumer groups, have made bills in other states unsuccessful.\n\nRobert Singleton, director of policy and public affairs for the Chamber of Progress, spoke against HF1989 at a committee hearing earlier this year. Singleton argued that the bill would hurt consumers by restricting the role of ticket resellers and speculative ticketing.\n\n\"Limiting access to these secondary markets could stifle innovation in a ticketing marketplace that creates better options for consumers,\" he said.\n\nStubHub and Vivid Seats, two of the largest ticket reselling companies, are members of the Chamber of Progress.", "source": {"uri": "inforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "INFORUM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Avenue_(nightclub)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Avenue (nightclub)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Klein", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Klein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Moller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kelly Moller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Twins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Twins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamber_of_Progress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chamber of Progress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_resale", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ticket resale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StubHub", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "StubHub"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hennepin_County,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hennepin County, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hennepin County, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivid_Seats", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vivid Seats"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/d0dffc9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1520+0+0/resize/1403x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff7%2Fb6%2F491cb0834248a56dff9258d0086e%2Fb81370-20240507-people-clap-on-stage-2000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547938", "eventUri": "eng-9547938", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Taylor Swift's media team also did not respond.\n\nJessica Roey, a spokesperson for StubHub, said in an email, \"StubHub has long advocated for legislation that protects fans from anti-competitive and anti-consumer practices in the ticket buying process.

Photo Credit: Tom Conway\n\nAnother \"Taylor Swift\" bill has surfaced, this time in Minnesota, where ticket resellers and the involved platforms will be subject to a number of new requirements beginning next year.\n\nThe North Star State yesterday adopted House File 1989 (the latter is Swift's birth year and the title of her fifth studio album), with Governor Tim Walz having signed the measure into law at downtown Minneapolis venue First Avenue, per local reports.\n\nThis law is just the latest in a line of legislation enacted at the state level following the Eras Tour pre-sale fiasco, which, owing to ample fan demand for the record-breaking concert series, left many without tickets. Notably, though, House File 1989 covers more ground than and differs from related legislation in different states.\n\nAt the top level, the Minnesota law (which won't go into effect until 2025, once again) extends to tickets for \"all forms of entertainment,\" including but not limited to theater and opera performances, concerts, amusement parks, sports events, \"and all other forms of diversion, recreation, or show.\"\n\nSimilarly all-encompassing is the bill's classification of \"ticket reseller,\" referring to any person who \"offers or sells tickets\" to in-state events following the original sale. That includes transactions completed over the internet, via \"telephone, mail, delivery service, [or] facsimile,\" or through other means, but expressly excludes sales attributable to individuals who purchased passes \"solely\" for their own use or the use of their \"invitees, employees, or agents.\"\n\nRunning with those significant definitions, ticket resellers and online ticket marketplaces are required to disclose at the point of sale tickets' all-in cost, a conspicuous breakdown of fees, a notice that the passes are being resold, a refund policy, and more. However, the requirements only apply to individual resellers who move north of $5,000 in tickets annually.\n\nFurthermore, ticket resellers and marketplaces are barred under the law from advertising \"more than one copy of the same ticket,\" listing tickets before they've first gone on sale, offering tickets without providing specific seating information, and enlisting individuals \"to wait in line to purchase tickets\" (with plans to resell) if the practice is prohibited generally or by the venue, among different things.\n\nNext, ticket-resale marketplaces, \"unless acting on behalf of the\" venue, event, or act(s) at hand, cannot incorporate into the relevant URLs the venue name, the event name, or the name of the entertainment professional, according to the law.\n\nLastly, individuals are blocked from circumventing \"any portion\" of the ticket-purchase process, including \"security or identity validation measures or an access control system,\" besides disguising their identities to buy more than the maximum-allowed number of tickets.\n\nEven an individual who knows that a ticket was obtained in violation of these validation measures cannot resell the pass under the law. Ticket marketplaces, for their part, must turn over \"information about technology and methods used\" in alleged violation of the law to the commerce commissioner on request.\n\nShare on:\n\nFacebook Twitter LinkedIn Copy Link", "source": {"uri": "digitalmusicnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Music News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dylan_smith@digitalmusicnews.com", "name": "Dylan Smith", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_resale", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ticket resale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Conway", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Conway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Avenue_(nightclub)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Avenue (nightclub)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Downtown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_sale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Point of sale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "URL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Minnesota-FT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547938", "eventUri": "eng-9547938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 103}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

This includes directly interviewing sources and analyzing primary source documents.\n\nLauren Smiley cut back on big-name concerts after bots gobbled up her presale tickets to both Brandi Carlile and Caamp. Jonathan Kahn stopped building out his Red Rocks season ahead of time because AXS, the primary ticket seller for Red Rocks, changed their resale platform, making it harder for him to recoup costs if he couldn't attend a concert. Johnny Joy, a former concert promoter, has all but ditched Denver concerts for his own home venue, outfitted with four screens and two surround sound systems.\n\nWhether it's getting elbowed out by bots, surfing scammy websites or getting slapped with last-second service fees, people are fed up with the way tickets are sold, and it's changing the way they attend events.\n\nA bipartisan bill could address some, but not all, of those concerns.\n\nHouse Bill 1378 passed the legislature on Monday, leaving it up to Gov. Jared Polis to sign or veto.\n\nWe've been here before. Last year, Polis vetoed Senate Bill 60, a proposal to rein in deceptive ticketing practices by imposing fines up to $2 million on fraudulent ticket sellers and operators that use bots. The measure also would have prevented ticket sites from sneaking service and convenience fees into a concertgoer's cart.\n\nSecondary ticket sellers like StubHub and consumer protection groups like the Sports Fan Coalition were among those who lined up in opposition to Senate Bill 60. They took issue with a provision that would have allowed operators to revoke season tickets for reasons \"relating to a violation of venue policies,\" according to the bill's text.\n\nThe groups worried that granting operators that right would indirectly open a loophole that Ticketmaster could slide through to shut down their competitors by insisting that venues refuse tickets bought on the secondary market. They argued that consumers would get caught in this competitive crossfire, with one testimonial on the Senate floor calling the bill \"a Trojan horse\" for Ticketmaster's interests.\n\nIn vetoing the 2023 legislation, Polis said he agreed with the loophole concerns and asserted that it didn't go far enough to protect consumers.\n\nHouse Bill 1378 bill includes many of the same provisions as last year's measure, including mandatory upfront disclosure of fees, but it's slimmer than its predecessor, with legislators dialing back their definition of deceptive practices, simplifying the language around ticket fees and omitting any mentions of penalties for those who don't comply.\n\nThe first change that consumers may see is more transparent ticket prices.\n\nService fees and so-called convenience fees would have to be shown with the original ticket price, though delivery fees for paper tickets and sales tax could still be tacked on later.\n\n\"All-in pricing is what fans want the most. They want to be shown one number and they don't want that number to change,\" said Brian Hess, executive director of the Sports Fans Coalition, which worked with lawmakers on drafting the new bill.\n\nAll-in pricing, or showing the consumer the total ticket price upfront, has been tested before. In 2013, StubHub, the nation's largest ticket reseller, decided to include its 15%-17% service fees in the initial ticket price.\n\nThe experiment lasted two years, during which StubHub's market value declined sharply.\n\nBefore the company completely reverted back to \"drip pricing\" -- in which fees are added later in the purchasing process -- they split consumers into two groups. Half were shown a website with all-in pricing, and the other half checked out with drip pricing.\n\nThe results confirmed what StubHub, ticket sellers and marketing professionals had hypothesized all along: Consumers are more likely to purchase tickets from a site that shows a lower upfront cost, regardless of how much fees jack that price up.\n\nA second, more subtle conclusion was drawn from an additional study that looked at StubHub's data: Not only were people more willing to spend money on tickets with hidden fees, but they were more likely to buy higher quality tickets -- those closer to the stage or the field -- since the original prices appeared lower.\n\n\"That is evidence that the market is broken, right? The company doing the right thing by its customers lost money,\" Hess said. \"The only way (forward) is if all market participants are required to do all-in pricing. That would level the playing field and allow consumers to adequately price shop for tickets.\"\n\nStubHub and the Sports Fans Coalition were vocal opponents of last year's bill, with Hess contributing to an op-ed in the Denver Post and representatives from both groups testifying against it in the Senate. But the groups did not oppose this year's bill, despite the lack of any new rules against bots or ticket holdbacks -- two of the biggest concerns raised last year.\n\n\"This is a compromise bill,\" Hess said. \"All parties would like more.\"\n\nThe bill would also guarantee event entry to anyone with a valid ticket, regardless of whether they bought the ticket on the primary or secondary market. This is a potential win for ticket resellers like StubHub, and a reversal of the most contentious part of last year's bill, proposing that venue operators be permitted to revoke tickets.\n\nThe bill wouldn't affect the widespread use of bots, which have been technically illegal to use since the federal government enacted the BOTS Act in 2016, though the law has only been enforced once in its eight year history. The question of who is responsible for regulating bots is mostly unanswered.\n\nIn January, during a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on competition in the ticketing industry, executives of Live Nation -- the parent company of Ticketmaster -- claimed that bots were responsible for the widely publicized ticketing meltdown ahead of Taylor Swift's \"Eras\" tour. (The U.S. Department of Justice has since announced its intent to sue Live Nation over monopolistic control of the industry).\n\nU.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee grilled the Live Nation executive about the $20 billion company's inability to protect consumers -- and apparent unwillingness to report bad actors to the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThis year's state bill does not require bot reporting, nor does it include any financial penalties if the rules it describes are broken.\n\nIt also leaves \"holdback\" ticketing on the table, the practice of releasing tickets in batches to create a false sense of scarcity.\n\nPart of the lawmakers' goal in reshaping the bill was to create something that avoided igniting \"the most intense corporate passions of the Ticketmasters of the world by going after that holdback provision,\" said Representative Alex Valdez of Denver, one of the sponsors of the bill.\n\nPut more bluntly, holdbacks are \"the primary market secret sauce,\" Hess said.\n\nThe lack of bot enforcement and allowance of holdbacks were major sticking points in last year's bill, and eventually the provision that required venues to report suspected bots was scrapped from the final draft. Polis lamented this omission in his veto letter.\n\nAnd while disclosing the total cost of a ticket is a win for transparency, the bill wouldn't actually prohibit ancillary fees, which average around 27% in primary markets and 31% in secondary markets, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. So you could still get hit with service fees -- they'll just come as less of a surprise.\n\nSome of the biggest issues in event ticketing are still on the table. Bots are still botty, fraudulent websites are still fraud-y, and service fees aren't going anywhere. And even though a venue won't be able to turn you away if you unknowingly purchased a fake ticket, they can still kick you out if you violate their policies. Meaning that if you try to sneak a hula hoop or a bag of glitter into Red Rocks, security is coming for you.\n\nUltimately, the bill is viewed by most as a launchpad for stronger protections, and a temporary arrangement until federal-level protections are put into place.\n\n\"We're seeing movement at the federal level to hopefully get to a federal standard. So bills like this in Colorado may not be necessary in the future,\" said Stephen Parker, executive director of the National Independent Venues Association. \"But for now, the states are where the action is at. And ultimately, if there's gonna be consumer protection, it's gonna happen at the state level. The only question is: Is the consumer protection meaningful?\"", "source": {"uri": "coloradosun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Colorado Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Vote Now\n\nThe Maryland bill targeting speculative ticketing in the state was signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore today. The consumer protection bill focuses on the sale and resale of live event tickets and was supported by the Recording Academy, National Independent Venue Association (NIVA), National Independent Talent Organization (NITO), Eventbrite and more.\n\nThe bill bans speculative ticketing (the practice of listing tickets on secondary sites before a reseller owns a ticket), as well as require ticketers to present \"all in\" pricing for consumers, meaning the full price of the ticket -- including all fees -- must be present in the price first shown to fans. The law will go into effect on July 1.\n\n\"In addition to Senators [Dawn Danielle] Gile and [Pamela] Beidle and Delegate [C.T.] Wilson, we're also grateful to Marylanders who spoke out and let their elected officials know that they want protection from parasitic scalpers who use acts of deception to gouge concert fans,\" said Audrey Fix Schaefer, communications director of Merriweather Post Pavilion and I.M.P. in a statement. \"Nearly 17,000 letters were sent by Marylanders to their state legislators, letting those in Annapolis know they want protection from the rampant deception and abuse that's taking place now. We applaud the entire State legislature for this groundbreaking legislation, and we look forward to working with the Attorney General's office to help ensure enforcement.\"\n\nThe bill requires resellers to provide the zone and seat number for non-general admission events, eliminating the common practice of resellers listing an unspecified seat and procuring a ticket -- for a lesser price -- once a consumer has purchased the \"unspecified\" seat from a secondary site. It also reduces resellers' ability to list generic tickets on resale sites before on-sale for the actual event has occurred.\n\nA standout of the bill for proponents like NIVA, NITO and others, is that the bill makes it illegal for secondary ticketing platforms to provide a marketplace for the sale or resale of tickets that violate the law. If a consumer purchases a ticket that is counterfeit, canceled by the reseller or fails to meet its original description, the secondary platform would be responsible for paying the consumer back for the total amount paid, including any fees. Platforms selling or offering to sell speculative tickets can be fined up to $10,000 for the first infraction and $25,000 for each subsequent infraction.\n\nAdditionally, the bill mandates \"all-in\" ticket pricing -- where consumers see the full price of the ticket, including fees, from the beginning of their transaction -- and require those fees to be itemized so fans know where their dollars are going. The passage of the bill also means Maryland's attorney general's office can conduct a review of how resellers are procuring their tickets, the price difference for fans on the primary versus secondary market, fraudulent tickets, the use of bots, what measures other states have enacted to protect consumers during the ticket buying process and more.\n\nThe AG's study is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year.", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "taylor_mims@billboard.com", "name": "Taylor Mims", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Independent_Venue_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Independent Venue Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reseller", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reseller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Recording_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Recording Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriweather_Post_Pavilion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merriweather Post Pavilion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_House_of_Delegates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia House of Delegates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_resale", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ticket resale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Annapolis, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Annapolis, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketplace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procuring_(prostitution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Procuring (prostitution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterfeit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Counterfeit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Merriweather-Bill-Signing-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547938", "eventUri": "eng-9547938", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 753, "textEnd": 759}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

A third businessman pleaded guilty and testified against them. Menendez's wife has also pleaded innocent in the case, although her trial has been delayed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nSellinger testified last week that Menendez told him that if he recommended that he be appointed as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor, he hoped he'd take a look at a criminal case against Fred Daibes, a prominent New Jersey real estate developer, because he believed he \"was being treated unfairly.\"\n\nSellinger said he told Menendez the next day that he would have to notify the Justice Department that he might need to be recused from the Daibes case because he had worked on a lawsuit while in private practice that was adverse to Daibes.\n\nMenendez then recommended somebody else for the job, and Soliman testified Tuesday that he was told by a top Menendez aide in December 2020 that the senator and Sellinger \"had a falling out.\"\n\nSoliman said that after the appointment of the new candidate fell through after a series of negative news articles about her, Sellinger told him that he wanted the senator to know that he checked with the Justice Department and learned that \"the issue\" that he thought would require his recusal did not after all.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Richenthal asked Soliman if there was any confusion expressed by Menendez about what \"the issue\" was when he relayed the conversation to the senator.\n\n\"No,\" Soliman said.\n\nSoliman, who said he did not know what \"the issue\" was that Sellinger had referenced, also said Menendez did not ask any questions regarding the message Sellinger passed along.\n\nSellinger, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, was sworn in as U.S. attorney in December 2021 and has held the post ever since.\n\nSellinger, testifying last week, recalled his conversation with Soliman differently, claiming that he told Soliman exactly what he told the senator: that he expected he might be recused from the Daibes case because of the civil case he had worked on that was adverse to Daibes.\n\nSellinger said he called Menendez in spring 2022 to invite him to speak at a public ceremony celebrating Sellinger's appointment as U.S. attorney.\n\n\"He said: 'I'm going to pass,'\" Sellinger recalled.\n\nSellinger said the senator then said, \"The only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney and you don't.\"\n\nSellinger testified on cross examination last week and Tuesday in ways favorable to the senator, including saying he never believed Menendez had asked him to do anything improper or unethical.\n\nBuoyed by Sellinger's testimony on cross examination, Menendez left the courthouse Tuesday seeming upbeat, saying just before getting in his car, \"Sellinger made it very clear.

Last week, Sellinger told jurors about seeking Menendez's endorsement for the US attorney's post. He said the lawmaker said Daibes \"was being treated unfairly, and Senator Menendez hoped that if I became U.S. Attorney that I would look at it carefully.\"\n\nBut on cross-examination Tuesday, Sellinger said Menendez never pressured him or used aggressive language when they spoke in December 2020.\n\n\"I did not believe that he was asking me to do anything other than my official duty,\" Sellinger told New York federal jurors. \"I didn't believe he was asking me to do anything.\"\n\nMenendez attorney Avi Weitzman said: \"It's fair to say that he didn't ask you to put your thumb on the scales of justice?\" Sellinger agreed.\n\nProsecutors are seeking to prove that Menendez and Daibes entered into an illegal agreement, and that the senator recommended Sellinger, an old friend and fundraiser, for the prosecutor's post because he believed he could influence him in the Daibes case.\n\nThe U.S. charged Menendez, 70, with several bribery plots and acting as an agent of Egypt. He's on trial with Daibes and an Egyptian American businessman, Wael Hana. Another businessman who pleaded guilty, Jose Uribe, testified that he bribed Menendez's wife, Nadine, with a Mercedes Benz, so the senator would sway two criminal investigations in New Jersey.\n\nSellinger testified he told Menendez he would ask the Justice Department whether he needed to recuse himself because he had worked on private litigation in a case against Daibes.\n\nAfter that, Sellinger said, Menendez told him he would not endorse him for the job, preferring instead to go with a Hispanic prosecutor whose candidacy ultimately foundered. Menendez later endorsed Sellinger's nomination by President Joe Biden.\n\nBut Sellinger said their longtime friendship cooled because he chose to distance himself from elected officials after getting the job. After getting the post, Sellinger was recused from the case.\n\nThe Sellinger testimony came after a trial delay of several days because Daibes had Covid. Jurors have heard more than a dozen witnesses since testimony began on May 16. US District Judge Sidney Stein told jurors the trial could run until mid-July, even though they were initially told it would last six weeks.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2086709!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/p-senator-robert-menendez-exits-court-in-new-york-on-june-3-p.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663376", "eventUri": "eng-9663376", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-16", "textStart": 2653, "textEnd": 2659}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-12-", "textStart": 914, "textEnd": 927}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 243, "relevance": 1}

(AP Photo/Larry Neumeister)\n\nMenendez then recommended somebody else for the job, and Soliman testified Tuesday that he was told by a top Menendez aide in December 2020 that the senator and Sellinger \"had a falling out.\"\n\nSoliman said that after the appointment of the new candidate fell through after a series of negative news articles about her, Sellinger told him that he wanted the senator to know that he checked with the Justice Department and learned that \"the issue\" that he thought would require his recusal did not after all.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Daniel Richenthal asked Soliman if there was any confusion expressed by Menendez about what \"the issue\" was when he relayed the conversation to the senator.\n\n\"No,\" Soliman said.\n\nSoliman, who said he did not know what \"the issue\" was that Sellinger had referenced, also said Menendez did not ask any questions regarding the message Sellinger passed along.\n\nSellinger, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, was sworn in as U.S. attorney in December 2021 and has held the post ever since.\n\nSellinger, testifying last week, recalled his conversation with Soliman differently, claiming that he told Soliman exactly what he told the senator: that he expected he might be recused from the Daibes case because of the civil case he had worked on that was adverse to Daibes.\n\nSellinger said he called Menendez in spring 2022 to invite him to speak at a public ceremony celebrating Sellinger\u00b4s appointment as U.S. attorney.\n\n\"He said: 'I\u00b4m going to pass,\u00b4 \" Sellinger recalled.\n\nSellinger said the senator then said: \"The only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney and you don\u00b4t.\"\n\nSellinger testified on cross examination last week and Tuesday in ways favorable to the senator, including saying he never believed Menendez had asked him to do anything improper or unethical.\n\nBuoyed by Sellinger's testimony on cross examination, Menendez left the courthouse Tuesday seeming upbeat, saying just before getting in his car: \"Sellinger made it very clear. He was asked to do nothing wrong. And he didn\u00b4t.\"\n\nDabies, who is on trial with Menendez, contracted COVID last week, forcing a three-day delay in a trial that is now expected to stretch into July.

(Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/TNS)\n\nThe top federal prosecutor in New Jersey appeared to help Sen. Bob Menendez at his bribery trial Tuesday by telling jurors that the Democratic lawmaker never pressured him to do anything improper.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger testified at the trial of Menendez, 70, who is accused of taking bribes of gold bars, cash and a Mercedes Benz from businessmen seeking favors, including developer Fred Daibes.\n\nProsecutors say Menendez tried to influence the outcome of a separate fraud indictment in New Jersey of Daibes. Last week, Sellinger told jurors about seeking Menendez's endorsement for the U.S. attorney's post. He said the lawmaker said Daibes \"was being treated unfairly, and Senator Menendez hoped that if I became U.S. Attorney that I would look at it carefully.\"\n\nBut on cross-examination Tuesday, Sellinger said Menendez never pressured him or used aggressive language when they spoke in December 2020.\n\n\"I did not believe that he was asking me to do anything other than my official duty,\" Sellinger told New York federal jurors. \"I didn't believe he was asking me to do anything.\"\n\nMenendez attorney Avi Weitzman said: \"It's fair to say that he didn't ask you to put your thumb on the scales of justice?\" Sellinger agreed.\n\nProsecutors are seeking to prove that Menendez and Daibes entered into an illegal agreement, and that the senator recommended Sellinger, an old friend and fundraiser, for the prosecutor's post because he believed he could influence him in the Daibes case.\n\nThe U.S. charged Menendez with several bribery plots and with acting as an agent of Egypt. He's on trial with Daibes and an Egyptian American businessman, Wael Hana. Another businessman who pleaded guilty, Jose Uribe, testified that he bribed Menendez's wife, Nadine, with a Mercedes Benz so the senator would sway two criminal investigations in New Jersey. She faces a separate trial because she has cancer.\n\nSellinger testified he told Menendez he would ask the Justice Department whether he needed to recuse himself because he had worked on private litigation in a case against Daibes.\n\nAfter that, Sellinger said, Menendez told him he would not endorse him for the job, preferring instead to go with a Hispanic prosecutor, Esther Suarez, whose candidacy ultimately foundered after a series of unflattering news articles. Menendez later endorsed Sellinger's nomination by President Joe Biden.\n\nBut Sellinger said their longtime friendship cooled because he chose to distance himself from elected officials after getting the job. After getting the post, Sellinger was recused from the case. Daibes later pleaded guilty under a deal that would have brought him probation, but the judge in that case later tossed out the plea.\n\nAs he left the courthouse, Menendez said: \"Sellinger made it very clear -- he was asked to do nothing wrong and he did nothing wrong.\"\n\nThe Sellinger testimony came after a trial delay of several days because Daibes had COVID. Jurors have heard more than a dozen witnesses since testimony began last month. U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein told jurors the trial could run until mid-July, even though they were initially told it would last six weeks.\n\nAfter Sellinger testified, jurors heard from Michael Soliman, a top political adviser to the senator. Soliman said Menendez's former chief of staff, Fred Turner, told him in late 2020 that \"the senator and Mr. Sellinger had a falling out and the senator was going to go in a different direction.\"\n\nSoliman said he kept Menendez apprised of Suarez's sinking candidacy and how \"a lot of people didn't think she was the right person for the job.\"\n\nOn cross-examination, Weitzman suggested that Menendez considered Suarez because of a Biden directive to increase diversity for appointments like U.S. attorneys. He sought to defuse the allegation by prosecutors that Menendez recommended Sellinger's nomination by Biden for corrupt reasons.\n\nWeitzman asked if Sellinger had \"wide respect\" in the legal community and whether he was \"clearly qualified\" for the U.S. attorney post. Soliman agreed.\n\nSoliman also said that Menendez never told him that he asked Suarez about the Daibes case.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American

Menendez never pressured him", "body": "A top federal prosecutor handed Sen. Bob Menendez a lifeline at the New Jersey Democrat's corruption trial Tuesday, telling the court during cross examination that Menendez never asked or pressured him to act improperly on behalf of a political ally.\n\nPhilip Sellinger, now the US attorney for the District of New Jersey, said that in late 2020, he went to Menendez hoping for the senator's support in his bid to be nominated to the post. During the conversation, Sellinger testified, Menendez mentioned that Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer and co-defendant in the case, \"was being treated unfairly\" by prosecutors who had indicted him on bank fraud charges.\n\n\"Sen. Menendez hoped that if I became US attorney, that I would look at (the Daibes case) carefully,\" Sellinger said.\n\nThat testimony came up again Tuesday when Menendez attorney Avi Weitzman pressed Sellinger on the nature of that interaction.\n\n\"I did not believe that (Menendez) was asking me to do anything other than my official duty,\" Sellinger, a longtime friend and political supporter of Menendez, told the court. \"I didn't believe he was asking me to do anything.\"\n\nAt that, Weitzman asked Sellinger if it was \"fair to say that he didn't ask you to put your thumb on the scales of justice?\"\n\nSellinger nodded in agreement.\n\nNow in its sixth week, the trial has shifted its focus from allegations that Menendez, along with his wife, Nadine, accepted bribes from a New Jersey businessman to charges that the senator was part of a corrupt deal involving Daibes and the government of Qatar.\n\nThe trial resumed Tuesday following a three-day delay after Daibes tested positive for Covid-19 last week.\n\nThe Menendezes, Daibes and Egyptian American businessman Wael Hana are accused of engineering a complex and multifaceted bribery scheme. All four have pleaded not guilty.\n\nNadine Menendez will be tried separately this summer. A fifth alleged co-conspirator, Jose Uribe, pleaded guilty and testified for the government as a cooperating witness.\n\nSellinger was not initially recommended by Bob Menendez for the US attorney nomination, a decision prosecutors suggest was tied to his unwillingness to entertain the senator's concerns about the Daibes case. Sellinger testified last week that he told Menendez he would have to recuse himself from any issues relating to Daibes because of a past legal entanglement with the developer.\n\nFormer Menendez adviser Michael Soliman described the behind-the-scenes push for an alternative to Sellinger in his testimony Tuesday. Ultimately, Soliman said, Menendez decided to recommend then-Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez to the White House. But that choice faced harsh and immediate blowback centered on Suarez's handling of a rape accusation a volunteer for Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's 2017 campaign made against Murphy staffer Al Alvarez. Suarez did not bring charges against Alvarez, whom she had known for more than a decade.\n\nA subsequent probe by then-New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal found that Suarez had not acted inappropriately. (Grewal testified earlier in the trial that Menendez tried to meddle in a separate case, although he too said under cross-examination that the senator did not ask him to put his thumb on the scales of justice.)\n\nSoliman described to the court in excruciating detail his work to fend off critical press reports about Suarez and manage the public perception of Menendez, who was coming under fire for backing her. After a few ham-handed attempts by Suarez to defend herself to local media outlets and, eventually, the Biden administration's refusal to nominate her, Solimon said he and Menendez went searching for a \"Plan B.\"\n\nAround that point, in the spring or summer of 2021, Solimon said he had another conversation with Sellinger. This time, Sellinger told Solimon that he would not, after all, need to recuse himself from the Daibes case if he was nominated and confirmed. Sellinger, though, was having difficulty getting an audience with Menendez, so he passed the message along to Solimon, he testified.\n\n\"If you call Sellinger,\" Solimon said he told Menendez after the meeting, \"you'll be comfortable with what he says.\"\n\nWith Suarez's chances sunk, Menendez recommended Sellinger for the job he had wanted all along. The White House nominated Sellinger, who was confirmed and took office in December 2021. But in an about-face, Sellinger did recuse himself from the Daibes case.\n\nSolimon told the court that Menendez asked him to find out why Sellinger changed his mind, describing the senator as \"inquisitive\" and \"confused\" but not angry when told of the decision. Solimon told Menendez he would contact Sellinger, he testified, but never did.\n\nSellinger and Solimon would, however, eventually get together for a meal. But before they could sit down, Solimon recalled, Sellinger warned him against bringing up any specific, ongoing criminal case, telling him he would have to report anything of the sort to the Justice Department. Solimon said he never raised the Daibes case.\n\nMenendez, after being told about the interaction, expressed some regret, Solimon said.\n\n\"I'm sorry you had to go through that,\" he told his close aide, then dropped it.\n\nMenendez, though, remained frosty toward Sellinger, who testified that the senator rejected an invitation to his investiture ceremony.\n\n\"I'm going to pass,\" Menendez said, according to Sellinger, adding: \"The only thing worse than not having a relationship with the United States attorney is people thinking you have a relationship with the United States attorney - and you don't.\"\n\nProsecutors said in court Tuesday morning that they plan to rest their case on June 25. Defense lawyers said they hope to rest their case in time for the jury to be charged by the week of July 8.\n\nThere is no court Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday, and the trial will resume Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gregory_krieg@cnn.com", "name": "Gregory Krieg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts":

While in private practice at a major law firm, Sellinger had worked on what was basically a lawsuit against Daibes' real estate interests.\n\nMenendez's defense team has suggested Sellinger was sidelined because Biden's transition team was looking for diverse candidates.\n\nBut Soliman testified Sellinger had always been Menendez's first choice until Sellinger and the senator had a falling out.\n\nWhile Soliman didn't know what the falling out was about at the time, prosecutors are counting on jurors to fill in the blanks.\n\nSoliman testified that on Dec. 17, 2020, Menendez texted him looking to recommend someone other than Sellinger. That's the day after Sellinger told Menendez he might have to recuse himself from the Daibes case, according to Sellinger, who took the stand before Soliman.\n\nIt was only months later, after Menendez came to believe that Sellinger would not have to recuse himself, did the senator recommend Sellinger for the U.S. Attorney job, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn the meantime, Menendez had decided to back Esther Suarez, a local prosecutor, but her candidacy flamed out and Sellinger reentered the picture.\n\nHere Soliman's testimony conflicted with Sellinger's about the substance of a key phone call when it was clear Suarez was doomed.\n\nAccording to Sellinger, Sellinger used a call with Soliman to explain the process he might have to go through to recuse himself.\n\nAccording to Solimon, Sellinger was more pointed in the conversation. Soliman testified that Sellinger \"wanted me to let the senator know that he checked with [the Department of Justice] and that in fact he did not have to recuse himself from an issue.\"\n\nSoliman said he passed on the message to Menendez, though Soliman didn't know until January 2022 -- after Sellinger had taken office in December 2021 -- that the message had been about the Daibes case.\n\nBy then, though, Sellinger did end up having to recuse himself from the Daibes case -- which Soliman said left the senator confused and inquisitive about what Sellinger had said about not having to recuse himself and, eventually, frustrated with the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nBut, on the stand, Soliman had trouble recalling the exact nature of a key text message he sent the senator after he talked with Sellinger about recusal. In the message, Soliman wrote to Menendez that \"you'll be comfortable with what he says.\"\n\nProsecutors have suggested this was about recusal -- but Soliman said he wasn't sure and it might have referred to something else.\n\nThat failure of recollection is something of a blow to prosecutors' case. They found the statement so compelling that they included it in their indictment as a key piece of evidence about the alleged scheme.\n\nBut while Menendez may have had that legal victory on Tuesday, some of Soliman's testimony and the evidence that accompanied it could hurt Menendez's bid to hold onto his seat by running as an independent.\n\nIn particular, Soliman portrayed the senator's publicly reported intentions of recommending to Biden a diverse candidate for U.S. Attorney as a head fake.\n\nBefore mid-December 2020, for instance, Menendez had privately dismissed the idea that he would be recommending a Hispanic candidate to Biden.\n\nIn an email sent before the 2020 election, the senator said he worried that David Wildstein -- the admitted architect of the infamous Bridgegate scandal, who now runs a political news website in New Jersey -- would publish a story that suggested Menendez would help Biden nominate a Hispanic candidate for U.S. attorney.\n\n\"I hope he doesn't write the Hispanic idea,\" Menendez wrote in an email to Soliman, \"as it will only add pressure for me to do something which I don't intend to.\"\n\nEventually, Menendez would recommend a Hispanic candidate, Suarez, but only after he abandoned Sellinger in mid-December 2020.\n\nThat's when Menendez texted Soliman to do a little checking around about \"Salas,\" which may have been a misremembering or misspelling of \"Suarez.\"\n\nAfter that, Wildstein's site reported that Suarez was under consideration along with other names, including Jamel Semper, a prominent Black federal prosecutor.\n\nSoliman testified that other names, including Semper's, were floated so Suarez wasn't alone in getting scrutiny at the time. Soliman already expected she would get scrutiny for her handling of a politically sensitive investigation involving a former aide to Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nBut the plan didn't work, because Saurez's candidacy went down in flames amid press scrutiny. And floating Semper's name even backfired when a group of Black ministers came out in support of Semper -- who, Soliman testified, Menendez was never serious about recommending to Biden for the U.S. Attorney job.\n\nSoliman said Semper's name was floated because Wildstein had suggested the list of names Menendez's team was floating wasn't diverse enough.\n\nProsecutors showed an email from Menendez that seemed to confirm Soliman's account.\n\n\"This is just great,\" the senator wrote Soliman after the Black ministers came out in support of Semper, calling it a \"lesson why you can't let Wildstein drive your decisions.\"\n\nMenendez's defense team tried to suggest these unguarded messages were taken out of context and asked questions to suggest that Menendez did want to see Semper advanced either through promotion within the prosecutor's office or by getting a federal judgeship, which Semper later did with Menendez's help.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news",

Bob Menendez used the testimony of his former campaign manager on Tuesday to try to link alleged bribes of the Democrat to the appointment of New Jersey's top prosecutor three years ago.\n\nMichael Soliman, a former top Menendez political adviser, testified immediately after New Jersey's U.S. attorney, Philip R. Sellinger, finished two days on the witness stand at the Manhattan federal court trial that is in its sixth week.\n\nMenendez, 70, and two New Jersey businessmen are on trial on charges alleging the senator accepted gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and a luxury car from businessmen from 2018 to 2022 in return for helping them in their business dealings, including by trying to meddle in court cases.\n\nThey have pleaded not guilty. A third businessman pleaded guilty and testified against them. Menendez's wife has also pleaded not guilty in the case, although her trial has been delayed after she was diagnosed with breast cancer.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Bob Menendez's former top aides testified Tuesday that the senator was uniquely focused on a criminal case against a real estate developer now accused of bribing him.\n\nMichael Soliman, a key political adviser to the senator for over a decade, said the only criminal case Menendez ever asked him to talk to a prosecutor about involved the developer, Fred Daibes.\n\nMenendez and Daibes are now co-defendants in a sprawling federal corruption trial underway in New York federal court.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Menendez tried to disrupt a 2018 bank fraud case against Daibes because Daibes bribed the senator and his wife with cash, furniture and gold bars.\n\nAs part of that scheme, prosecutors allege that Menendez recommended President Joe Biden nominate the current U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Philip Sellinger, for the post in an attempt to influence the outcome of the Daibes case.\n\nProsecutors' theory is that Menendez originally wanted Sellinger, a close friend, for the job but then sidelined him because Sellinger said in late 2020 that he might have to recuse himself from the Daibes case. While in private practice at a major law firm, Sellinger had worked on what was basically a lawsuit against Daibes' real estate interests.\n\nMenendez's defense team has suggested Sellinger was sidelined because Biden's transition team was looking for diverse candidates.\n\nBut Soliman testified Sellinger had always been Menendez's first choice until Sellinger and the senator had a falling out.\n\nWhile Soliman didn't know what the falling out was about at the time, prosecutors are counting on jurors to fill in the blanks.\n\nSoliman testified that on Dec. 17, 2020, Menendez texted him looking to recommend someone other than Sellinger. That's the day after Sellinger told Menendez he might have to recuse himself from the Daibes case, according to Sellinger, who took the stand before Soliman.\n\nIt was only months later, after Menendez came to believe that Sellinger would not have to recuse himself, did the senator recommend Sellinger for the U.S. Attorney job, according to prosecutors.\n\nIn the meantime, Menendez had decided to back Esther Suarez, a local prosecutor, but her candidacy flamed out and Sellinger reentered the picture.\n\nHere Soliman's testimony conflicted with Sellinger's about the substance of a key phone call when it was clear Suarez was doomed.\n\nAccording to Sellinger, Sellinger used a call with Soliman to explain the process he might have to go through to recuse himself.\n\nAccording to Solimon, Sellinger was more pointed in the conversation. Soliman testified that Sellinger \"wanted me to let the senator know that he checked with [the Department of Justice] and that in fact he did not have to recuse himself from an issue.\"\n\nSoliman said he passed on the message to Menendez, though Soliman didn't know until January 2022 -- after Sellinger had taken office in December 2021 -- that the message had been about the Daibes case.\n\nBy then, though, Sellinger did end up having to recuse himself from the Daibes case -- which Soliman said left the senator confused and inquisitive about what Sellinger had said about not having to recuse himself and, eventually, frustrated with the U.S. Attorney's office.\n\nBut, on the stand, Soliman had trouble recalling the exact nature of a key text message he sent the senator after he talked with Sellinger about recusal. In the message, Soliman wrote to Menendez that \"you'll be comfortable with what he says.\"\n\nProsecutors have suggested this was about recusal -- but Soliman said he wasn't sure and it might have referred to something else.\n\nThat failure of recollection is something of a blow to prosecutors' case. They found the statement so compelling that they included it in their indictment as a key piece of evidence about the alleged scheme.\n\nBut while Menendez may have had that legal victory on Tuesday, some of Soliman's testimony and the evidence that accompanied it could hurt Menendez's bid to hold onto his seat by running as an independent.\n\nIn particular, Soliman portrayed the senator's publicly reported intentions of recommending to Biden a diverse candidate for U.S. Attorney as a head fake.\n\nBefore mid-December 2020, for instance, Menendez had privately dismissed the idea that he would be recommending a Hispanic candidate to Biden.\n\nIn an email sent before the 2020 election, the senator said he worried that David Wildstein -- the admitted architect of the infamous Bridgegate scandal, who now runs a political news website in New Jersey -- would publish a story that suggested Menendez would help Biden nominate a Hispanic candidate for U.S. attorney.\n\n\"I hope he doesn't write the Hispanic idea,\" Menendez wrote in an email to Soliman, \"as it will only add pressure for me to do something which I don't intend to.\"\n\nEventually, Menendez would recommend a Hispanic candidate, Suarez, but only after he abandoned Sellinger in mid-December 2020.\n\nThat's when Menendez texted Soliman to do a little checking around about \"Salas,\" which may have been a misremembering or misspelling of \"Suarez.\"\n\nAfter that, Wildstein's site reported that Suarez was under consideration along with other names, including Jamel Semper, a prominent Black federal prosecutor.\n\nSoliman testified that other names, including Semper's, were floated so Suarez wasn't alone in getting scrutiny at the time. Soliman already expected she would get scrutiny for her handling of a politically sensitive investigation involving a former aide to Gov. Phil Murphy.\n\nBut the plan didn't work, because Saurez's candidacy went down in flames amid press scrutiny. And floating Semper's name even backfired when a group of Black ministers came out in support of Semper -- who, Soliman testified, Menendez was never serious about recommending to Biden for the U.S. Attorney job.\n\nSoliman said Semper's name was floated because Wildstein had suggested the list of names Menendez's team was floating wasn't diverse enough.\n\nProsecutors showed an email from Menendez that seemed to confirm Soliman's account.\n\n\"This is just great,\" the senator wrote Soliman after the Black ministers came out in support of Semper, calling it a \"lesson why you can't let Wildstein drive your decisions.\"\n\nMenendez's defense team tried to suggest these unguarded messages were taken out of context and asked questions to suggest that Menendez did want to see Semper advanced either through promotion within the prosecutor's office or by getting a federal judgeship, which Semper later did with Menendez's help.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Bob Menendez's federal bribery trial in Manhattan by ripping back the curtain on the behind-the-scenes duplicity and media manipulation that observers have long suspected drives politics in New Jersey.\n\nMichael Soliman was state director of Menendez's Senate office for seven years, ran his 2013 re-election campaign, and served on and off as his political adviser until last fall.\n\nUnder questioning by prosecutor Daniel Richenthal, Soliman told jurors that he planted a false story in the press, coached Menendez on how to lie to people seeking political appointments, and vetted candidates for the senator with \"optics\" always driving his advice and actions.\n\n\"It was my job to protect the senator, so I just cared about his optics,\" said Soliman, a partner at Mercury Public Affairs.\n\nTuesday's questioning focused on just one part of the wide-ranging corruption scheme that has kept New Jersey's senior senator and co-defendants Fred Daibes and Wael Hana in court almost daily since mid-May -- the senator's alleged attempt to squash the U.S. Attorney's bank fraud prosecution of his friend Daibes, an Edgewater real estate developer and bank founder. Prosecutors say Daibes paid Menendez in cash and gold bars for his influence.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger testified last week that Menendez promised in 2020 to recommend him as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor. But the senator dropped him and chose another candidate, Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez, after Sellinger told Menendez that if he became U.S. attorney, he'd have to alert his new bosses that he once handled a case in which Daibes was an \"adverse party,\" a potential conflict of interest warranting his recusal.\n\nTuesday, Soliman spilled all sorts of secrets about the power of politics in who snags the top jobs in New Jersey. After Menendez asked him to vet Suarez, Soliman reported his findings in a text to the senator: \"She is a Stack person but also viewed as an ally to Donald, since she used to work at his firm. Also Sacco signed off on her because she agreed to take on Ralph Lamparello's wife as her top aide.\"\n\nStack is state Sen. Brian Stack; Donald is attorney Donald Scarinci, a childhood friend of Menendez; Sacco is former state Sen. Nicholas Sacco; and Ralph Lamparello is a past president of the New Jersey State Bar Association and a powerful Hudson County insider.\n\nSuarez's candidacy drew media scrutiny quickly, largely focused on her controversial decision not to prosecute a campaign staffer for Gov. Phil Murphy who had been accused of rape. When a Star-Ledger editor reached out to Soliman with questions critical of Suarez's candidacy, Soliman alerted Menendez, texting him that Suarez's lawyer planned to send a letter threatening the outlet, which published a column anyway.\n\nWhen New Jersey Globe editor David Wildstein told Soliman he planned to do a story on the U.S. attorney candidates, Soliman said he and Menendez had several concerns. They worried Suarez would be seen as a diversity hire, a \"hot button\" issue they wanted to avoid before the election, Soliman testified. And they wanted to divert attention from Suarez, whose negative publicity they worried could taint Menendez, he added.\n\n\"Please try and delay\" the story, the senator urged Soliman in a text sent on the encrypted app Signal.\n\nWildstein agreed to wait, Soliman said, but asked again the next month, after then-U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito's resignation left the job open. Soliman told jurors he gave Wildstein a list of candidates he said Menendez was considering for the job, including Jamel Semper, a prominent attorney the Black clergy subsequently championed and who later became a federal judge.\n\nBut the story that Menendez and Sen. Cory Booker were eyeing more than two candidates was wholly false, Soliman testified.\n\nSpecial report: Jose Uribe flipped. Here's why he bribed Bob Menendez with a new Mercedes\n\nMenendez never considered recommending anyone but Sellinger and then Suarez for the job, even though the White House requested at least three candidates, Soliman said.\n\nWhen the candidates followed up with Menendez to inquire about their chances, Soliman told jurors that he and the senator strategized what lies would best appease them -- and blamed the White House for not picking them.\n\nWhen the negative publicity dogging Suarez did not die down, Menendez began plotting \"a Plan B,\" he wrote in a text to Soliman that was presented to jurors.\n\nAbout that time, Sellinger and Soliman talked again, Soliman testified.\n\nSellinger told Soliman he'd talked to his new bosses and didn't have to recuse himself, Soliman said. That contradicts what Sellinger testified last Wednesday.\n\nAfter the White House dropped Suarez as a potential U.S. attorney, Menendez again recommended Sellinger, who got the job -- and told his bosses on his first day of potential conflicts in four cases. They ordered him recused from three, including Daibes'.\n\nMenendez was \"confused\" and asked Soliman to find out why Sellinger had been recused from Daibes' case after supposedly telling Soliman that he wouldn't be recused, Soliman testified. But Soliman told jurors he never asked Sellinger about Daibes when the men met for lunch.

Robert Menendez arrives for court on May 13, 2024 in New York City. Federal prosecutors accused Menendez and his wife of accepting thousands of dollars in bribes (Photo by Alex Kent/Getty Images)\n\nA political operative kicked off the sixth week of Sen. Bob Menendez's federal bribery trial in Manhattan by ripping back the curtain on the behind-the-scenes duplicity and media manipulation that observers have long suspected drives politics in New Jersey.\n\nMichael Soliman was state director of Menendez's Senate office for seven years, ran his 2013 re-election campaign, and served on and off as his political adviser until last fall.\n\nUnder questioning by prosecutor Daniel Richenthal, Soliman told jurors that he planted a false story in the press, coached Menendez on how to lie to people seeking political appointments, and vetted candidates for the senator with \"optics\" always driving his advice and actions.\n\n\"It was my job to protect the senator. So I just cared only about his optics,\" said Soliman, a partner at Mercury Public Affairs.\n\nTuesday's questioning focused on just one part of the wide-ranging corruption scheme that has kept New Jersey's senior senator and co-defendants Fred Daibes and Wael Hana in court almost daily since mid-May -- the senator's alleged attempt to squash the U.S. Attorney's bank fraud prosecution of his friend Daibes, an Edgewater real estate developer and bank founder. Prosecutors say Daibes paid Menendez in cash and gold bars for his influence.\n\nU.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger testified last week that Menendez promised in 2020 to recommend him as New Jersey's top federal prosecutor. But the senator dropped him and chose another candidate, Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez, after Sellinger told Menendez that if he became U.S. attorney, he'd have to alert his new bosses that he once handled a case in which Daibes was an \"adverse party,\" a potential conflict of interest warranting his recusal.\n\nTuesday, Soliman spilled all sorts of secrets about the power of politics in who snags the top jobs in New Jersey. After Menendez asked him to vet Suarez, Soliman reported his findings in a text to the senator: \"She is a Stack person but also viewed as an ally to Donald, since she used to work at his firm. Also Sacco signed off on her because she agreed to take on Ralph Lamparello's wife as her top aide.\"\n\nStack is state Sen. Brian Stack; Donald is attorney Donald Scarinci, a childhood friend of Menendez; Sacco is former state Sen. Nicholas Sacco; and Ralph Lamparello is a past president of the New Jersey State Bar Association and a powerful Hudson County insider.\n\nSuarez's candidacy drew media scrutiny quickly, largely focused on her controversial decision not to prosecute a campaign staffer for Gov. Phil Murphy who had been accused of rape. When a Star-Ledger editor reached out to Soliman with questions critical of Suarez's candidacy, Soliman alerted Menendez, texting him that Suarez's lawyer planned to send a letter threatening the outlet, which published a column anyway.\n\nWhen New Jersey Globe editor David Wildstein told Soliman he planned to do a story on the U.S. attorney candidates, Soliman said he and Menendez had several concerns. They worried Suarez would be seen as a diversity hire, a \"hot button\" issue they wanted to avoid before the election, Soliman testified. And they wanted to divert attention from Suarez, whose negative publicity they worried could taint Menendez, he added.\n\n\"Please try and delay\" the story, the senator urged Soliman in a text sent on the encrypted app Signal.\n\nWildstein agreed to wait, Soliman said, but asked again the next month, after then-U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito's resignation left the job open. Soliman told jurors he gave Wildstein a list of candidates he said Menendez was considering for the job, including Jamel Semper, a prominent attorney the Black clergy subsequently championed and who later became a federal judge.\n\nBut the story that Menendez and Sen. Cory Booker were eyeing more than two candidates was wholly false, Soliman testified.\n\nMenendez never considered recommending anyone but Sellinger and then Suarez for the job, even though the White House requested at least three candidates, Soliman said.\n\nWhen the candidates followed up with Menendez to inquire about their chances, Soliman told jurors that he and the senator strategized what lies would best appease them -- and blamed the White House for not picking them.\n\nWhen the negative publicity dogging Suarez did not die down, Menendez began plotting \"a Plan B,\" he wrote in a text to Soliman that was presented to jurors.\n\nAbout that time, Sellinger and Soliman talked again, Soliman testified.\n\nSellinger told Soliman he'd talked to his new bosses and didn't have to recuse himself, Soliman said. That contradicts what Sellinger testified last Wednesday.\n\nAfter the White House dropped Suarez as a potential U.S. attorney, Menendez again recommended Sellinger, who got the job -- and told his bosses on his first day of potential conflicts in four cases. They ordered him recused from three, including Daibes'.\n\nMenendez was \"confused\" and asked Soliman to find out why Sellinger had been recused from Daibes' case after supposedly telling Soliman that he wouldn't be recused, Soliman testified. But Soliman told jurors he never asked Sellinger about Daibes when the men met for lunch. That's because Sellinger warned him he'd have to report Soliman to the Department of Justice if he inquired about any ongoing criminal matters, Soliman testified.\n\nTestimony is expected to continue Wednesday morning in Manhattan, with an FBI agent scheduled to share more evidence. Prosecutors expect to wrap up their case by next Tuesday, and defense attorneys told Judge Sidney H. Stein they expect to take up to two weeks to present their side of the case.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Soliman_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walid Soliman (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Sacco", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas Sacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seniority_in_the_United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seniority in the United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squash_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Squash (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hudson County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hudson County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgewater,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edgewater, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edgewater, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Murphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Murphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey_State_Bar_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey State Bar Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wildstein", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Wildstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rape"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Carpenito", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Craig Carpenito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_H._Stein", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sidney H.

The conventional wisdom is out the window. The foundations of the state's power structure have been shaken and nobody knows if they're sound.\n\nOf course I'm referring to the NJEA's stunning decision to endorse its president, Sean Spiller, for governor.\n\nBut seriously, it's been a few days since Attorney General Matt Platkin announced the indictment of South Jersey Democratic boss George Norcross. And politicians' responses have been muted -- from both sides of the aisle.\n\nGov. Murphy had this to say: \"The charges, the allegations are very serious. They are deeply disturbing. Let there be no doubt about that. Period. Secondly, as I said about Senator Menendez, as disturbing as the allegations might be, this is America. Folks are innocent until proven guilty. And that's the way it should be. And thirdly I will likely have nothing else to say about this given it's an active law enforcement matter.\"\n\nBut notably, Murphy suggested that he'd continue to help raise money for Norcross' super PAC when asked. \"I've raised money for Democrats up and down this state and all across this country. And I'll continue to do so,\" he said.\n\nSeveral other Democrats have commented, including 7th Congressional candidate Sue Altman, long a Norcross foe. Andy Kim did, without naming Norcross. Steve Fulop has been aggressively bringing it up, seeking to draw out his likely 2025 gubernatorial rivals Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer. Sherrill later issued a pretty careful statement on the indictment. Gottheimer, by contrast, issued an attack on Fulop for \"flip-Fuloping\" and in his own statement said \"we must always respect the rule of law and hold people accountable\" without mentioning Norcross by name. Sen. Cory Booker told POLITICO that \"anytime you see public figures getting indicted it's a sad time for our state,\" saying he hadn't read the indictment yet and \" \"this is something that should be concerning.\" Not exactly scathing.\n\nNone of this suggests the indictment has done anything to weaken Norcross' grip on so much of New Jersey politics, even if it's waned from its peak during Chris Christie's administration.\n\nWhere are the Republicans? The lack of comment from prominent figures on the right over the indictment of one of the most powerful Democrats in the state shows that Norcross' influence and reputation extend beyond the Democratic Party. State Sen. Vince Polistina, who's been in a public spat with Norcross, was an exception when a caller asked him about it during a radio interview on WOND Wednesday. \"They're alleging that he weaponized government to facilitate private negotiations he was in for himself and his company,\" Polistina said. \"Everybody is innocent until proven guilty, but if they have tapes of all this stuff and he was trying to utilize the Camden city government to put pressure on developers to facilitate his private negotiations, that is not allowed, that is illegal, that is criminal and he's going to suffer the consequences.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it's business as usual in South Jersey. On Wednesday, without comment, the South Jersey Transportation Authority -- where two commissioners were charged Friday with voting against paying a vendor in an alleged Norcross-related retribution scheme -- approved a legal services contract for Brown & Connery, home to longtime Norcross attorney and confidante Bill Tambussi, who was also charged in the alleged Norcross \"criminal enterprise.\" The two charged commissioners, Christopher Milam and Bryan Bush, were absent. Gov. Murphy has final say over the action. Brown & Connery was the only bidder.\n\nTIPS? FEEDBACK? Email me at [email protected].\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \"I don't want to belabor that today ... Today is not what that's all about.\" -- Camden Mayor Vic Carstarphen when asked Wednesday about the Norcross indictment during a ceremony to highlight \"the removal of a massive pile of toxic soil\" that was definitely not intended to be symbolic.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY: Pearl Gabel, Zach McCue\n\nWHERE'S MURPHY? -- Leaving New Jersey tonight for \"personal travel\" and returning Sunday.\n\nCOME MR. SOLIMAN TELL ON MY BEHAVIOR -- Former Menendez aide testifies about gamesmanship around NJ's top federal prosecutor, by POLITICO's Ry Rivard: One of Sen. Bob Menendez's former top aides testified Tuesday that the senator was uniquely focused on a criminal case against a real estate developer now accused of bribing him. Michael Soliman, a key political adviser to the senator for over a decade, said the only criminal case Menendez ever asked him to talk to a prosecutor about involved the developer, Fred Daibes ... Soliman testified that on Dec. 17, 2020, Menendez texted him looking to recommend someone other than Sellinger. That's the day after Sellinger told Menendez he might have to recuse himself from the Daibes case, according to Sellinger, who took the stand before Soliman ...\n\nIt was only months later, after Menendez came to believe that Sellinger would not have to recuse himself, that the senator recommended Sellinger for the U.S. Attorney job, according to prosecutors. In the meantime, Menendez had decided to back Esther Suarez, a local prosecutor, but her candidacy flamed out and Sellinger reentered the picture. Here, Soliman's testimony conflicted with Sellinger's about the substance of a key phone call when it was clear Suarez was doomed. According to Sellinger, Sellinger used a call with Soliman to explain the process he might have to go through to recuse himself. According to Solimon, Sellinger was more pointed in the conversation. Soliman testified that Sellinger \"wanted me to let the senator know that he checked with [the Department of Justice] and that in fact he did not have to recuse himself from an issue.\"\n\n-- \"Adviser testifies about Menendez schemes to bully the press, blame the White House,\" by New Jersey Monitor's Dana DiFilippo: \"When New Jersey Globe editor David Wildstein told Soliman he planned to do a story on the U.S. attorney candidates, Soliman said he and Menendez had several concerns. They worried Suarez would be seen as a diversity hire, a \"hot button\" issue they wanted to avoid before the election, Soliman testified. And they wanted to divert attention from Suarez, whose negative publicity they worried could taint Menendez, he added. 'Please try and delay' the story, the senator urged Soliman in a text sent on the encrypted app Signal. Wildstein agreed to wait, Soliman said, but asked again the next month, after then-U.S. Attorney Craig Carpenito's resignation left the job open. Soliman told jurors he gave Wildstein a list of candidates he said Menendez was considering for the job, including Jamel Semper, a prominent attorney the Black clergy subsequently championed and who later became a federal judge. But the story that Menendez and Sen. Cory Booker were eyeing more than two candidates was wholly false, Soliman testified.\"\n\n-- \"Jose Uribe's sentencing set for Oct. 29; Fred Daibes bank fraud trial also scheduled\"\n\nATTN GEORGE NORCROSS -- Gov. Phil Murphy unveiled a wide-ranging clemency plan Wednesday and established an advisory board.\n\nMurphy timed the announcement of his executive order to coincide with Juneteenth, the holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. He said his initiative to issue pardons and commutations is designed to \"help address inequities and unfairness in our system of justice in New Jersey.\" It's the first type of clemency action Murphy has taken since becoming governor in 2018.\n\n\"This new clemency initiative is a cornerstone of our Administration's efforts to make New Jersey the State of Second Chances,\" he said in a statement. \"Today, we pledge to take a responsible and equity-driven approach to pardons and commutations that will prioritize the most compelling cases.\"\n\nThe order sets certain categories of offenses that will get \"expedited review\" for clemency. They include: non-violent convictions; \"excessive\" trial penalties; and victims of domestic or sexual violence or sex trafficking who are incarcerated for committing a crime against the perpetrator, Murphy said.\n\nThe Clemency Advisory Board includes a designee of the state attorney general and five public members. The board will review each clemency application and make recommendations to the governor.\n\nTHE PEOPLE WANT BIG JOE HENRY -- \"ELEC will decide if Spadea radio show counts against spending cap,\" by New Jersey Globe's David Wildstein: The New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission will conduct a review to determine if the fair market value of Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Spadea remaining on the air as the New Jersey 101.5 morning drive-time radio show will count against the $8.7 million spending cap if he chooses to participate in the state's public financing program. 'Until he becomes a legally qualified candidate, Bill will continue to fulfill his employment responsibilities entertaining and informing the local audience on NJ 101.5 airwaves and digital platforms, as he has done for the last nine years,' the company said in a statement.\"\n\n-- \"ELEC approves $8.7 million spending cap for gubernatorial primary\"\n\nNJ GOV AND LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE DEEP COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY -- \"Can NJ's opaque budget-making practices be overhauled?\" by NJ Spotlight News' John Reitmeyer: \"If legislative leaders and the governor stick to past practice, key decisions about the final budget -- including the fate of several tax hikes Murphy wants to enact alongside it -- will be made behind closed doors, and decided predominately by just the three men who hold the most powerful positions inside the State House. This largely opaque, final stage of New Jersey's annual budget-making process has drawn heavy criticism in recent years from people representing a wide swath of the political landscape, including conservative Republicans, progressive activists and racial-equity ... Among those bringing forward ideas to update the budget process have been Murphy and other recent candidates for governor, as well as policy experts from some of New Jersey's leading think tanks. Their proposals include calls to establish a \"cooling off\" period between when a final spending bill is drafted and voted on by the members of key legislative budget committees. Some have also suggested the Legislature itself should have a deadline for the formal introduction of the annual spending bill, just as the governor each year must generally reveal to lawmakers his latest budget vision before the end of February.\"\n\nTHINGS THAT MAKES YOU GO 'HMM' -- \"N.J. Turnpike Authority using eminent domain to acquire Bayonne's Marist land for $31.1M,\" by Hudson County View's John Heinis: \"The New Jersey Turnpike Authority is using eminent domain to acquire the former Marist High School land for $31,100,000, court documents of the proceedings show. A 128-page court filing in Hudson County Superior Court's Law Division, containing mostly legalese, quietly surfaced on April 15th, indicating that the NJPA would obtain 1241 John F. Kennedy Blvd. via condemnation ... In a December 5th, 2023 letter, Maurice Stack, the vice president of Stack, Coolahan & Stack, real property valuation and property tax consulting firm, said the property was purchased for $11.4 million by the LLC on December 17th, 2021.'\"My investigation revealed that this conveyance does not reflect the byproduct of an arm's length; market value transaction deemed instructive for appraisal purposes,' he wrote ... In March of last year, the New Jersey Comptroller's Office alleged in a lawsuit that the City of Bayonne ignored an Open Public Records Act (OPRA) request, and later a subpoena, about the Marist High School sale. On February 16th, 2022, the Bayonne City Council approved a redevelopment plan for the Marist High School property.\"\n\nMICHELLE, MA HELL -- \"Another summer of hell for riders? NJ Transit, Amtrak repair aging system,\" by The Record's Colleen Wilson: \"Michelle D. was one of the thousands of NJ Transit commuters who had an hours-long, hellish journey home recently after wires fell on the tracks a few miles from New York Penn Station ... Amid pushing and shoving, she eventually boarded another packed train out of Hoboken -- after almost getting smacked in the face by another rider's backpack -- only to have it stop at the next station because of a medical emergency. She was at the three-hour mark by then ... Over the course of just three days, NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters endured a litany of hours-long, haphazard commutes because of equipment failures along three bridges or tunnels whose average age is 105 and overhead wires, or catenary, that predates the 1950s. Journeying on aging, deteriorated and long-neglected infrastructure to get to and from New York Penn Station has -- yet again -- become a predictably unpredictable odyssey. And the end isn't near ... NJ Transit and Amtrak customers are trapped in this commuting purgatory for at least another 10 years as the decades-old assets on the notorious 10-mile stretch of rail between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station slowly get replaced, repaired and reinforced.\"\n\n-- \"In a state notorious for political scandal, signs of change emerge\"\n\n-- \"'Are you threatening me?'

'Taxpayer funds' did not pay for alcoholic beverages because 'no alcohol was served,' Le\u00f3n said in a brief phone conversation with TAPinto Newark.

While an April 15 contract between the district and the venue shows the cost to the district at $50,238.50 for the June 1 event at Forest Lodge in Warren, a subsequent invoice dated the day of the event puts the cost at $43,813.90, the figure Deering referenced.

Bob Menendez Bribery Trial - Prosecutor's Highlight", "body": "Sen. Bob Menendez is facing a bribery trial, accused of accepting gold bars, cash, and a luxury car in exchange for political favors. Key testimonies and defense strategies are shaping the case, along with Menendez's defense shifting the blame to his wife.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nThe Alleged Bribes and Key Witnesses\n\nProsecutors in Sen. Bob Menendez's bribery trial have presented important testimonies to support their case against the New Jersey senator.\n\nMichael Soliman, a former top adviser to Menendez, testified to help connect the senator to alleged bribes involving the appointment of New Jersey's top prosecutor.\n\nThe trial, now in its sixth week in Manhattan federal court, accuses Menendez of accepting gold bars, large amounts of cash, and a luxury car from businessmen between 2018 and 2022. These bribes were allegedly in return for political favors.\n\nMenendez, along with two businessmen, has pleaded not guilty. A third businessman has pleaded guilty and testified against them.\n\nMenendez's wife, Nadine, also faces charges, though her trial is delayed due to a breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe Testimony of U.S. Attorney Philip Sellinger\n\nPhilip Sellinger, the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, provided key testimony about conversations with Menendez.\n\nSellinger said Menendez suggested he look into a case involving Fred Daibes, a New Jersey real estate developer, due to perceived unfair treatment.\n\nSellinger, mentioning a potential conflict of interest from previous work, informed Menendez that he might need to step aside from that particular case.\n\nFollowing Sellinger's testimony, Soliman stated that Menendez and Sellinger had a disagreement over the recusal issue.\n\nDespite this, Sellinger confirmed during cross-examination that Menendez never asked him to do anything improper or unethical, which helped Menendez's defense.\n\nDefense Strategy: Blaming Nadine Menendez\n\nMenendez's defense strategy involves shifting blame to his wife, Nadine. This approach, however, comes with risks.\n\nLegal experts warn that jurors are not likely to fall for this, especially when it involves a spouse.\n\nMenendez's attorneys argue that the couple led mostly separate lives, with Menendez unaware of his wife's financial issues.\n\nChallenges and Key Testimonies Against the Defense\n\nDespite the defense's efforts, testimony from witnesses like Jose Uribe complicates Menendez's strategy.\n\nUribe, who pleaded guilty to bribing Menendez, testified that he directly asked the senator for help to stop a criminal investigation.\n\nThis challenges the defense's claim that Nadine acted alone. Additionally, evidence like the discovery of large amounts of cash and gold bars in the Menendez home further weakens his argument.\n\nSimilar Past Cases and Their Influence\n\nThe defense strategy resembles the case of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who blamed his wife for their acceptance of bribes, citing a troubled marriage.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court eventually overturned McDonnell's conviction, the tactic remains controversial and could backfire with jurors.\n\nWhat's Next for Menendez's Defense?\n\nAs the trial continues, Menendez's legal team must convince jurors of the senator's innocence while managing the complexities of their defense strategy.\n\nThe decision on whether Menendez will testify is crucial and could greatly influence the trial's outcome.\n\nThe prosecution's focus on Menendez's relationship with his wife and their involvement in each other's lives will matter in the jury's final decision.", "source": {"uri": "centraljersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "centraljersey.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_disqualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judicial disqualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_of_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conflict of interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-examination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cross-examination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_McDonnell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob McDonnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace_and_Defense/Defense", "label": "dmoz/Business/Aerospace and Defense/Defense", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://centraljersey.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Inside-The-Bribery-Trial-Of-Sen-Bob-Menendez_FI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663376", "eventUri": "eng-9663376", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Bob Menendez's curiosity about their price takes central role at bribery trial", "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors showed jurors at Sen. Bob Menendez 's trial on Thursday multiple instances when he researched the value of gold as he tried to help a New Jersey businessman who authorities say bribed him with gold and cash.\n\nThe evidence about the Democrat's online searches was prominently displayed to a New York jury as prosecutors traced the history of his text messages and internet queries as he allegedly tried to aid Fred Dabies, a prominent New Jersey real estate developer who is on trial with him.\n\nThe evidence is considered crucial in the government's effort to prove that Menendez and his wife received gold bars, cash and a luxury car from 2018 to 2022 from three New Jersey businessmen who benefited from favors Menendez allegedly delivered in return.\n\nMenendez, Dabies and another businessman and codefendant, Wael Hana, have pleaded not guilty. His wife, Nadine Menendez, faces trial at a later date after she recovers from breast cancer surgery. She too has pleaded not guilty.\n\nA third businessman pleaded guilty prior to trial and testified against the other defendants before the trial entered its sixth week in Manhattan federal court.\n\nThe gold bars found in the home Menendez shared with his wife in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, took a prominent role early in the trial when an FBI agent described a 2022 search of the residence the senator moved into after the couple was married in 2020, two years after they began dating.\n\nThe search found gold bars worth more than $100,000 and over $486,000 in cash, some stuffed in the pockets of coats hanging in closets or in shoes and boots. A Mercedes-Benz that prosecutors say was a bribe was parked in the garage.\n\nOn Thursday, the topic of gold came up repeatedly as another FBI agent described internet searches Menendez conducted when he researched the price of gold in April 2019, twice in May 2021, again in October 2021, twice in December 2021, once in January 2022 and again in March and May 2022.\n\nAmong the searches, Agent Paul Van Wie said, were instances when Menendez researched the worth of a gram, an ounce and a kilo of gold. The agent said a search of Menendez's internet history since 2008 showed that the senator had never searched for gold prices during that span until April 5, 2019.\n\nDefense lawyers have said gold bars found in the home belonged to Nadine Menendez and that she kept the senator in the dark about gifts she accepted when she was strapped for cash.\n\nProsecutors sought to prove Thursday through emails, text messages and the online searches for the price of gold that Menendez was interested in gold as he allegedly sought to recommend a new federal prosecutor for New Jersey who could help Dabies get a favorable outcome to a criminal case against him.\n\nThe online searches also occurred as Menendez allegedly used his international clout to help Dabies secure a $95 million investment from a Qatari investment fund by taking actions favorable to Qatar's government.\n\nDaibes has been credited with the construction of a string of luxury waterfront buildings, known as the \"gold coast,\" in the New Jersey town of Edgewater.\n\nProsecutors showed the jury email and text correspondence Thursday reflecting that Menendez introduced Daibes to a member of Qatar's royal family who was a principal in the investment firm and also met with Qatari officials and made public statements supportive of Qatar as the real estate deal was being negotiated.\n\nAfter the deal was signed in May 2022, prosecutors say, Daibes gave Menendez at least one gold bar.\n\nIn the 2022 search of the Menendez home, FBI agents found two 1-kilogram gold bars and nine 1-ounce gold bars with serial numbers showing they had previously been possessed by Daibes, along with about 10 envelopes of cash with tens of thousands of dollars bearing the fingerprints or DNA of Daibes, according to the evidence shown to jurors.\n\nIn August 2021, evidence shown to the jury Thursday showed, Menendez used an encrypted messaging application to send Daibes the text of a press release in which he praised the government of Qatar, before texting Daibes: \"You might want to send to them. I am just about to release.\"\n\nWhen Menendez was charged last fall, he held the powerful post of chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a position he relinquished after he was charged. He has resisted calls, including from prominent Democrats, that he resign from the Senate.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bob Menendez's federal corruption trial has a new sentencing date after entering a guilty plea to seven charges and agreeing to cooperate with federal prosecutors.\n\nJose Uribe, one of the three businessmen who was originally indicted with Menendez and his wife, faced a delayed sentencing due to the postponement of Nadine Arslanian Menendez's court case.\n\nUribe was initially scheduled to be sentenced June 14 but will now appear before a judge on Oct. 29. He was charged alongside the senator last fall but entered a guilty plea after making a plea deal with federal prosecutors.\n\nAlso charged with Menendez, Arslanian Menendez and Uribe were Bergen County developer Fred Daibes and Wael Hana, an Egyptian-American businessman.\n\nUribe spent several days last week on the stand as a witness for the prosecution and admitted to bribing the senator.\n\nUribe changed his not guilty plea to guilty on seven charges in March, including conspiracy to commit bribery and wire fraud.\n\nAccording to a plea agreement, Uribe could face up to 95 years in prison, though he could win leniency by cooperating and testifying against the other defendants, which he's agreed to do.\n\nDaibes trial scheduled\n\nThe week Uribe will be sentenced will also see a new trial for Daibes for a separate bank fraud case that is related with the Menendez charges.\n\nSix years after he was first indicted, Daibes' bank fraud cause is scheduled to begin on Oct. 22.\n\nMenendez's indictment shed light on the Democrat's alleged interference with Daibes' bank fraud charges. Prosecutors said the senator recommended that President Joe Biden nominate a U.S. attorney whom he believed could influence the case in Daibes' favor.\n\nAn updated indictment of Menendez and Daibes, released this month, alleged that Menendez was also working with Daibes and Qatar.\n\nThe initial indictment, released last fall, made it seem as if Daibes made payments solely to get Menendez to intervene in the bank fraud case.\n\nBut the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York now alleges Menendez was multitasking for Daibes -- by also publicly praising Qatar to entice a Qatari sheik to invest in a property Daibes owns. In exchange, Daibes allegedly gave Menendez bribes in the form of cash and gold bars.\n\nDaibes admitted last year to receiving more than $1 million in gross receipts from Mariner's Bank, the Edgewater-based lender where he once served as chairman. He pleaded guilty to making false entries in a loan memorandum. His sentencing hearing was delayed four times.\n\nDaibes pleaded guilty to a single count of the original 14-count indictment, which cited a 2008 memo for a $1.8 million nominee loan that falsely identified the borrower and the source of repayment. The line of credit was actually for Daibes, who funded the repayment, prosecutors said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_sobko@yahoo.com", "name": "Katie Sobko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kristie_cattafi@yahoo.com", "name": "Kristie Cattafi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Menendez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bob Menendez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mateus_Uribe", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mateus Uribe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_and_wire_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mail and wire fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen_County,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bergen County, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bergen County, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/G0l5prm7Bf3kSlJHOz8MkA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04ODQ7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-bergen-record/1d813addcc0a9f69002b9d0bdce76aae", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9663376", "eventUri": "eng-9663376", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-14", "textStart": 428, "textEnd": 435}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-29", "textStart": 474, "textEnd": 481}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-22", "textStart": 1449, "textEnd": 1456}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

The UK Foreign Office said on Friday that David Cameron, the former British prime minister who now serves as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, had exchanged a \u201cnumber of text messages\u201d and had a \u201cbrief video call\u201d with a man pretending to be Petro Poroshenko, the former president of Ukraine, who led the country between 2014 and 2019. Lord Cameron reportedly became wary of the prankster after the imposter Poroshenko had asked for the contact details of other senior British ministers upon which the foreign secretary ended the call, which is said to have occurred within the past few days, The Telegraph reports. In a statement, the Foreign Office said: \u201cWhilst the video call clearly appeared to be with Mr Poroshenko, following the conversation the Foreign Secretary became suspicious. \u201cContact details for others were requested and, given his concerns, the Foreign Secretary stopped responding. \u201cThe department has now investigated and confirmed that it was not genuine and that the messages and video call were a hoax.\u201d How do governments keep falling for this?https://t.co/fTikZEp5bZ \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 23, 2022 The incident is not the first time that top ranking British government officials have been duped by prank phone calls in recent years. In 2022, then-Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was duped into speaking with a pair of Russian pranksters believed to be in the employ of the Kremlin. The same duo had previously tricked former Home Secretary Priti Patel and ex-Culture Secretary Nadine Dories into speaking with them under false pretences. The government decided to go public with the latest prank against Lord Cameron in order to warn others and to undercut attempts to manipulate video footage of Lord Cameron from the call. \u201cWe are making this public in case the video of the Foreign Secretary is manipulated and subsequently used, and to ensure that others are aware of this risk.\u201d \u201cWhilst regretting his mistake, the Foreign Secretary thinks it important to call out this behaviour and increase efforts to counter the use of misinformation.\u201d Follow Kurt Zindulka on X: Follow @KurtZindulka or e-mail to: kzindulka@breitbart.com", "summary": "<p>David Cameron was duped into a prank phone call from a hoaxer purporting to be a former Ukrainian president, the UK government admitted.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/08/david-cameron-duped-into-prank-call-with-imposter-ex-ukraine-president-uk-admits/\">David Cameron Duped into Prank Call with Imposter Ex-Ukraine President, UK Admits</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.breitbart.com\">Breitbart</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2024/06/08/david-cameron-duped-into-prank-call-with-imposter-ex-ukraine-president-uk-admits/", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/06/GettyImages-2153561854-1-640x335.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:12:13", "author": "Kurt Zindulka", "authors": ["Kurt Zindulka"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.544}

{"id": 243289074, "title": "What Is &#39;Brat Summer?&#39; Everything You Need to Know About the Charli XCX-Inspired Neon Green Trend", "text": "Have you heard? It\u2019s Brat summer. That\u2019s according to English pop star Charli XCX, who recently released her sixth studio album Brat \u2014 as well as her devoted fanbase, who call themselves \u201cAngels.\u201d Have you seen a proliferation of neon green? Baby tees? Sporty sunglasses, especially while out on the town? It\u2019s Brat summer. After Angels adopted the term following the Brat album drop on June 7, the \u201cBoom Clap\u201d singer, 31, helped clarify its meaning in an interview on the BBC Sounds podcast. \u201cIt can go that way \u2014 quite like luxury,\u201d said Charli, responding to a question about whether a recent photo of the star on a speedboat qualified as part of the trend. \u201cBut it can also be so trashy, just like a pack of cigs and a BIC lighter and a strappy white top with no bra.\u201d Across TikTok, fans have scoured the lyrics of the new album for indications of the kinds of accessories entailed in a Brat summer: digital cameras, cropped T-shirts, anything that falls under the coquette aesthetic. But perhaps most fundamental to the look of a Brat summer is an iconic shade of neon green, which Charli chose to be the backdrop to her album cover in a controversial move earlier this summer. After internet blowback when she revealed the album art, she responded to criticism by questioning why fans felt so much \"ownership over female artists\" that they expect their likeness on an album cover. Beyond the accessorizing, reminiscent of Y2K and indie sleaze fashion trends, Brat summer is a state of mind \u2014 being an \u201cIt\u201d girl, but doing it effortlessly. In the music video for the alt-pop star\u2019s breakout single \u201c360\u201d from Brat, she enlisted the help of several It girls past and present, including the likes of Chlo\u00eb Sevigny, Julia Fox, Gabbriette Bechtel, Rachel Sennott, Chloe Cherry and Richie Shazam. The video even features internet star Emma Chamberlain \u2014 the queen of messy buns and oversized sweatshirts while also interviewing stars as a three-time red carpet correspondent at the Met Gala. Charli, herself, has embodied effortless It girl persona throughout her album campaign: At a Los Angeles show to promote the record, the star told the audience mid-song, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to sing this one. I just want you to f---ing sing this one while I drink wine, OK?\u201d Even the album cover \u2014 a plain green background with blurry, basic font spelling out the album name \u2014 gives a blas\u00e9 feel to the promotion cycle of the record, as if Charli is never taking anything too seriously, and neither should you. But Brat summer has also been defined by another key facet: unapologetic pettiness. Across the album, which she called her \u200b\u201cmost aggressive and confrontational record\u201d in an interview with The Face, Charli isn\u2019t afraid to speak on those she has qualms with. \u201cI think that I can be bitchy, but I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m a bitch,\u201d the singer said on the Las Culturistas podcast earlier in June. \u201cI don\u2019t think that you become a bad feminist if you maybe don\u2019t see eye-to-eye with every single woman. That\u2019s just not the nature of human beings.\u201d Throughout her song \u201cMean girls,\u201d Charli praises a little bad behavior \u2014 breaking your boyfriend\u2019s heart and using your \u201crazor-sharp tongue.\u201d \u201cI kinda miss the time where pop music was really volatile and crazy,\u201d told The Face. \u201cI miss the Paris Hilton days. Everybody is so worried about everything right now, how they\u2019re perceived, if this art they\u2019ve created is going to offend.\u201d On \u201cSympathy is a knife,\u201d she laments, \u201cI don't wanna share the space\u201d because \u201cthis one girl taps my insecurities.\u201d She later continues: \u201cDon't wanna see her backstage at my boyfriend's show / Fingers crossed behind my back / I hope they break up quick.\u201d (Some have speculated the song is about former tourmate Taylor Swift or actress Chloe Bennet, as both of them have been linked to men in Charli\u2019s fianc\u00e9 George Daniel's band The 1975.) But Brat summer should also be about squashing unnecessary beef, as Charli and Lorde did when they dropped the remix to the much discussed \u201cGirl, so confusing.\u201d Prior to the new version of the song, fans had speculated that the Brat track \u2014 which discusses Charli\u2019s frustration over a friend failing to follow through with plans to collaborate on music or spend time together \u2014 was about Lorde, given a line that says they have \u201cthe same hair.\u201d But the pair \u201cworked it out on the remix,\u201d where Lorde admits that she was intimidated by the English performer but has always respected her as an artist. (\"I ride for you, Charli,\" the \u201cRoyals\u201d singer declares at the end of her verse.) So bring your neon green and a little bit of shade \u2014 because it\u2019s Brat summer.", "summary": "On pop aficionado Charli XCX&#39;s latest album, she teaches you how to be an &#34;It&#34; girl \u2014 and do it effortlessly", "url": "https://people.com/what-is-brat-summer-charli-xcx-8671232", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/4NKKGrNMlWLVNuDcFoNAMYLEwWc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(775x331:777x333)/Charli-XCX-062724-6ce4444671324be18b45fb4cce478984.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 03:30:29", "author": "Luke Chinman", "authors": ["Luke Chinman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.256}

Swiatek set up a crucial semi-final clash against Coco Gauff, maintaining her strong form on clay with 17 consecutive victories. Her tactical approach will be key against Gauff.\n\nDefending champion Iga Swiatek declared that she was in the zone as her quest for a fourth French Open title hit top gear after a 6-0 6-2 victory over former runner-up Marketa Vondrousova sent her through to the semi-finals on Tuesday. The 23-year-old's 62-minute workout set up a seismic last-four encounter with American Coco Gauff in a repeat of the 2022 final won by the Pole who will look to improve her 10-1 overall record against the third seed.\n\n\"Today it was pretty straightforward. I'm happy that I kept my focus. Sometimes I felt the game was pretty intense,\" Swiatek said after making the Roland Garros semi-finals for the fourth time in five years. \"Sometimes the intensity went down a bit. I wanted to just play my game no matter what was coming back from Marketa. I felt like I was in the zone today.\"\n\nSwiatek wasted little time to start firing in the clash of reigning Grand Slam champions on Court Philippe Chatrier as she built a 5-0 lead over Wimbledon winner Vondrousova and wrapped up the opening set when the fifth seed hit a shot long. It was the top seed's third bagel in a row following her demolition of Russian Anastasia Potapova and she achieved it by dictating points from all parts of the court to completely overwhelm 2019 finalist Vondrousova.\n\nThe Czech cut a frustrated figure but finally got on board in the second set following a rare Swiatek mistake and earned a break point in the next game, but could not stop her ruthless rival from extending her winning run on clay to 17 matches. Madrid and Rome champion Swiatek broke for a 3-1 lead and never looked back, sealing victory when Vondrousova hit a shot into the net, and she quickly turned her attention to Gauff.\n\n\"It's good to keep going and not think of this match as something huge,\" Swiatek said. \"Against Coco it isn't easy. She really likes clay, especially here. I'll just focus on myself and I'll prepare tactically and we'll see.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade Roland Garros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bagel (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Potapova", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anastasia Potapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Field_Crops", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Field Crops", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling_Compounds", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Modeling Compounds", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/30_05_2024_10_36_30_502772.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622368", "eventUri": "eng-9622368", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

In what was a highly-thrilling match in which Swiatek saved a match point and recovered from a 2-5 third-set deficit, the French Open crowd got extremely excited and entertained - which led to stuff that the Polish world No. 1 didn't appreciate much.\n\n\"I have huge respect for you guys and I know we are playing for you, but sometimes under a lot of pressure when you scream something during the rally, it's really hard to be focused,\" Swiatek told the crowd after the Osaka match.\n\n\"I usually don't bring this up because I want to be a player that's in the zone and focused. But this is serious for us. We're fighting our whole lives to be better and better. Sometimes it's hard to accept that. The stakes are big. There's a lot of money to win. Losing a few points may change a lot\n\n\"Please, guys, if you can support us between the rallies but not during, that would be great. I hope you're still gonna like me because I know the French crowd might get some players they don't like and boo. But I love you guys and always love playing here, so let's continue that.\"\n\nSince surviving the Osaka challenge, Swiatek has played two more matches at Roland Garros. After ousting Marie Bouzkova 6-4 6-2, Swiatek earned her career-fourth double-bagel win after destroying Anastasia Potapova 6-0 6-0.\n\nFollowing her latest French Open win and securing a quarterfinal ticket, Swiatek was asked if she had anything new to say about the crowd. The 23-year-old Pole then proceeded to praise the French Open crowd but also acknowledged that her pretty dominant win over Potapova also may have played a part in why they were pretty quiet.\n\n\"I think the crowd was calmer also because I didn't play such a high-intensity match as against Naomi because obviously that was like a popcorn kinda match and everybody was really excited and pumped up for it. In this next one, I felt like I had everything under control so I think the crowd felt that,\" Swiatek said of the crowd after ousting Potapova.\n\n\"Yeah, people are listening, they are respectful so I felt a difference but I don't know what's the reason. I hope they kinda accepted my little speech after the match and they are not mad at me.\"\n\nSwiatek - who turned 23 on Friday - registered her fourth win with a 6-0 6-0 scoreline on Sunday when she beat Potapova. Not only that Swiatek earned one of the most dominant wins of her career against Potapova, but she also registered the fastest win of her career - the Pole needed just 40 minutes to saw off the Russian.\n\nDuring the entire match, Swiatek didn't face a single break point while Potapova didn't have a single game point. Also, the four-time Grand Slam champion won 48-of-58 points that were played during the match.\n\nWhile Swiatek earning a very dominant win is nothing new, this one even stunned the Pole a little bit.\n\n\"I mean it felt he same but I was just really focused and really in the zone and wasn't really looking at the score so I just continued playing my game and continued to work on the stuff I wanted to work on and it went quickly. Pretty weird,\" Swiatek admitted.\n\nOn Tuesday, fans will have a chance to watch two Grand Slam champions take on each other when Swiatek meets reigning Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.\n\nWhen Swiatek, 23, and 24-year-old Vondrousova meet at Roland Garros, it will be their fourth meeting and also their second meeting on clay. Interestingly, the first meeting between Swiatek and Vondrousova came at the 2020 French Open. Back then, Swiatek defeated Vondrousova 7-6 (2) 6-0 and then went on to win her first Grand Slam title at Roland Garros this year.\n\nLast year, Swiatek and Vondrousova met twice as the Pole overcame the Czech 7-6 (3) 6-1 in Cincinnati and also claimed a 7-6 (3) 6-0 win at the WTA Finals to improve to 3-0 in their head-to-head.\n\nSwiatek is again the favorite and it will be a big surprise if Vondrousova manages to end the Pole's French Open three-peat hopes.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dzevad_mesic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Dzevad Mesic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Potapova", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anastasia Potapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Osaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Bouzkov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marie Bouzkov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WTA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Masters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Masters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Clans_and_Guilds", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Clans and Guilds", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Pole_Vault", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Pole Vault", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image149541.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622368", "eventUri": "eng-9622368", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

No. 1 Swiatek followed in Court Philippe Chatrier with a 6-0, 6-2 victory against Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova to stretch her Roland Garros winning streak to 19 matches as she seeks a third trophy in a row in Paris and fourth in five years.Gauff won her first major title at the U.S. Open in September, then made it to the semifinals at the Australian Open in January.

In addition to being a Grand Slam champion, she was a finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, won a silver medal at the Tokyo Olympics and is currently ranked No. 6.But she never stood a chance against Swiatek, who compiled 25 winners to just 10 unforced errors.

In her fourth-round French Open match, Swiatek achieved tennis perfection against Anastasia Potapova. She played 12 games. She won all of them. A 6-0, 6-0 double-bagel blowout is the dream of every tennis player in an individual match. It is rarely achieved in any circumstance, but doing so in the fourth round of a major tournament gives Swiatek, the No. 1 seed and tournament favorite, extra rest heading into the quarterfinals.\n\nThat point aside, Swiatek's 40-minute victory is a lesson to parents who are considering which sport they might want their daughter to play. In tennis, if you can be really good, you can make multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars in 40 minutes. That's what Swiatek did on Sunday. That fourth-round win was worth just under $180,000. Swiatek has made $452,000 in the tournament by winning four matches and reaching the quarterfinals. Few sports have a better minutes-to-dollars ratio than tennis.\n\nNow Swiatek should expect to have a much, much tougher battle in the quarters against Marketa Vondrousova. The casual sports fan might not know much about Vondrousova, but she's the reigning Wimbledon champion and a former French Open finalist in 2019. She's the No. 5 seed. She's really good.\n\nHere are the Iga Swiatek-Marketa Vondrousova French Open odds, courtesy of FanDuel.\n\nFrench Open Odds: Iga Swiatek-Marketa Vondrousova Odds\n\nTime: Approx. 6:30 a.m. ET / 3:30 a.m. PT -- could be 30 to 60 minutes later depending on length of prior match\n\n*Watch Iga Swiatek-Marketa Vondrousova LIVE on fuboTV (click for a free trial)*\n\nWhy Iga Swiatek Could Cover The Spread\n\nThe champion at Roland Garros just won a 6-0, 6-0 match. The game spread for that match against Potapova was 7.5 games. Swiatek covered it with great ease. She is the best female clay-court player in the world by a large margin. We can debate non-clay, because Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff have recently won hardcourt major titles at the Australian and United States Opens, but we can't debate clay. This is Swiatek's fortress. It's hard to bet against her on the court she loves the most, and where she has forged most of her special achievements as a tennis player.\n\nWhy Marketa Vondrousova Could Cover The Spread\n\nSwiatek just played a very easy match. Typically, when a tennis player plays a really easy match -- with no challenge from her opponent -- the next match is at least somewhat more difficult. Vondrousova doesn't have to win a set to cover the spread. As long as she can win at least three games in each set (losing 6-3), she will cover the 6.5-game spread.\n\nFinal Iga Swiatek-Marketa Vondrousova Prediction & Pick\n\nIga Swiatek will win the match, but will she win in another blowout? Vondrousova is a major champion and a French Open runner-up who lost to Ash Barty in the 2019 Roland Garros final. She can play, and she will probably be able to win at least three games per set.

"Preview: Iga Swiatek vs. Marketa Vondrousova - prediction, head-to-head, tournament so far", "body": "Two reigning Grand Slam champions cross paths with a French Open semi-final berth on the line on Tuesday, when Iga Swiatek and Marketa Vondrousova engage in a mouthwatering quarter-final battle.\n\nThe world number one whitewashed Anastasia Potapova to surge into the last eight, while the current Wimbledon holder ended the magical journey of qualifier Olga Danilovic.\n\nMatch preview\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nOnly 40 minutes had passed by the time that Swiatek wrapped up an emphatic fourth-round success over Potapova, continuing her pursuit of a Roland Garros three-peat in merciless style against a foe whom she had experienced plenty of gruelling contests against as juniors.\n\nFast forward to the weekend's encounter on Court Philippe Chatrier, and Swiatek's triumph could hardly have been more dominant, demolishing her Russian foe 6-0 6-0 and dropping a mere 10 points throughout the shortest match of her WTA career to date.\n\nOnly two unforced errors left the racquet of the four-time major winner, in addition to 13 winners, as she booked her spot in the French Open quarter-finals for the fifth year running, and few can envision any other result than Swiatek conquering the Parisian clay again.\n\nSwiatek took five fewer minutes to see off Potapova than she did against Simona Halep at Roland Garros 2019, and it is now a magnificent 16 wins on the bounce for the big-hitting Pole and April's Stuttgart exit at the hands of Elena Rybakina.\n\nMarie Bouzkova and Leolia Jeanjean have also been sent packing by Swiatek without taking a set off her, although the reigning champion was handed a significant scare by Naomi Osaka in her second-round showdown, offering Vondrousova the tiniest crumb of encouragement.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nLob after lob after lob sailed over the head of Serbian qualifier Danilovic during her showdown against Vondrousova, where the world number 125 adopted a risky but potentially rewarding aggressive approach, although her plucky style ultimately proved to be her downfall.\n\nVondrousova failed to win any of the first three games of their fourth-round battle, but Danilovic aided her recovery efforts with a steady stream of unforced errors, and the fifth seed ran out a 6-4 6-2 victor with one hour and 20 minutes played before offering the valiant qualifier a warm hug at the net.\n\nA third Grand Slam quarter-final from her last four attempts now awaits Vondrousova, who has only ever made it this far once at Roland-Garros before - advancing to the 2019 final and being condemned to the runners-up prize by Ashleigh Barty - before conquering SW19 last year.\n\nBefore turning her thoughts to a Wimbledon title defence, the 24-year-old pits her wits against Swiatek having also dropped just one set at the French Open so far, easing past Rebeka Masarova and Chloe Paquet either side of fighting back from an opening bagel against Katie Volynets.\n\nEither third seed Coco Gauff or eighth seed Ons Jabeur will be bidding to deny the victor of this battle a place in the Roland Garros championship match, which may see two of the 2023 major winners clash racquets, but there is certainly one firm favourite and one unfancied underdog.\n\nTournament so far\n\nIga Swiatek:\n\nFirst round: vs. Leolia Jeanjean 6-1 6-2\n\nSecond round: vs. Naomi Osaka 7-6[1] 1-6 7-5\n\nThird round: vs. Marie Bouzkova 6-4 6-2\n\nRound of 16: vs. Anastasia Potapova 6-0 6-0\n\nMarketa Vondrousova:\n\nFirst round: vs. Rebeka Masarova 6-1 6-3\n\nSecond round: vs. Katie Volynets 0-6 6-1 6-4\n\nThird round: vs. Chloe Paquet 6-1 6-3\n\nRound of 16: vs. Olga Danilovic 6-4 6-2\n\nHead To Head\n\nWTA Finals (2023) - Group stage: Swiatek wins 7-6[3] 6-0\n\nCincinnati Open (2023) - Quarter-finals: Swiatek wins 7-6[3] 6-1\n\nFrench Open (2020) - First round: Swiatek wins 6-1 6-2\n\nSwiatek and Vondrousova will be pictured together at the net for the fourth time at the top level on Tuesday, and surprise surprise, the world number one has come up trumps in each of their previous three battles.\n\nThe pair's first meeting appropriately came in the opening round of the 2020 French Open, where Swiatek dropped just three games en route to victory and her first major crown, although the pair had to wait three years before being reunited on the court.\n\nBoth of their 2023 showdowns at the Cincinnati Open and WTA Finals were fought on hard surfaces, and despite being taken to a first-set tie-breaker on both occasions, Swiatek got the job done in two, as she did in this tournament four years prior.\n\nWe say: Swiatek to win in two sets\n\nCredit where credit is due to Vondrousova for eliminating one of Roland Garros' surprise packages in round four, although Danilovic's frequent mistakes and persistence with coming forward - allowing the Czech to nonchalantly lift the ball over her head - were key factors in her triumph.\n\nThe Wimbledon winner will almost certainly not enjoy the same luxury against a honed-in Swiatek, who has been laser-focused throughout and should book her spot in the semis without too big a struggle.\n\nID:545037:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect8249:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major

Swiatek silenced everybody who doubted her following the three-set thriller. In the fourth round, the World No.1 demolished Anastasia Potapova 6-0, 6-0. While it was expected that Swiatek would smash many records with that win, it isn't the case.\n\nAs impressive as the double bagel was, Iga Swiatek wasn't able to better Steffi Graf's one long-time record. Swiatek took merely 40 minutes to wrap up her encounter against Anastasia Potapova. However, Graf still holds the record for the shortest match at Roland Garros.\n\nBack in 1988, Graf seemed to be in some sort of hurry as she destroyed Natasha Zvereva 6-0, 6-0 in the French Open finals. While the official time on the scoresheet was recorded as 34 minutes, the time spent by both players on the court was merely 32 minutes.\n\nTaking no credit away from Swiatek, a double bagel is an incredibly rare feat. Since 1968, there have been merely 25 occasions (at the French Open) when a player on the WTA Tour has won 6-0, 6-0. Further, over the past seven years, the double bagel has occurred merely twice. Quite impressively, Iga was the winner in both instances - against Anatasia Potapova in 2024 & Wang Xinyu in 2023.\n\nConsidering that Iga has already replicated an outstanding feat from the Roland Garros 2023, the Warsaw native will hope that she can defend her title as well.\n\nIga Swiatek is in the form of her life. After winning the Madrid Open 2024 and the Italian Open 2024, Swiatek has only dropped one set across the first four matches of the French Open 2024. Undoubtedly, she is the clear favorite to win her 4 Grand Slam on clay.\n\nA potential win on June 8 could witness Swiatek become the first female player to achieve the three-peat at the French Open since Justine Henin (2004-2007) and only the third player in the tournament's history to do so.\n\nFollowing the double bagel win, Iga will definitely have a psychological advantage over her next opponent - Marketa Vondrousova. Following a win over the Czech international, potential matchups against Coco Gauff and either Aryna Sabalenka or Elena Rybakina, stand in Iga's way to winning her 5th Grand Slam title.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "advait_jajodia@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Advait Jajodia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steffi_Graf", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steffi Graf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bagel (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Potapova", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anastasia Potapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WTA_number_1_ranked_singles_tennis_players", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of WTA number 1 ranked singles tennis players"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WTA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natasha_Zvereva", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natasha Zvereva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xinyu", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wang Xinyu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justine_Henin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justine Henin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clay_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clay court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Advocacy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Advocacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open_Source", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Open Source", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/e592b32d-untitled-design-2024-06-04t152327.745.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622368", "eventUri": "eng-9622368", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 1834, "textEnd": 1840}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The three-time Roland Garros champion showcased her relentless form, dismantling the fifth-seed Czech with ease.\n\nFrom the outset, Swiatek established her dominance. She broke Vondrousova's serve in the second game, setting the tone for the match. The fourth game turned into a drawn-out battle, with Swiatek dragging it out to finally secure a double-break with a piercing backhand winner.\n\nThe Wimbledon champion Vondrousova, despite her accolades, found herself outmatched, her efforts thwarted at every turn. Swiatek, sporting a purple skirt that matched her vibrant form, closed out the first set in just 28 minutes with a third break, overcoming Vondrousova.\n\nNext up for Swiatek is Coco Gauff, who had earlier staged a superb comeback to beat Ons Jabeur in the quarterfinals. Swiatek, who began the match against Vondrousova with a front-footed approach, was dominant off both flanks, leaving her opponent chasing shadows across the baseline.\n\nHer return game was equally potent, breaking Vondrousova's serve with ease. At 3-0, Swiatek's backhand grazed the line after some brutal forehands, securing her second break of the match.\n\nThe heavy hitting continued as Swiatek wrapped up the first set with a bagel. She carried this momentum into the second set, holding serve comfortably and continuing her devastating groundstrokes.\n\nVondrousova managed to hold serve at 1-1 and even spurned a break point as Swiatek showed a momentary lapse in concentration. However, Swiatek quickly regained her ruthless form, closing out the match just over the hour mark with another forced error from Vondrousova.\n\nSwiatek ended the game with 25 winners, while Vondrousova tallied 18 forced errors. Reflecting on her performance, Swiatek said, \"Honestly, I think everything worked. I feel like I've been serving better than in previous rounds, so that gave me an extra boost of confidence. Overall, I felt like I was playing well, and I could play my game and go with my tactics, and not overthink anything.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Today it was pretty straightforward. I'm happy that I kept my focus because sometimes I felt like the game was really intense, and sometimes the intensity went down a little. I wanted to play my game no matter what was coming back from Marketa, and I felt like I was in the zone today.\"\n\nLooking ahead to her match against Gauff, Swiatek remained pragmatic. \"[I'll prepare for Gauff] the same as any other match. You don't want to change your routines. It's good not to think about this match as something huge but just another match and not put too much baggage on your shoulders. Against Coco, it's not easy. She really likes playing on clay, especially here, so I'll focus on myself and prepare tactically. We'll see.\"", "source": {"uri": "socialnews.xyz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social News XYZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Czech Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bagel (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundstroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Groundstroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forehand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forehand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tennis court"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://boxoffice.socialnews.xyz/get_ians_img.php.jpg?url=French+Open%3A+Iga+Swiatek+dominates+Vondrousova+to+meet+Gauf+in+semis", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622368", "eventUri": "eng-9622368", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

was honoured to be compared to 22-time Grand Slam champion Steffi Graf as the Polish world number one extended her winning run at the French Open to 19 matches on Tuesday.\n\nSwiatek blew past Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova 6-0, 6-2 to advance to the semi-finals and move within two victories of a third consecutive Roland Garros title.\n\nHer record in six visits to Paris now stands at 33-2 and she will be heavily favoured to reach another final, having beaten upcoming opponent Coco Gauff in straight sets in 10 of 11 meetings.\n\nSwiatek is undoubtedly the player to beat as the Pole aims to become only the fourth woman to win four Roland Garros singles titles in the Open era.\n\nOne of those to accomplish the feat alongside Chris Evert and Justine Henin was Graf, a six-time champion in Paris who reigned supreme in the women's game in the late 1980s and for much of the 1990s.\n\nThe German, now 54, was the last player to achieve a calendar Grand Slam, sweeping all four major titles as well as capturing Olympic singles gold in 1988.\n\nSwiatek has inflicted crushing defeats on her past two opponents, hammering Anastasia Potapova 6-0, 6-0 in a performance reminiscent of Graf's 32-minute walloping of Natasha Zvereva in the 1988 Roland Garros final.\n\n\"She's a great champion, and, well, it's just nice that anybody would compare me to her,\" said Swiatek, who at one point won 20 consecutive games stretching across her last-16 and quarter-final ties.\n\n\"I don't know her, but I feel like maybe she was kind of a similar person to me because she also likes to keep her privacy,\" added Swiatek.\n\n\"I also heard from some people on tour that she was also kind of like an introvert, really in the zone and just focusing on tennis and what she wants to do.\"\n\nOminously for her rivals, Swiatek said her game was \"getting better and better\" after Vondrousova fell victim to another of her clay-court masterclasses.\n\nSwiatek reeled off the first seven games against the Czech fifth seed and 2019 French Open runner-up, who conceded she simply had no answers.\n\n\"She's I feel like way better than anyone else on clay, and especially here,\" said Vondrousova.\n\n\"I feel like on the court you have nothing to, I don't know, maybe offer or she's just, you know, she's just too strong here.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news",

when Swiatek claimed her first title in Paris.\n\nAnd it was even more emphatic for the three-time champion this year, dropping just two games as she dispatched her fellow reigning Slam champion 6-0, 6-2 in just 62 minutes.\n\nSwiatek has dropped just eight games since her epic second-round clash against Naomi Osaka - where she saved a match point - and is an overwhelming favourite to win her fifth major.\n\nThe Pole will face third seed Coco Gauff next in a rematch of the 2022 final and 2023 quarter-final and will be looking for an 11th win over the American - having lost to Gauff just once.\n\nAnd victory would be the 41st top-10 win of her career, having picked up a 40th win against world No 6 Vondrousova on Tuesday - aged only 23.\n\nThere are plenty of incredible stats around Swiatek's career, and her top-10 record has to be up there as among the most impressive.\n\nShe has played 55 matches against top-10 players and has won 40 of them, holding a staggering 72.7% win rate against players in that bracket.\n\nHer first top-10 wins came on her way to the first of her four Grand Slam titles at Roland Garros in 2020, beating world No 2 Simona Halep in the fourth round before downing world No 6 Sofia Kenin in the final.\n\nThree more top-10 wins came in 2021 - most famously a 6-0, 6-0 victory over No 9 Karolina Pliskova in the Italian Open final - but her success well and truly kicked off in her dominant 2022 season.\n\nThat season, she won 15 of her 17 matches against top-10 ranked players, including three on her way to the 2022 US Open title - beating Jessica Pegula, Aryna Sabalenka, and Ons Jabeur in her final three matches.\n\nShe also won 13 matches over top-10 players in 2023 and has a staggering 7-1 record against fellow top-10 players so far in 2024.\n\nHer Stuttgart semi-final loss to Elena Rybakina is the one blemish on her record this season, with wins over Rybakina, Gauff, and Sabalenka already on her CV in 2024.\n\nSwiatek will be a heavy favourite in her semi-final clash against Gauff, and could then face world No 2 Sabalenka or world No 4 Rybakina in the final.", "source": {"uri": "tennis365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis365.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oli_dickson_jefford@tennis365.com", "name": "Oli Dickson Jefford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_\u015awi\u0105tek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iga \u015awi\u0105tek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark\u00e9ta_Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Open", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French Open"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon_Championships", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wimbledon Championships"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia_Potapova", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anastasia Potapova"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_Slam\u2013related_tennis_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of Grand Slam\u2013related tennis records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coco_Gauff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coco Gauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Osaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naomi Osaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Kenin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sofia Kenin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryna_Sabalenka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aryna Sabalenka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Pegula", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jessica Pegula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elena_Rybakina", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elena Rybakina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Open_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italian Open (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ons_Jabeur", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ons Jabeur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karol\u00edna_Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simona_Halep", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Simona Halep"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Slam_(tennis)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grand Slam (tennis)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttgart", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Stuttgart"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2me2qg8dfiw8u.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F04140239%2FIga-Swiatek-QF.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9622368", "eventUri": "eng-9622368", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5294117647058822, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Swiatek has consistently outperformed her upcoming opponent, Coco Gauff, winning 10 out of their 11 encounters in straight sets.\n\nAs Swiatek sets her sights on becoming only the fourth woman in the Open era to claim four Roland Garros singles titles, she finds herself in the company of tennis legends Chris Evert, Justine Henin, and Steffi Graf, who achieved this remarkable feat and dominated the women's game during the late 1980s and much of the 1990s.\n\nGraf, now 54 years old, remains the last player to complete a calendar Grand Slam, a feat she accomplished in 1988 by winning all four major titles and securing the Olympic singles gold medal in the same year.\n\nSwiatek's recent performances have been reminiscent of Graf's dominance, particularly her 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of Anastasia Potapova, which echoed Graf's 32-minute demolition of Natasha Zvereva in the 1988 Roland Garros final.\n\n\"She's a great champion, and, well, it's just nice that anybody would compare me to her,\" said Swiatek, who at one point won 20 consecutive games stretching across her last-16 and quarter-final ties.\n\n\"I don't know her, but I feel like maybe she was kind of a similar person to me because she also likes to keep her privacy,\" added Swiatek.\n\n\"I also heard from some people on tour that she was also kind of like an introvert, really in the zone and just focusing on tennis and what she wants to do.\"\n\nSwiatek's performance against Vondrousova was a display of her increasing dominance on clay courts. The Polish player's game continues to improve, which is a daunting prospect for her competitors.\n\n\"Getting better and better,\" Swiatek remarked about her own play following the match. Vondrousova, seeded fifth and a finalist at Roland Garros in 2019, was overwhelmed by Swiatek's masterful performance, unable to find a way to counter her opponent's strategy.\n\n\"She's I feel like way better than anyone else on clay, and especially here,\" said Vondrousova.\n\n\"I feel like on the court you have nothing to, I don't know, maybe offer or she's just, you know, she's just too strong here.\n\n\"I feel like you just go crazy every point.\"\n\n(With AFP inputs)\n\nThe TOI Sports Desk excels in a myriad of roles that capture the essence of live sporting events and deliver compelling content to readers worldwide.

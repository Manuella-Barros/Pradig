A body was found in the hunt for the missing TV presenter and doctor at the weekend after he vanished on Wednesday while on a walk on the island of Symi. His disappearance sparked a major manhunt with mountain rescue teams and divers scouring both the land and surrounding sea near to where he was last seen. But the operation came to a tragic close on Sunday morning when it was confirmed that a body had been found close to local caves known as 'The Abyss'. Greek police confirmed on Sunday that the body was suspected to be that of the missing 67-year-old. He left on Wednesday lunchtime to go on a walk after spending time with wife Dr Clare Bailey at Agios Nikolaos beach on the island. Leaving behind his phone, Michael took only a bottle of water, his wallet and an umbrella in his rucksack. It was his watch, however, that caught the attention of local bar manager Ilias Tsavaris, after it glistened in the sun. Authorities said Michael appeared to have fallen down a 10-metre cliff edge, and was found close to Agia Marina beach on the island. He was spotted by crews from a boat in the water, with the nearby bar called upon to inspect the scene closer. Mr Tsavaris said he had tried to get closer to the scene, before the alarm was raised with police. Symi's mayor Eleftherios Papakalodouk said he had been on the boat at the time, with crews zooming in on the sighting to confirm their suspicions. A statement from the Mayor read: \"During our research, and as we were approaching a cave next to the Agia Marina beach, we were shooting along the coastline with cameras. \"We saw an object next to a fence on the beach and when we zoomed in we realised that it was Michael Mosley's body. He had probably fallen from a short cliff of about 10 metres.\" Police sources on the island reportedly told the BBC they believed that the body - which has still not been identified - had been there for a number of days. Earlier on Sunday morning, it had been confirmed that Greek search and rescue teams had withdrawn their sniffer dog and returned to Athens, reportedly over fears of the impact of the prolonged heat on the animal.", "summary": "Greek authorities confirmed on Sunday that a body had been found in the search for TV presenter and doctor Michael Mosley who vanished on the island of Symi on Wednesday", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/michael-mosleys-body-identified-watch-32992705", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32993247.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Michael-Mosley-missing.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 17:20:38", "author": "Susie Beever,Susie-Beever", "authors": ["Susie Beever", "Susie-Beever"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.225}

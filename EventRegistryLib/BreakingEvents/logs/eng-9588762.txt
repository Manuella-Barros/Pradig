Anglo employs more than 40,000 people in South Africa, where mining companies have been cutting jobs and investment, as platinum especially falls out of favour.\n\nSouth Africa's Public Investment Corporation had earlier said that BHP should consider revising its initial proposal. \"A meaningful revision of the current BHP proposal ... should take into consideration the material risks that current shareholders of both Anglo and its subsidiaries would have to assume over an extended time frame,\" said Abel Sithole, the CEO for PIC, which is Anglo's second-largest shareholder.\n\nAnalysts at JP Morgan last week said BHP would need to boost its offer by around 30% to reflect fair value for Anglo and its prized copper assets in Chile and Peru. Developments such as artificial intelligence and automation, and the energy transition including electric vehicles and renewable energy, have driven up demand prospects for copper cable used to conduct electricity.

BHP struck a more optimistic tone than Anglo, suggesting it sees a path to a deal.\n\nRead More: BHP's $39 Billion Bid for Anglo American Was Years in the Making\n\n\"We have been engaging with Anglo American and its advisors to help mitigate the concerns,\" BHP said. \"We have made progress on these topics over the course of the engagement so far, and we are hopeful that resolution will be reached in the next seven days.\"\n\nThe announcement extends a month of drama that has captivated the mining world, confirming the return to mega M&A by the industry's biggest players after years on the sidelines, while triggering speculation that BHP's rivals could enter the fray with competing bids. Anglo had already twice rebuffed BHP proposals to first break up and then acquire the company, and instead rushed out a radical restructuring plan of its own.\n\nThe news also comes just hours before a regulatory cut-off for BHP to either commit to an offer or walk away for six months under UK takeover rules. Anglo has also agreed to an extension of the deadline to May 29.\n\nRead More: BHP Debates Improved Anglo Bid as Time Runs Out in Takeover Saga\n\nAnglo swung on the news before trading 0.7% lower at \u00a326.68 at 3:41 p.m. London time. They remain 12% below the value of BHP's bid, which valued Anglo at \u00a330.38 based on Tuesday's share prices.\n\n\"The conclusion here appears to be clear - this new proposal was rejected by Anglo on grounds of structure rather than price,\" advisory firm MKP Advisors wrote in a note.\n\nThe thrust of negotiations are now likely to focus on Anglo's South African businesses, which appear to have crystallized as the key point of dispute. BHP has refused to budge. The world's biggest miner is insisting Anglo first exit its investments in Johannesburg-listed Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd., while Anglo repeated its continued objections to the multi-step proposal.\n\n\"It does not address the board's concerns about the structure, which results in significant complexity, execution risks, an extended timeline to completion and consequently has the potential for material value leakage to be disproportionately suffered by Anglo American's shareholders,\" Anglo Chairman Stuart Chambers said.\n\nIf the two sides were to reach a deal, it would probably face close antitrust scrutiny and require several layers of approvals in South Africa, where mining is an important employer and Anglo itself has a long history.\n\nRead More: Anglo's Second-Largest Investor Says BHP Needs to Revise Bid (1)\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, South Africa's state-owned Public Investment Corp., which is Anglo American's second-largest shareholder, issued a statement that BHP's previous offer would require \"meaningful revision.\" Crucially, the PIC also said that BHP should consider the material risks it was asking Anglo shareholders to take.\n\nThe tug-of-war over Anglo's future is also taking place against the backdrop of surging copper prices, driven by a wave of speculative money betting on future shortages that sent London Metal Exchange futures to a record earlier this week.\n\nWhile Anglo's copper assets have long been coveted by rivals, its complicated corporate structure and unusual mix of commodities has largely deterred potential suitors until now.\n\nHowever, the miner has faced a series of major setbacks over the past year as prices for some of its key products plunged, while operational difficulties have forced the company to slash its production targets -- driving down its valuation and leaving the company vulnerable to BHP's approach.\n\nAnglo Chief Executive Officer Duncan Wanblad last week unveiled a dramatic plan to reshape its business by exiting platinum, diamonds and coal and slowing an unpopular fertilizer project, framing the plan as a better alternative to the deal being proposed by BHP.",

This doesn't bode well for things locally today.\n\nBHP advised that on 20 May it submitted an increased and final offer ratio to the Board of Directors of Anglo American.\n\nIt notes that the structure of the revised proposal remains the same as previous proposals and comprises an all-share offer for Anglo American. It will once again be subject to the pro-rata distribution by Anglo American of its entire shareholdings in Anglo American Platinum and Kumba Iron Ore to shareholders immediately before completion of the scheme of arrangement.\n\nUnder the terms of the revised proposal, BHP has offered:\n\nThis final offer ratio represents a total value of GBP31.11 (A$59.64) per Anglo American share or a total consideration of approximately A$74 billion.\n\nIt also represents an improvement on the original offer of 0.7097 BHP shares per Anglo American share, as well as its most recent offer of 0.8132 BHP shares per share.\n\nCommenting on the offer, BHP CEO Mike Henry said:\n\nBHP has put forward a final offer ratio of 0.8860 BHP shares for each Anglo American share. This is a significant increase from our first proposal and would provide Anglo American shareholders with 17.8% of a combined BHP and Anglo American. The revised proposal is underpinned by BHP's disciplined approach to mergers and acquisition and our focus on delivering long term fundamental value.\n\nBHP's revised proposal will offer immediate value for Anglo American shareholders and allow them to benefit from the long-term value generation of the combined group. BHP looks forward to engaging with the Board of Anglo American to explore this unique and compelling opportunity to bring together two highly complementary, world class businesses.\n\nUnfortunately for Mike Henry and his team, this latest offer has been rejected immediately by the copper miner.\n\nAnglo American's chair, Stuart Chambers, revealed that its board believes the company is better off going it alone. He commented:\n\nThe Board is confident in Anglo American's standalone future prospects and believes that Anglo American has set out a clear pathway and timeframe to deliver the acceleration of its strategy to unlock significant and undiluted value for Anglo American's shareholders.\n\nIn addition, Chambers advised that the offer was not expected to deliver sufficient value to shareholders. He adds:\n\nThe Board considered BHP's Latest Proposal carefully, concluded it does not meet expectations of value delivered to Anglo American's shareholders, and has unanimously rejected it. In particular, it does not address the Board's concerns about the structure, which results in significant complexity, execution risks, an extended timeline to completion and consequently has the potential for material value leakage to be disproportionately suffered by Anglo American's shareholders.

BHP's latest offer is 11.3 per cent higher than its second proposal a little more than a week ago, and a 24.8 per cent improvement over its original offer in April.\n\nLondon-based Anglo once again drew attention to BHP's complicated proposal, which is contingent on Anglo spinning off two businesses, its controlling stakes in Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) and Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nAnglo in a release on Wednesday reiterated that it has \"serious concerns with the structure,\" specifically around whether the spinoffs can be executed successfully, and the risk that its shareholders could be punished in the process.\n\nBut Anglo said that is willing to keep talking to BHP, and requested that the \"put up or shut up\" deadline for BHP to make a firm offer be pushed out by a week. The British takeover panel agreed to the request, and BHP now has until 5pm BST on May 29 to make a firm offer for Anglo.\n\nAnglo last week unveiled its own complicated plan that would see it remain as a standalone. Under that plan, Anglo is looking at selling its metallurgical coal, diamonds and nickel businesses, as well as spinning off Amplats.\n\nAnglo over the past year has performed poorly and its share price had fallen steeply, making it vulnerable to a takeover. A major drag on the stock has been an extremely costly construction of a fertilizer mine in Britain.\n\nBHP is primarily interested in Anglo because of its copper business.

This suggests that the target is under shareholder pressure to talk, and the Public Investment Corporation, which holds shares in both, outlined its preferences shortly before the companies released their statements.\n\nAnglo American is ready to talk turkey with BHP, raising the prospect that the biggest mining merger in over a decade may yet come to fruition.\n\nA month of riveting drama in the mining world is set for its next stage, after Anglo said on Wednesday it had rejected BHP's latest offer made on Monday, but extended the Pusu -- merger and acquisitions lingo for \"put up or shut up\" -- deadline by a week.\n\nThis effectively means it's open to talks with the world's biggest mining company.\n\nThe deadline is now 29 May, the day South Africa holds its general elections, so the Pusu could get pushed out again.\n\nThe latest offer would raise the stake of Anglo shareholders to 17.8% in the combined company from 14.8% in the first proposal. This would be an all-share deal, focused squarely on Anglo's coveted copper assets in Latin America.\n\nBut the structure remains the same: Anglo would first need to offload its main South African assets, Anglo American Platinum (Amplats) and Kumba Iron Ore.\n\nSince BHPs initial proposal, Anglo has said it intends to hive off Amplats, along with diamond giant De Beers and its steel-making coal assets.\n\nSo part of BHP's proposed structure is in Anglo's game plan, but the target has said the offer creates a \"complex process... likely to take 18 months or more to complete and carries significant execution and completion risks relating to both value and time.\"\n\nIt must be said on this front that Anglo's disposals will likely take a similar amount of time.\n\n\"BHP's revised proposal will offer immediate value for Anglo American shareholders and allow them to benefit from the long-term value generation of the combined group,\" BHP CEO Mike Henry said in a statement.\n\nHenry also said the new offer ratio was \"final\".\n\nBut it's not set in stone, as BHP is open to Anglo's board recommending a higher bid or BHP upping its offer if a rival steps in with another proposal.\n\nThere have been reports that Glencore is also weighing up a move on Anglo.\n\nPointedly, Anglo's extension of the Pusu suggests its shareholders are applying some pressure.\n\nOne point of contention is the valuation, but that can be worked out.\n\n\"The Final Offer Ratio represents a total value of \u00a331.11 per Anglo American share based on the closing share prices of BHP as at 22 May 2024 and Anglo Platinum and Kumba as at 21 May 2024,\" BHP said.\n\nAnglo maintains the offer values it rather less, based on averages over a longer time frame.\n\n\"On the basis of the 30-day and 90-day volume weighted average share prices up to and including 23 April 2024, the terms of the latest proposal would value Anglo American at \u00a329.91 and \u00a329.67 per Anglo American share, respectively,\" Anglo said.\n\nStepping into the tussle, the Public Investment Corporation (PIC) -- which manages the pensions of South Africa's public servants and holds shares in both companies -- put out a statement shortly before either company had done so.\n\nThe PIC's release was headlined: \"PIC preference on the proposed BHP offer for Anglo American.\"\n\nThe word \"preference\" is revealing and shows that the PIC is open to a deal -- but on its terms. It holds 7.7% in Anglo, making it the second-biggest shareholder in the company.\n\n\"As a shareholder in both entities, the Public Investment Corporation believes offers from BHP should reflect both the embedded value of existing Anglo assets and the future optionality and benefits that BHP can derive, specifically from Anglo's unlisted assets,\" the PIC said.\n\nThe unlisted assets would presumably include De Beers.\n\nRead more in Daily Maverick: Anglo Ditching De Beers Is Hard Blow for Troubled Diamond Market\n\n\"This would require a meaningful revision of the current BHP proposal that should take into consideration the material risks that current shareholders of both Anglo and its subsidiaries would have to assume over an extended time frame,\" Abel Sithole, the PIC's CEO, was quoted as saying.\n\n\"In addition, there has to be future and perpetual participation by South African shareholders in the acquired assets through the JSE,\" Sithole said.\n\n\"Perpetual participation\" points to BEE requirements and the Department of Trade and Industry sticking its oar into these waters in a bid to churn up the froth.\n\nThat's not easy to enforce in a company that has its primary listing elsewhere, but it signals that the South African government knows which way the wind is blowing and wants a deal in line with its interests.\n\nThe PIC statement did not allude to a third offer, and so, while the timing may strike some as curious, there is no indication it was aware that it had been made.\n\nThe next week or so will be mesmerising.\n\nThe fate of an over century-old company -- which has played an outsized role in South Africa's history -- hangs in the balance as citizens weigh up their political options in the most important election since the advent of democracy in 1994.\n\nAnglo American and South Africa's political landscape could both look very different in June.", "source": {"uri": "dailymaverick.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

But the world's biggest miner still must resolve the deal's most intractable obstacle: What to do about South Africa?\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAfter a month of rising tensions, the companies are holding discussions after BHP raised the value of its proposal for a third time on Monday. Anglo has rejected the latest bid, but agreed to extend a deadline for BHP to commit to a binding offer so that talks can continue.\n\nRead More: Anglo Opens Talks With BHP After Rejecting $49 Billion Offer\n\nThe two sides are now closer to each other in their views on valuation for a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. However, the main sticking point for Anglo is BHP's continued insistence that the London-based company must spin off its majority stakes in two South African miners to its own shareholders before the takeover can proceed.\n\nAnglo still views the structure as too complicated, and is particularly concerned about who will cover the cost of any conditions imposed by South Africa's government to approve the multi-step transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.\n\nA successful takeover would represent one of the biggest-ever mining deals and a defining moment for BHP Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry, who has spent years positioning the commodities giant for a return to large-scale M&A. The combined company would be the biggest copper producer -- with about 10% of global mine supply -- just as renewable energy demand is projected to surge in the coming years.\n\nRead More: BHP's $39 Billion Bid for Anglo American Was Years in the Making\n\nBut while the agreement to extend the deadline and continue talks suggests progress, people with knowledge of BHP's position were noticeably more optimistic that a deal is possible than those with insight into Anglo's current views.\n\nAnglo is concerned BHP's demand that it first exit Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. could leave the newly independent Johannesburg-listed companies to carry the cost of any concessions imposed by South Africa, reducing their value and ultimately penalizing the current Anglo investors who would receive the shares in the spin offs. Anglo itself may also face conditions to complete the deal as proposed by BHP.\n\nAnglo wants BHP to cover any such costs -- either up front or in the future -- and those discussions are likely to be a key focus of negotiations over the coming week, the people said.\n\nSpokespeople for BHP and Anglo declined to comment.\n\nFrom the moment BHP's takeover approach first became public, South Africa has loomed front and center of a potential deal. It is home to some of Anglo's biggest operations, employing tens of thousands of employees, and the company has deep political and social ties to the country with a history dating back to its founding in more than a century ago.\n\nBHP by contrast does not have any operations in South Africa, and has at times appeared wrongfooted in its approach, with Henry and other senior officials scrambling to meet shareholders and officials in South Africa days after the news broke. The company also published a belated statement emphasizing that its proposal that Anglo exit the Amplats and Kumba stakes wasn't a reflection on its views about the country as an investment destination.\n\nAnd the deal comes at a particularly awkward time, as South Africa heads toward what is expected to be the tightest election in the country's democratic era -- in fact, the new deadline for BHP to commit to a firm offer has been set for May 29, the same day as the national vote.\n\nThe approvals required for any deal would likely include South Africa's competition authorities, as well as the central bank and finance ministry. Anglo is concerned that authorities could impose conditions that range from job guarantees to social and investment commitments, which could affect the value of the two South African units, and therefore the value of the shares to be received by Anglo's investors in the spinoff.\n\nRead More: BHP CEO Flies to South Africa to Push $39 Billion Takeover\n\nGovernments have a long history of using corporate deals to extract more favorable terms, and South Africa is grappling with widening inequality and one of the world's worst unemployment rate, adding to the pressure to extract concessions.\n\nAnglo's second-biggest shareholder is the South African state-controlled pension fund, which on Wednesday issued a statement raising concerns about the previous BHP offer, just hours before the latest announcements.\n\n\"This would require a meaningful revision of the current BHP proposal that should take into consideration the material risks that current shareholders of both Anglo and its subsidiaries would have to assume over an extended time frame,\" the Public Investment Corp. said at the time.\n\nWhile one senior ruling party politician - Mines Minister Gwede Mantashe - has expressed personal opposition to BHP taking over Anglo, the government has refrained from commenting publicly on the proposed deal, let alone suggesting a preferred outcome.\n\nDealmakers Confident\n\nBut if South Africa's Competition Tribunal does come to scrutinize the spinoff of Amplats and Kumba, the body will evaluate antitrust impacts but also \"public interest\" factors, including how a proposed change of ownership will affect employment levels and historically disadvantaged people.\n\nBHP's dealmakers are confident these obstacles can be addressed, according to the people. The company also sees the issue of price for a takeover as largely settled and does not intend to increase its offer, the people said.\n\nStill, people close to Anglo still see significant gaps in how the scale of the South Africa problem is being perceived by the two sides.\n\nAnglo shares swung after Wednesday's announcements before closing 0.4% higher in London, still trading well below the value of BHP's latest offer.\n\nIn conversations with five of Anglo's top-20 shareholders on Wednesday, most said the latest news suggested the companies are getting closer to an acceptable price for Anglo and an agreement could be in reach. They said, however, that the major stumbling block remains BHP's refusal so far to budge on the deal's structure.\n\nBy undertaking to acquire Kumba - Anglo itself plans to spin off Amplats under its alternative plan - BHP could go a significant way to overcoming resistance to its existing proposal, some of the shareholders said.\n\n\"The companies believe that they're getting closer,\" said James Whiteside, metals and mining corporate research director at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. \"Anglo has probably signposted what needs to happen to get it over the line.\"", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The new offer was pitched at \u00a331.11 per share.\n\nBHP shed 3.8 per cent to \u00a323.38.\n\nFollowing rejection of the second bid earlier this month, Anglo announced it would offload its steelmaking coal, diamond and platinum businesses to focus on critical minerals.\n\nBHP has hoped to create a copper titan by purchasing Anglo.\n\nCopper is essential to the world's transition to renewable energy because it is a vital component for greener technology like energy storage, electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines.\n\nThe price of copper has soared over the past year, reaching a record-high of US$11,104.50 per tonne on Monday.\n\nAnglo American was founded in South Africa in 1917 by the German-born industrialist Ernest Oppenheimer, 15 years after his arrival in the country.\n\nIt is now one of the largest mining companies in the world and is listed on stock exchanges both in London, where it is based, and Johannesburg.\n\nBHP's approach, which proposed Anglo American hiving off its platinum and iron ore production activities in South Africa, caused a stir in the country just before the tightest general election in decades.\n\nSome analysts and opposition politicians viewed such a proposal as an indictment of the decline of South Africa's mining sector. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors":

But the world's biggest miner still must resolve the deal's most intractable obstacle: What to do about South Africa?\n\nAfter a month of rising tensions, the companies are holding discussions after BHP raised the value of its proposal for a third time on Monday. Anglo has rejected the latest bid, but agreed to extend a deadline for BHP to commit to a binding offer so that talks can continue.\n\nRead More: Anglo Opens Talks With BHP After Rejecting $49 Billion Offer\n\nThe two sides are now closer to each other in their views on valuation for a deal, according to people familiar with the matter. However, the main sticking point for Anglo is BHP's continued insistence that the London-based company must spin off its majority stakes in two South African miners to its own shareholders before the takeover can proceed.\n\nAnglo still views the structure as too complicated, and is particularly concerned about who will cover the cost of any conditions imposed by South Africa's government to approve the multi-step transaction, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information.\n\nA successful takeover would represent one of the biggest-ever mining deals and a defining moment for BHP Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry, who has spent years positioning the commodities giant for a return to large-scale M&A. The combined company would be the biggest copper producer -- with about 10% of global mine supply -- just as renewable energy demand is projected to surge in the coming years.\n\nRead More: BHP's $39 Billion Bid for Anglo American Was Years in the Making\n\nBut while the agreement to extend the deadline and continue talks suggests progress, people with knowledge of BHP's position were noticeably more optimistic that a deal is possible than those with insight into Anglo's current views.\n\nAnglo is concerned BHP's demand that it first exit Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. could leave the newly independent Johannesburg-listed companies to carry the cost of any concessions imposed by South Africa, reducing their value and ultimately penalizing the current Anglo investors who would receive the shares in the spin offs. Anglo itself may also face conditions to complete the deal as proposed by BHP.\n\nAnglo wants BHP to cover any such costs -- either up front or in the future -- and those discussions are likely to be a key focus of negotiations over the coming week, the people said.\n\nSpokespeople for BHP and Anglo declined to comment.\n\nFrom the moment BHP's takeover approach first became public, South Africa has loomed front and center of a potential deal. It is home to some of Anglo's biggest operations, employing tens of thousands of employees, and the company has deep political and social ties to the country with a history dating back to its founding in more than a century ago.\n\nBHP by contrast does not have any operations in South Africa, and has at times appeared wrongfooted in its approach, with Henry and other senior officials scrambling to meet shareholders and officials in South Africa days after the news broke. The company also published a belated statement emphasizing that its proposal that Anglo exit the Amplats and Kumba stakes wasn't a reflection on its views about the country as an investment destination.\n\nAnd the deal comes at a particularly awkward time, as South Africa heads toward what is expected to be the tightest election in the country's democratic era -- in fact, the new deadline for BHP to commit to a firm offer has been set for May 29, the same day as the national vote.\n\nThe approvals required for any deal would likely include South Africa's competition authorities, as well as the central bank and finance ministry. Anglo is concerned that authorities could impose conditions that range from job guarantees to social and investment commitments, which could affect the value of the two South African units, and therefore the value of the shares to be received by Anglo's investors in the spinoff.\n\nRead More: BHP CEO Flies to South Africa to Push $39 Billion Takeover\n\nGovernments have a long history of using corporate deals to extract more favorable terms, and South Africa is grappling with widening inequality and one of the world's worst unemployment rate, adding to the pressure to extract concessions.\n\nAnglo's second-biggest shareholder is the South African state-controlled pension fund, which on Wednesday issued a statement raising concerns about the previous BHP offer, just hours before the latest announcements.\n\n\"This would require a meaningful revision of the current BHP proposal that should take into consideration the material risks that current shareholders of both Anglo and its subsidiaries would have to assume over an extended time frame,\" the Public Investment Corp. said at the time.\n\nWhile one senior ruling party politician - Mines Minister Gwede Mantashe - has expressed personal opposition to BHP taking over Anglo, the government has refrained from commenting publicly on the proposed deal, let alone suggesting a preferred outcome.\n\nDealmakers Confident\n\nBut if South Africa's Competition Tribunal does come to scrutinize the spinoff of Amplats and Kumba, the body will evaluate antitrust impacts but also \"public interest\" factors, including how a proposed change of ownership will affect employment levels and historically disadvantaged people.\n\nBHP's dealmakers are confident these obstacles can be addressed, according to the people. The company also sees the issue of price for a takeover as largely settled and does not intend to increase its offer, the people said.\n\nStill, people close to Anglo still see significant gaps in how the scale of the South Africa problem is being perceived by the two sides.\n\nAnglo shares swung after Wednesday's announcements before closing 0.4% higher in London, still trading well below the value of BHP's latest offer.\n\nIn conversations with five of Anglo's top-20 shareholders on Wednesday, most said the latest news suggested the companies are getting closer to an acceptable price for Anglo and an agreement could be in reach. They said, however, that the major stumbling block remains BHP's refusal so far to budge on the deal's structure.\n\nBy undertaking to acquire Kumba - Anglo itself plans to spin off Amplats under its alternative plan - BHP could go a significant way to overcoming resistance to its existing proposal, some of the shareholders said.\n\n\"The companies believe that they're getting closer,\" said James Whiteside, metals and mining corporate research director at Wood Mackenzie, a consultancy. \"Anglo has probably signposted what needs to happen to get it over the line.\"", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BHP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mergers_and_acquisitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mergers and acquisitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumba_Iron_Ore", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kumba Iron Ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_Platinum", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American Platinum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_spin-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporate spin-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwede_Mantashe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gwede Mantashe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competition law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2076286!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/mike-henry.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9588762", "eventUri": "eng-9588762", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 3645, "textEnd": 3651}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

He added that it \"should take into consideration the material risks that current shareholders of both Anglo and its subsidiaries would have to assume over an extended timeframe\".\n\nThe intervention by the PIC, which holds 7.4 per cent of Anglo and about 0.9 per cent of BHP, according to Bloomberg data, comes as the clock ticks down to a 5pm deadline for BHP to declare a formal offer for Anglo or drop its takeover approach.\n\nBHP's takeover attempt is hanging by a thread after a furious political backlash in South Africa, the Australian group's insistence on a controversial deal structure, and Anglo's own strategic pivot to break itself up and focus on just copper and iron ore.\n\nAnglo has rebuffed two takeover proposals from BHP, with the most recent proposal valuing it at \u00a327.53 per share. The value of the all-share deal has risen closer towards \u00a330 per share but the reason for that has primarily been an increase in BHP's share price as investors bet that the deal will not happen.\n\nAnglo's shares dropped 1 per cent in London trading on Wednesday to \u00a326.83.\n\nUnder BHP's proposals, Anglo would need to spin off its South African platinum and iron ore units as part of the agreement -- which has led to the deal being perceived as a vote of no confidence in the country.\n\nTo date, the PIC has equivocated over its preferences but the last-minute intervention clarifies what BHP would need to do to win its support.\n\nSithole added that \"there has to be future and perpetual participation by South African shareholders in the acquired assets\" through the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\n\nThe PIC said that it also recognised the \"positive impact\" of Anglo on the economy of South Africa, where the company was founded more than a century ago, and warned that this \"should not be diminished\" as a result of BHP's proposed offer.\n\nAnalysts say that going hostile has never really been a tenable option for BHP under the proposed deal structure because it would need the co-operation of the Anglo board to execute the demergers of Amplats and Kumba Iron Ore, the two South African units that BHP does not want.\n\nThe PIC said that it \"will continue to engage both companies\".", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP", "type": "org",

The move underscores concerns over execution risks and value leakage, while demands for copper driven by AI and renewable energy remain high.\n\nAnglo American on Wednesday rejected a third takeover proposal from BHP Group that valued the company at 38.6 billion pounds ($49.18 billion), but agreed to a one-week extension for its rival to table a binding offer. The move marks the third unsuccessful offer in a month from BHP, the world's biggest listed mining group, as Anglo works on a radical plan to divest its less profitable coal, nickel, diamond and platinum businesses.\n\nThe 29.34 pounds per share approach, based on undisturbed share prices at market close on April 23 and raised from an initial 25.08 pounds, is still conditional on Anglo un-bundling its platinum and iron ore assets in South Africa, the country where it was founded and has deep roots, employing more than 40,000 people. Anglo reiterated that this condition carries significant execution and completion risks.\n\nBHP's proposal \"does not address the Board's concerns about the structure, which results in significant complexity, execution risks, an extended timeline to completion,\" Anglo chairman Stuart Chambers said in a statement. \"(It) consequently has the potential for material value leakage to be disproportionately suffered by Anglo American's shareholders,\" he added.\n\nAnglo's share price reversed earlier losses at 27.15 pounds, up 1% by 1344 GMT. BHP said in a separate statement that it will not increase the percentage of its shares it is offering Anglo's shareholders as part of the deal, unless a third party makes a competing offer.\n\nAnalysts at JP Morgan\n\nlast week said BHP would need to boost its offer by around 30% to reflect fair value for Anglo and its prized copper assets in Chile and Peru.

No longer is the Anglo board focused on the value of BHP's bid, but instead its concerns revolve around whether or not BHP is asking Anglo shareholders to take on too much risk in completing those two South African spin-offs before the takeover.\n\nThe BHP view is that Anglo has this very wrong, and the risks associated with the demergers are small to non-existent. South African regulators will demand certain guarantees - probably around employment, possibly around funding for social issues - but BHP does not see major impediments to the deal.\n\nSo now Henry now has a week to educate, explain and convince the Anglo board and Anglo shareholders that BHP has done its homework, studied previous similar deals and run through the scenario planning.\n\nIt's fair to say a frisson of confidence was running through the BHP camp on Wednesday night, and why not - if there was no chance the Anglo board could be swayed, then it wouldn't have left the door open for further talks.\n\nBut for BHP investors, there will be obvious concerns as to whether Henry's has kept his prized discipline by bidding against himself for a second time.\n\nThe logic behind BHP's bid always revolved around two ideas. First, while many of Anglo's assets were rubbish, its copper assets and its Queensland coal mines, which sit next door to BHP's own, were highly attractive. And second, Anglo was under real pressure from its frustrated shareholders, and could be snapped up for a relative bargain.\n\nClearly, the attraction of Anglo's copper assets, particularly its brand-new copper Quellaveco mine, in Peru, has not diminished. Indeed, given the impressive rise in the copper prices, those assets look better than ever.\n\nBut having increased its original bid by 24 per cent to \u00a331.11, is Henry still displaying discipline?\n\nThe BHP camp believes it is. While it cannot talk publicly about the synergies it expects to extract from this deal under British takeover law, it remains confident they still justify this higher price. The fact BHP continues to use its scrip, and has not introduced a cash component to the bid, should also assuage the concerns of investors.\n\nKey BHP investors, including the Australian Foundation Investment Company were prepared to back a bump in BHP's bid if it could help secure those prized copper assets.\n\nAnd given BHP launched its bid with Anglo shares still under pressure following its shock announcement in December that it would curtail production in several commodities in order to preserve cash, BHP shareholders can take comfort that this is not one of the top-of-the-cycle deals miners were infamous for two decades ago.\n\nBut for all that, this does remain a deal laced with execution risk, because it remains a deal where BHP is buying a lot of stuff it doesn't want - those South African platinum and iron ore businesses, as well as Anglo's manganese, diamonds, nickel and potash businesses - to get at the few assets it wants to keep.\n\nYes, BHP has pulled off the demergers of South32 and its petroleum business (which was merged with Woodside) in recent years. But the demergers of the Anglo's South African businesses will require a raft of approvals inside South Africa - which is going to the polls on May 29, by the way - and from regulators around the world.\n\nThen, offloading the manganese, diamonds, nickel and Woodsmith potash businesses without destroying value may well take some time; as BHP knows from selling unwanted coal mines in recent years,\n\nAnd Henry will still need to integrate the businesses he does want. Anglo's Queensland coal mines sit close to BHP's assets, so this task would have been relatively easy. But integrating Anglo's copper mines - a mix of very old, and very new assets - would come with a level of risk.\n\nHenry has preached simplification and laser-like, unrelenting focus since he took the top job in early 2020, and he's largely delivered. But buying Anglo American will instantly make BHP more complex, and introduce a level of distraction the company has avoided for several years.\n\nAre Anglo's copper and coal assets worth it?

As set out in the Extension Announcement, the Board of Anglo American requested an extension of the deadline under Rule 2.6(c) of the UK Code with the consent of the UK Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the Takeover Panel).\n\nBHP confirms that on 20 May 2024 it submitted an increased and final offer ratio to the Board of Directors of Anglo American as part of its proposal for a potential combination with Anglo American to be effected by way of a scheme of arrangement. In putting forward the Final Offer Ratio (as defined below), BHP has been guided by its capital allocation framework and its view of the fundamental value of Anglo American and BHP.\n\nThe revised proposal follows BHP's initial proposal which was submitted to the Board of Anglo on 16 April 2024 (Initial Proposal) and BHP's second proposal which was submitted to the Board of Anglo on 7 May 2024 (Second Proposal).\n\nThe transaction structure of the revised proposal remains the same as BHP's previous proposals and comprises an all-share offer for Anglo American subject to the pro-rata distribution by Anglo American of its entire shareholdings in Anglo American Platinum Ltd (Anglo Platinum) and Kumba Iron Ore Ltd (Kumba) to Anglo American shareholders immediately before completion of the scheme of arrangement. Since the submission of the revised proposal, we have been engaging with Anglo American and its advisors to help mitigate the concerns associated with the implementation of this structure that led to the rejection of the revised proposal. We have made progress on these topics over the course of the engagement so far, and we are hopeful that resolution will be reached in the next seven days.\n\nUnder the extended deadline, BHP must either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Anglo American in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the UK Code or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for Anglo American, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the UK Code applies, by no later than 5.00 p.m. (BST) on 29 May 2024 (the Revised Deadline). The Revised Deadline can be extended with the consent of the Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the UK Code.\n\nStructure of the proposal\n\nUnder the terms of the revised proposal, ordinary shareholders of Anglo American would receive:\n\nThe Final Offer Ratio represents a total value of \u00a331.11 per Anglo American share based on the closing share prices of BHP as at 22 May 2024 and Anglo Platinum and Kumba as at 21 May 2024.\n\nThe combined group would have a leading portfolio of large, low-cost, long-life Tier 1 assets focused on iron ore and metallurgical coal and future facing commodities, including potash and copper. Anglo American's other high quality businesses, including its diamond business, would be subject to a strategic review post completion.\n\nBHP is committed to a combination that leverages the best of both BHP and Anglo American and intends to offer Anglo American up to two positions on the Board of the combined entity.\n\nBHP will work closely and constructively with competition regulators and provide the information they need to assess the potential transaction. BHP is confident that it can obtain all required regulatory approvals and consummate a transaction that benefits customers globally.\n\nThe revised proposal is non-binding and subject to customary conditions including completion of due diligence to the satisfaction of BHP. Anglo American has been offered reciprocal due diligence on BHP.\n\nMike Henry, BHP Chief Executive Officer said:\n\n\"BHP has put forward a final offer ratio of 0.8860 BHP shares for each Anglo American share. This is a significant increase from our first proposal and would provide Anglo American shareholders with 17.8% of a combined BHP and Anglo American.\n\nThe revised proposal is underpinned by BHP's disciplined approach to mergers and acquisition and our focus on delivering long term fundamental value.\n\nBHP's revised proposal will offer immediate value for Anglo American shareholders and allow them to benefit from the long-term value generation of the combined group.\n\nBHP looks forward to engaging with the Board of Anglo American to explore this unique and compelling opportunity to bring together two highly complementary, world class businesses.\"\n\nThe revised proposal represents an increase in the spot aggregate \u00a3 value per Anglo American ordinary share over the Second Proposal (as announced on 13 May 2024) of 11.3%. The terms of the revised proposal represent an increase over the Initial Proposal:\n\nThe increase in the Final Offer Ratio reflects additional value from Anglo American's restructuring proposal and cost plans. BHP believes that the Final Offer Ratio represents a compelling opportunity for long term fundamental value-creation for both Anglo American and BHP shareholders.\n\nUK Takeover Code\n\nPursuant to Rule 2.5 of the Code, BHP reserves the right:\n\nIf Anglo American announces, declares, makes, or pays any dividend or any other distribution or return of value to shareholders, Note 4 on Rule 2.5 of the Code applies.\n\nThis announcement does not amount to a firm intention to make an offer and there can be no certainty that an offer will be made. There is no certainty that any form of agreement or transaction will be reached or concluded.\n\nThis announcement is being made by BHP without prior agreement or approval of Anglo American.\n\n1. The Final Offer Ratio will not be increased, except that BHP reserves the right to increase and/or otherwise improve the Final Offer Ratio if (i) there is an announcement on or after the date of this announcement of an offer or possible offer (including a partial offer) for Anglo American by a third party offeror(s) or potential offeror(s) (whether identified or not), (ii) the Board of Anglo American announces that it recommends or is minded to recommend an offer on better terms than the Final Offer Ratio or (iii) the Takeover Panel otherwise provides its consent.\n\n2. This release was made outside of the hours of operation of the ASX markets announcement office.\n\n3. Anglo American's unlisted assets comprises the entirety of the value implied for Anglo American's assets and liabilities excluding its shareholdings in Anglo Platinum and Kumba based on Anglo American's closing price less the closing prices of Anglo Platinum and Kumba on 23 April 2024, being the last trading day prior to the press speculation about the Initial Proposal.\n\n4. Net asset value is based upon a median of the six brokers which disclose SOTP, including Anglo Platinum and Kumba, alongside latest reported Anglo Platinum and Kumba net cash balances as of 31 December 2023.\n\n5. Based on 0.8860 BHP shares for each ordinary share. The number of fully diluted Anglo American shares assumed excludes shares held by Tarl Investment Holdings Limited, Epoch Investment Holdings Limited, and Epoch Two Investment Holdings. These shares total 112,300,129 as per the Rule 2.9 announcement by Anglo American dated 25 April 2024.\n\n6. Based on spot FX rates as at 21 May 2024 (AUD:GBP 0.5243; ZAR:GBP 0.0435).\n\nAuthorised for release by Stefanie Wilkinson, Group Company Secretary.\n\nImportant Notices\n\nBarclays Bank PLC, acting through its Investment Bank (Barclays), which is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, is acting exclusively for BHP and no one else in connection with the subject matter of this announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than BHP for providing the protections afforded to clients of Barclays nor for providing advice in relation to the subject matter of this announcement.\n\nUBS AG London Branch is authorised and regulated by the Financial Market Supervisory Authority in Switzerland.

'Multiple engagements with the BHP team have not yet been able to resolve the concerns on these issues,' Chambers said.\n\n'However, the board is willing to continue to engage with BHP and its advisers on this topic,' he added.\n\nBHP said that it has 'made progress' on the issue and was 'hopeful that a resolution will be reached in the next seven days'.\n\nChief executive Mike Henry said: 'BHP looks forward to engaging with the board of Anglo American to explore this unique and compelling opportunity to bring together two highly complementary, world-class businesses.'\n\nAnglo has itself unveiled plans to spin off the Johannesburg-listed platinum unit but wants to hold on to its Kumba iron ore business.\n\nUnder proposals for Anglo to remain a stand-alone company, it would also sell diamond arm De Beers and its steel-making, coal and nickel businesses.\n\nMeanwhile, the future of its Woodsmith mine in North Yorkshire is at risk.\n\nDIY INVESTING PLATFORMS Easy investing Stocks & shares Isa \u00a31.50 fund dealing 0.25% fee on fund holdings Investment ideas Free fund dealing Free fund dealing 0.45% account fee capped for shares Flat-fee investing No fees From \u00a34.99 a month Trade shares and funds for \u00a33.99 Social investing Social investing Share investing 30+ million global community No account fee Investment account Free share dealing Free fractional share* Affiliate links: If you take out a product This is Money may earn a commission.

If chief executive officer Mike Henry instead decided against, he will have to stay away for at least six months.\n\nThe catch is that Anglo's chief executive officer Duncan Wanblad has so far refused talks with BHP, criticising a plan the target company feels is too complex and undervalues its stock.\n\nBHP's discussions over the past few days have focused on whether it can table an offer attractive enough to get Anglo's shareholders to push the company toward talks, people familiar with the matter said at the weekend.\n\nDitching the proposal remained a strong possibility, the people said, with BHP wary of bidding against itself in a vacuum.\n\nAt current prices, the latest informal approach from BHP valued Anglo at roughly \u00a329.49 a share.

As the summit ended on Wednesday, the mining world was still waiting for white smoke from London that would signify whether BHP has made a final bid for Anglo American that will drag the target's board to the negotiating table.\n\nWhile the fate of the critical minerals sector dominated the summit's agenda, there was no shortage of speculation about the deal on the sidelines of the event.\n\nThe networks of former Anglo executives were suggesting there could be a last-minute plot twist. BHP shareholders in the room seemed broadly supportive. Strange rumours of Saudi interest in Anglo's copper assets were even doing the rounds.\n\nBut from London and BHP headquarters in Melbourne, there was radio silence as the Financial Review's deadline approached.\n\nBen Cleary, portfolio manager for Tribeca's global natural resources strategy and Anglo shareholder, wouldn't be drawn on whether BHP would bid again. But did tell a story that neatly illustrates why BHP is so interested in Anglo - and why more big-ticket deals are coming.\n\nIt's no secret that this deal is all about copper. Global demand and prices are surging, and BHP wants to use Anglo's assets to boost its already world-leading reserves.\n\nBut as Cleary explained, about half of Anglo's current copper production comes from its Quellaveco mine, which is located in the Moquegua region of Peru.\n\nAnglo bought that asset in 1992, but it did not start production until last year. \"That was a 30-year journey and it's not dissimilar to any of the large mines that are in production at the moment, and there is just no pipeline for these big mines.\"\n\nThe extraordinarily long gestation periods for new mines, and the ever-increasing costs of building them - Cleary says BHP's giant Escondida copper mine in Chile would cost about $25 billion to build today - means there is a clear preference for miners to buy assets rather than build them.\n\nIt's why Cleary believes we are about to enter the era of the \"disappearing resources sector\" where big deals become more common - and big multiples will be required to close them.\n\n\"I think you're going to see more deals because that fits into the buy-over-build strategy,\" Cleary days.\n\nBrett Beatty, the Australian managing director of US private equity group Resource Capital Funds, similarly expects more deals, with the copper sector likely to be a focus; his firm recently sold a copper mine in Botswana, and bought a new one in Chile.\n\nWhen the Botswana deal was originally struck, Beatty says there were even critics inside the fund that believed Resource Capital had overpaid. But the transaction turned out well, and the hunt for more copper exposure continues.\n\n\"It's a market where you have to take risks and you'll be rewarded for it,\" he says. \"But if you sit on the sidelines and just wait, you'll miss out.\"\n\nOf course, buying mines rather than building them does nothing to increase production capacity in a commodity. Cleary expects the supply deficits in the copper sector will worsen, pushing up prices.\n\nThat will make assets more expensive, but it should also underpin juicy returns for investors. \"We track about eight different investment classes, and in the last decade, natural resources was the worst performing. So far this decade, and we're only three-and-a-bit years in, it's at number one,\" Beatty says.\n\nCleary believes the mining giants can walk the fine line between doing deals and remaining disciplined on capital returns; this reflects the fact new greenfield mines are so expensive to build that buying a mine will make more economic sense.\n\nBeatty isn't so sure. He expects we'll eventually see some of the craziness from the good old days in mining, when big deals with big price tags regularly ended in big disappointments for investors.\n\nBHP, of course, has had its fair share of those moments in the past.

Unlike Anglo, BHP wants the coal mines, which hold strong synergies with the projects in its 50% owned BMA business in Queensland's Bowen Basin.\n\nThe businesses Anglo wants to keep -- coal and iron ore -- accounted for 72% (US$7.2b) of its earnings in 2023. Despite tailing off on lower prices and higher costs, its coal division remained a strong contributor at US$1.32bn.\n\nThe real question is whether BHP can justify a higher price than its already offered, one that will bring Anglo's board to the table.\n\nIts initial \u00a325.08 a share bid and \u00a327.53/sh follow up couldn't get Anglo to open the books, with many analysts expecting \u00a330/sh or higher would be required, though given the largely scrip nature of the deal BHP's offer is closer to that mark than it was after a recent rise in its share price to three month highs.\n\nAnglo shares have been largely unchanged in the past five days, currently fetching \u00a326.87.\n\nBack in Oz and a far smaller copper mine was in focus today as AIC Mines (ASX:A1M) approved the development of the Jericho project adjacent to its Eloise project.\n\nA 3km underground drive will be dug from Eloise at 125m below surface, taking two years to hit development ore in June 2026.\n\nThe project will transform AIC from a ~12,500tpa producer to ~20,000tpa, incorporating assets picked up in its takeover of Demetallica.\n\nThe drive will also double as an exploration drive to enable resource definition drilling of the Swagman discovery halfway between the two orebodies.\n\n\"The Eloise to Jericho link drive will have many long-term benefits - access will be\n\nconsiderably easier to maintain during the wet season and also allows rapid drilling\n\nand development of any new discoveries along the 3 kilometres of prospective strike,\" AIC boss Aaron Colleran said.\n\n\"Importantly it can be commenced now with equipment and capacity that we already have at Eloise.\"\n\nThe whole project is expected to cost $50m, including $35m for underground development and $15m for ventilation, with another $60m required to expand the Eloise processing plant.\n\nThat is expected to take place over three years, with costs weighted to FY26 and FY27.\n\nAIC entered a trading halt today to raise $57.2m, in an institutional placement priced at 52c per share. That's an 11.9% discount to its May 21 price of 59c, with AIC to have ~$83m in the bank once the placement is complete.\n\nDebt funding will likely be used to fund the Eloise plant expansion.\n\nElsewhere in the market, aluminium prices surged after Rio announced force majeure at its Queensland alumina operations due to gas supply problems.", "source": {"uri":

Under this deal it could be sold off for parts from someone else's company.\"\n\nAfter Anglo American revealed its break-up plan last week, South Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC) said it was considering whether to back the move and stressed the \"mining sector remains a critical part of the South African economy\".\n\nThe break-up plans have also been backed by top investor Legal & General Investment Management, which owns a 1.8 per cent stake in the firm.\n\nNick Stansbury, head of climate solutions at Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM), said the plan outlined by the London-listed miner was \"a radical but attractive strategy to create value for long-term investors\".\n\nLGIM owns 1.8 per cent of Anglo American as well as 0.8 per cent of BHP.\n\nMajor shareholders in Anglo American are reportedly open to accepting a simpler takeover bid from its bigger rival BHP, however.\n\nTop-ten Anglo American investor Ninety One, which holds a two per cent stake in the \u00a336bn firm, said today the turnaround plans could simplify the business and make it a more tempting asset for a number of industry buyers int he future.\n\n\"The plan today creates a longer term way of shrinking and right-sizing the Anglo portfolio, which means it might be interesting for a lot of different mining houses in 12 months time or 18 months time,\" Dawid Heyl, a portfolio manager at Ninety One, told City A.M.\n\n\"There could be other bidders if it's a smaller, more digestible entity.\"", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors":

Rio the same. In terms of their portfolio skew they are still very heavily weighted to iron ore ... you are going to see more deals,\" he said, speaking at the AFR Mining Summit in Perth.\n\nAnglo has twice rejected overtures by BHP, whose deadline to make a third offer expires later on Wednesday. Instead, Anglo has pledged to break up its company to lower costs.\n\nWhether Anglo's management decide to engage with BHP on Tuesday, investors expect more interest in the sector as copper prices, which hit a record above $11,000 a tonne on Monday, climb and encourage new projects.\n\nRising prices will only make competition for copper assets more intense, said Brett Beatty, partner and managing director Australia, of private equity company Resource Capital Funds.\n\nBeatty said he had faced internal questions over whether RCF had overpaid for the 11.9% stake in Botswana's Khoemecau copper mine that it bought for $70 million in 2019.\n\nThat stake was sold when China's MMG bought the mine for $1.88 billion six months ago, making it worth some $224 million, roughly a two-fold return.\n\n\"It's a market where you have to take risk and you'll be rewarded for it, but if you sit on the sidelines you're going to miss out,\" he said.\n\nGiven that lithium prices have begun to recover from rock bottom lows, for companies with the funding, now is a good time to buy, said Joshua Thurlow, head of lithium at Australian diversified miner Mineral Resources.\n\n\"M&A's on people's minds. It's at that point in the cycle. If you can be counter cyclical ... you could argue this is a good time to do it,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"But also sometimes it takes a lot of gusto and a major balance sheet strengthening process to be able to do it,\" he added.\n\nMinRes embarked on an acquisition spree of significant stakes in Australian lithium developers last year.\n\n\"As we continue to look around the goldfield and more prospective areas we will continue to make deals if and when possible,\" he added.\n\nBeyond copper and lithium, there is even interest in unloved nickel whose prices have been hit by a surge in Indonesian supply.\n\nWyloo Metals will in coming weeks put its Western Australian nickel operations on care and maintenance.\n\n\"For us we are trying to see beyond the next 6-12 months to the next 10-15 years,\" CEO Luca Giacovazzi said.\n\n\"We are always acquisitive and we are always looking for a longer term opportunity ... As a family office that is really chasing assets that produce yield, it's an interesting time for us to look at opportunities in the market.\"\n\n(Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Kim

On the basis of the 30-day and 90-day volume weighted average share prices up to and including 23 April 2024, the terms of the Latest Proposal would value Anglo American at \u00a329.91 and \u00a329.67 per Anglo American share, respectively.\n\nThe Latest Proposal includes the same highly complex structure as the proposals previously rejected on 26 April 2024 and 13 May 2024. This involves an all-share offer for Anglo American by BHP, with a requirement for Anglo American to complete two separate demergers of its entire shareholdings in Anglo American Platinum Limited and Kumba Iron Ore Limited to Anglo American's shareholders. The all-share offer and required demergers would be inter-conditional.\n\nThe Board and its advisers have engaged with BHP and its advisers on multiple occasions with a particular focus on the proposed structure and associated risks. The Board continues to believe that there are serious concerns with the structure given that it is likely to result in material completion risk and value impact that disproportionately falls on Anglo American's shareholders.\n\nThe requirement to pursue two contemporaneous demergers of publicly listed companies alongside a takeover and the inter-conditional nature of the three transactions is unprecedented, and as a result of a takeover would result in additional material approvals and conditions, particularly in South Africa. BHP's Latest Proposal is therefore in clear contrast to Anglo American's simpler standalone plan to accelerate value delivery announced on 14 May 2024 and its proposal to demerge Anglo American Platinum Limited - a single demerger that Anglo American has a proven track record in delivering.\n\nThe complex process proposed by BHP is likely to take 18 months or more to complete and carries significant execution and completion risks relating to both value and time. The key elements of Anglo American's standalone plan to accelerate value delivery are expected to be substantively complete by that stage. The approvals required in relation to BHP's Latest Proposal will also likely result in conditions being imposed that disproportionately impact Anglo American Platinum Limited and Kumba Iron Ore Limited and, therefore, Anglo American's shareholders.\n\nIn addition, the Board has also considered detailed feedback from its extensive engagement with Anglo American's shareholders and stakeholders since the release of Anglo American's accelerated plans for delivery of its standalone strategy on 14 May 2024, continuing its engagement with its shareholders since the approach from BHP became public on 24 April 2024.\n\nThe Board is confident in Anglo American's standalone future prospects and believes that Anglo American has set out a clear pathway to deliver the acceleration of its strategy detailed on 14 May 2024, that is expected to unlock significant and undiluted value for Anglo American's shareholders.\n\nTaking the above considerations into account, the Board of Anglo American has unanimously rejected the Latest Proposal.\n\nIn order to allow for further engagement with BHP on the mitigation of risks and value impact on Anglo American's shareholders that are inherent in its Latest Proposal, Anglo American announces that, in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code, the Board has requested, and the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Panel\") has consented to, an extension to the date by which BHP is required either to announce a firm intention to make an offer for Anglo American in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Code or to announce that it does not intend to make an offer, in which case the announcement will be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Code applies. Such announcement must now be made by not later than 5.00 p.m. on 29 May 2024. This deadline will only be extended with the consent of the Panel in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Code.\n\nStuart Chambers, Chairman of Anglo American, commented:\n\n\"The Board is confident in Anglo American's standalone future prospects and believes that Anglo American has set out a clear pathway and timeframe to deliver the acceleration of its strategy to unlock significant and undiluted value for Anglo American's shareholders. The Board considered BHP's Latest Proposal carefully, concluded it does not meet expectations of value delivered to Anglo American's shareholders, and has unanimously rejected it. In particular, it does not address the Board's concerns about the structure, which results in significant complexity, execution risks, an extended timeline to completion and consequently has the potential for material value leakage to be disproportionately suffered by Anglo American's shareholders. Multiple engagements with the BHP team have not yet been able to resolve the concerns on these issues.\n\n\"However, the Board is willing to continue to engage with BHP and its advisers on this topic and has therefore requested a one week extension to the PUSU deadline which has been consented to by the Panel.\"\n\nThere can be no certainty that any firm offer will be made and, save as set out in BHP's announcement dated 13 May 2024 (and subject to the reservations set out therein), there can be no certainty as to the terms on which an offer may be made.\n\nThis announcement is being made without the agreement or approval of BHP.\n\nThe person responsible for this announcement is Richard Price, Legal & Corporate Affairs Director (Company Secretary), Anglo American plc.\n\n1. The total value of the Latest Proposal is based on share prices of BHP, Anglo American Platinum Limited and Kumba Iron Ore Limited as at market close on 23 April 2024, and GBP/AUD and GBP/ZAR exchange rates of 1.9190 and 23.7971, respectively as at 23 April 2024.\n\n2. Volume weighted average prices are derived from Bloomberg.\n\n3. The number of fully diluted Anglo American shares assumed excludes \"Own Shares\" as defined in Anglo American's 2023 annual report.\n\nCenterview Partners UK LLP (\"Centerview\"), which is authorised and regulated in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority, is acting exclusively as financial adviser to Anglo American and no one else in connection with the matters set out in this announcement and will not be responsible to anyone other than Anglo American for providing the protections afforded to its clients or for providing advice in relation to the contents of this announcement or any other matters referred to in this announcement.

Image: Moneyweb\n\nThere is much more at stake in the Anglo American-BHP debate than what is immediately visible, says an expert.\n\nTaddy Blecher, CEO of the Maharishi Institute, a leadership development organisation says what is missing is a reflection on what Anglo American represents to South African society.\n\n\"What is at stake relates to the very soul and purpose of these individual companies and their starkly contrasting approaches to how they do business,\" Blecher adds.\n\nHe says there have been many views addressing a range of issues related to BHP's proposed takeover of Anglo American and many reflected on commercial considerations and the views of shareholders and government.\n\n\"Throughout the history of South Africa and even today, numerous books, documentaries and plays have been written about Anglo American. Underscoring its permanence as a feature in transforming South Africa for the better for over a century.\"\n\nBlecher says Anglo American's multifaceted history and legacy are of course contested.\n\nNo one could ever argue for the merits of the hostel system, or the migrant-labour system and its harms.\n\nBut in the same vein, its role in industrialising Southern Africa, while contributing immensely to South Africa's social development, has uplifted the lives of multiple millions of South Africans, and can hardly be ignored.\n\nALSO READ: Voting with their feet: Are international investors leaving South Africa?\n\nHe points out that Anglo American's leadership consistently, and in an unbroken fashion, always committed to doing what was right, particularly when it was unfashionable to do so.\n\n\"For example, the company's mines rapidly became the most unionised in South Africa at a time when this was not popular in the mining industry.\"\n\nFor a company like Anglo American, the idea of \"stakeholder capitalism\" as we now know was always commonplace, Bloecher says.\n\nAnglo American's founder Ernest Oppenheimer already said in 1950 that the aims of the Group have been - and they still remain - to earn profits. But to earn them in such a way as to make a real and permanent contribution to the well-being of the people and the development of Southern Africa.\n\n\"Our organisation alone, which has directly educated and placed formerly unemployed individuals, earning them and their families in excess of R59 billion combined, is but a small part of the millions of lives in similar ways that Anglo American has improved.\"\n\nHerein, he says, lies the proverbial secret sauce: this is a company that has always, for better or for worse, been attuned to the idea that a company is not a plaything of a limited group of people.\n\nIt exists to generate and deliver value for shareholders, but this is not the antithesis of making \"a real and permanent\" contribution to society.\n\nALSO READ: Africa's mining struggles: Is 'positive disruption' the way to go?\n\n\"This is why every great nation needs what is typically termed 'a national champion'.\n\n\"While many of these grow beyond their country of origin and at times evolved to much smaller scales, companies as diverse as General Electric, Airbus, Michelin, Hyundai and Samsung are known in their country of origin as 'national champions'.\n\n\"Their role is not only to continue the quest for enterprise but to uphold a sense of national pride and contribution.\"\n\nBlecher says the point that has been missing in the Anglo American-BHP debate is not what the mining company ought to do, but its DNA.\n\n\"Ignoring this means that we lose sight of what is actually right for South Africa. A business that evolved over its 107-year journey is an essential link between the past and the future of our country.\"\n\nAnglo's long life has owed as much to a constant awareness of what it was and what it stood for as to its ability, right from the beginning of its long history, to change, expand and re-focus its activities to meet the demands of the time, he says.\n\nBlecher says South Africa is fortunate that despite the continuing inequity in access to education, a handful of companies committed themselves to opening the doors of learning for many and Anglo American is a standout leader amongst these.\n\nHe says the list is endless when considering Anglo Americans contribution to education.\n\nThe company recently committed R1 billion to education over a ten-year programme, making it the largest private sector-funded education programme in South Africa.\n\nALSO READ: Elections 2024: investors keeping their options open\n\n\"When we started one of our first bold attempts at making tertiary education inclusive and free, decades before the 'fees must fall' movement, we quickly realised we would need a location that would address the scale required for a venture to educate tens of thousands of youth, which was once again generously donated by the company.\"\n\nThrough the success and evolution of the Maharishi Invincibility Institute, Anglo came to the party once more in 2023, Blecher says, handing over one of the crown jewels in its history to serve the youth of the city of Johannesburg - the 45 Main Street building.\n\nHe says the Maharishi Invincibility Institute's relationship with Anglo American, which started originally in 1979, through its mother non-profit association, has grown from strength to strength over many decades.\n\n\"In a world where global markets are fiercely competitive and resources, such as copper, are increasingly scarce, it is only natural to expect that companies will often merge, dissolve and re-emerge.\n\n\"But what we cannot accept is the erasure of the DNA of a company like Anglo, which is at the very fabric of much that is good in our society.\"\n\nBlecher emphasises that this ethos made Anglo not just a company, but a distinctive and essential part of South Africa's communities.\n\n\"As decisions are made in boardrooms by others in far-flung places, those involved must consider Anglo's unique role in South African society and reflect on preserving the values that have long set it apart.\"", "source": {"uri": "citizen.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Citizen"},

Rio the same. In terms of their portfolio skew they are still very heavily weighted to iron-ore ... you are going to see more deals,\" he said, speaking at the AFR Mining Summit in Perth.\n\nAnglo has twice rejected overtures by BHP, whose deadline to make a third offer expires later on Wednesday. Instead, Anglo has pledged to break up its company to lower costs.\n\nWhether Anglo's management decide to engage with BHP on Tuesday, investors expect more interest in the sector as copper prices, which hit a record above $11 000 a tonne on Monday, climb and encourage new projects.\n\nRising prices will only make competition for copper assets more intense, said Brett Beatty, partner and managing director Australia, of private equity company Resource Capital Funds.\n\nBeatty said he had faced internal questions over whether RCF had overpaid for the 11.9% stake in Botswana's Khoemecau copper mine that it bought for $70 million in 2019.\n\nThat stake was sold when China's MMG bought the mine for $1.88-billion six months ago, making it worth some $224-million, roughly a two-fold return.\n\n\"It's a market where you have to take risk and you'll be rewarded for it, but if you sit on the sidelines you're going to miss out,\" he said.\n\nGiven that lithium prices have begun to recover from rock bottom lows, for companies with the funding, now is a good time to buy, said Joshua Thurlow, head of lithium at Australian diversified miner Mineral Resources.\n\n\"M&A's on people's minds. It's at that point in the cycle. If you can be counter cyclical ... you could argue this is a good time to do it,\" he told Reuters.\n\n\"But also sometimes it takes a lot of gusto and a major balance sheet strengthening process to be able to do it,\" he added.\n\nMinRes embarked on an acquisition spree of significant stakes in Australian lithium developers last year.\n\n\"As we continue to look around the goldfield and more prospective areas we will continue to make deals if and when possible,\" he added.\n\nBeyond copper and lithium, there is even interest in unloved nickel whose prices have been hit by a surge in Indonesian supply.\n\nWyloo Metals will in coming weeks put its Western Australian nickel operations on care and maintenance.\n\n\"For us we are trying to see beyond the next 6 to 12 months to the next 10 to 15 years,\" CEO Luca Giacovazzi said.\n\n\"We are always acquisitive and we are always looking for a longer term opportunity ...

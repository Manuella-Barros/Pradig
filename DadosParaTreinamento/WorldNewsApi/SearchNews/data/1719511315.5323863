The baby, born in the hospital in July 2022, had developed health issues subsequently and felt sick intermittently. He was brought to the hospital by his parents several times and recovered after treatment, Prof. (Dr.) Debasmita Rath of the hospital\u2019s Pediatrics department said. The infant was again admitted into the hospital about a fortnight ago and was diagnosed with meningitis, she said. After being treated in the ICU, the baby suffered septic shock and was declared brain dead Saturday. The infant\u2019s parents, Gouri Shankar Panigrahi and. Sharmistha Panigrahi, both city-based artists, then expressed their desire to donate the organs of the baby to help other patients elsewhere requiring transplant. The hospital authorities passed on the information to the State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (SOTTO) who, in turn, got in touch with the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO) to take the matter forward. It was decided that the liver of the infant would be flown to the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) at New Delhi for a baby awaiting transplantation. The kidneys were taken to a city-based hospital for another patient needing a transplant. A team from AIIMS Bhubaneswar harvested the liver to be taken to New Delhi for which the police had prepared a green corridor for smooth passage to Biju Patnaik Airport. Prof. (Dr.) Rachita Sarangi, Acting Medical superintendent of the hospital, said this was the first time in Odisha that the organs of such a small baby had been harvested to help save lives elsewhere. A disconsolate Sharmistha, mother of the baby, said though she was heartbroken as her baby did not survive, she got consolation from the fact that the organs of her child would help another baby live on elsewhere.

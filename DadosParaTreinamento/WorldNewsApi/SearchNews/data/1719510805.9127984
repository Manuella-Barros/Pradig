I was sorry to read that Nicky has written her last regular column for the Inverness Courier. I have read her columns with interest over the years. I seem to remember the one about her 40th birthday. I have not always agreed with what she said and once or twice I have written to the Courier/Nicky to state my views. I do admire her though for putting her thoughts into print and, occasionally, her neck on the chopping board. I wish Nicky all the best in the future and thank her for many enjoyable columns. Audrey Whitfield Address supplied What firms would you like to see in city? We asked readers what businesses currently missing from the Inverness city centre offering they would like to see come to town. \u201cWe have to travel to Aberdeen to visit Costco\u2026.. I always wondered why Inverness doesn\u2019t have one?\u201d - Kay Corban \u201cNew big music venue will get more tourists back.\u201d - Laser Go - VR \u201cAnything that\u2019ll fill all the empty spaces in town and in the Eastgate.\u201d - Kayleigh Mac \u201cHollister, 5 guys, Tommy Hilfiger, USC shop, Samsung shop!!! JD Sports.\u201d - Daniel Roberts \u201cA shop that would give men\u2019s section a bit bigger than a corner of the store.\u201d - Hugh Morgan \u201cGive us some clothes shops for middle aged women and upwards.\u201d - Lottie M Lottie Tributes to \u2018inspirational\u2019 former teacher Millburn Academy in Inverness pad tribute to Sandra Patience (58), a teacher who passed away following a battle with breast cancer. The \u201clong-standing friend and colleague\u201d had worked at the school for 30 years and also took part in the Catwalk for a Cause Inverness cancer charity fundraiser this year. Many others were keen to pay their own respects online. \u201cShe was my PE teacher throughout high school, such a lovely inspirational woman sad to hear this.\u201d - Sarah-Jane Louise Cameron \u201cShe was my teacher from 1990, lovely woman, always did her best to encourage you and make sports fun and for all, very shocked.\u201d - Linda Macd Cameron \u201cSo sad reading this; Ms Patience was my PE teacher throughout high school! She was a fantastic teacher & person, I have such fond memories of her. Sending love & my thoughts to her family & friends!\u201d - Jade Mackinnon \u201cAw such a lovely lady! Great teacher & some years later she ran a great fitness class which certainly put us through our paces.\u201d - Michelle Smith \u201cWe had the wonderful privilege of working closely with Sandra in the care of her pupils whilst they were studying at UHI Inverness; she was an amazing lady, always supportive, friendly, helpful and caring. She will be greatly missed. Sending our deepest and heartfelt condolences to her family and friends.\u201d - Louise Martin-thyrs \u201cI was so sorry to hear of her passing, I had the privilege of meeting her at Catwalk for a Cause, such a lovely lady, hard to believe she is gone. Sending my condolences to her family xxx\u201d - Kirsteen Peters \u201cSo sad to hear Sandra had passed away, our fellow Catwalk model and warrior, she was a lovely lady sadly taken far too soon, thinking of her family and friends at this sad time, RIP Sandra.\u201d - Julie Cranston What now for Inverness Caledonian Thistle? After its relegation to the third flight of Scottish football for the first time since the 1990s we asked readers what they think needs to be done for the club to move forward in a more positive direction. \u201cThe words of an Orange Juice song come to mind - Rip It Up and Start Again. The board and management need to take a good look at themselves. Clubs all over the place are too quick to get rid of managers when teams do badly. I realise it is easier and less expensive to get rid of one person than a few players, but if players aren\u2019t performing, or pulling their weight, get rid! Have decent scouts looking for long term players, not just loans. Develop youth teams and community engagement. I\u2019ve heard so many bad things with youth experiences from friends who\u2019ve had sons playing there. My old boss, Donald Park, had a fab way of working with the Hibs youth team back in mid 1990s. Bring him back. Something needs done, and done urgently. Maybe hold a public meeting. Let those at the top explain decisions and put forward their plans. Face to face, not online. The folk of Inverness need to be involved, not just Caley fans. The team means a lot to even those who don\u2019t/can\u2019t go along.\u201d - Mhairi Jarvie \u201cThey should never have let go of John Robertson, the best football knowledge at the club and on good terms with the players.\u201d - Malina Macdonald-Dawson \u201cIt\u2019s clear that something has to change at the club and that most likely is at the highest level. All good and well letting Ferguson go (should that be a decision reached) but who do you bring in? But as frustrated as the fans are, to react the way they did to go on the pitch was not welcoming for younger up and coming fans! There are better ways to show the frustration of a support than the way that occurred!!\u201d - Gav Scott Letters should be submitted to newsdesk@hnmedia.co.uk.

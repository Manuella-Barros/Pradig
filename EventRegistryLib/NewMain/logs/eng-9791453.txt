To find a place that didn't break the bank, she said, they had to go smaller.\n\n\"We had a lot of things we wanted in our first home, but after looking at the price range, we had to reassess,\" Carias, a graphic designer who lives in Muscatine, Iowa, said.\n\nCompared to other countries, America is known for bigger cars, portions and take-out coffee cup sizes. For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nCarias and her partner ultimately settled on a roughly 920-square-foot home. To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nCarias and her partner ultimately settled on a roughly 920-square-foot home. To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most US suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nA view of houses built in the city of 'Levittown,' New York, circa 1947. Real estate development company Levitt & Sons built several large suburban housing developments that came to be known as 'Levittowns' in the United States and Puerto Rico.\n\nIrving Haberman/IH Images/Getty Images/File\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_delouya@cnn.com", "name": "Samantha Delouya", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-family detached home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Home_Builders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Home Builders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McMansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townhouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Townhouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take-out", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Take-out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levittown,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Levittown, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Levittown, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levitt_&_Sons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Levitt & Sons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Horton", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven.

For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory State of the housing industry Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Residential Housing Inventory by State Changes in Housing Inventory by State Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Methodology\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nCarias and her partner ultimately settled on a roughly 920-square-foot home. To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory\n\nState of the housing industry\n\nTrends in U.S. Housing Inventory\n\nResidential Housing Inventory by State\n\nChanges in Housing Inventory by State\n\nLarge Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory\n\nStates With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory\n\nMethodology", "source": {"uri": "magicvalley.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Magic Valley"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-family detached home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMansion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "McMansion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Home_Builders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Home Builders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levittown,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Levittown, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Levittown, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscatine,_Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscatine, Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Muscatine, Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Horton", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory State of the housing industry Residential Housing Inventory by State Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Methodology Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Changes in Housing Inventory by State\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon.

To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Residential Housing Inventory by State Changes in Housing Inventory by State Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory State of the housing industry Methodology\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That could be big news for first-time buyers", "body": "New homes continue to get smaller, despite the price tag getting bigger, and designers say it's time for the \"death of the hallway.\"\n\nAfter years of saving, Jordyn Carias and her partner purchased a home for the first time last month. To find a place that didn't break the bank, she said, they had to go smaller.\n\n\"We had a lot of things we wanted in our first home, but after looking at the price range, we had to reassess,\" Carias, a graphic designer who lives in Muscatine, Iowa, said.\n\nCompared to other countries, America is known for bigger cars, portions and take-out coffee cup sizes. For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Think again. Atlantic County Animal Shelter to host 'Clear the Shelters' event next month\n\nCarias and her partner ultimately settled on a roughly 920-square-foot home. To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon.

Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven.

For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Gov. Mark Robinson's wife was 'seriously deficient,' audit finds\n\nCarias and her partner ultimately settled on a roughly 920-square-foot home. To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory State of the housing industry Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Residential Housing Inventory by State Changes in Housing Inventory by State Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Methodology\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Methodology State of the housing industry Residential Housing Inventory by State Changes in Housing Inventory by State\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

To find a place that didn't break the bank, she said, they had to go smaller.\n\n\"We had a lot of things we wanted in our first home, but after looking at the price range, we had to reassess,\" Carias, a graphic designer who lives in Muscatine, Iowa, said.\n\nCompared to other countries, America is known for bigger cars, portions and take-out coffee cup sizes. For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nInterim superintendent of St. Louis Public Schools left previous job under fire Vatican rejects appeals to save two Catholic parishes in St. Louis A beloved South Grand convenience store employee was killed by customer, witnesses say Tommy Edman reflects on time in St. Louis after an 'abrupt ending': Cardinals Extra Michael Siani's injury will throw open range of options in center field: Cardinals Extra Videos show CVPA shooter stalking hallways before police storm the St. Louis school Man claims to be editor of St. Louis' Riverfront Times, defends site's OnlyFans content McClellan: Maybe Outsiders aren't the answer for St. Louis Transgender woman's use of locker room at Ellisville gym sparks outcry from conservatives At the buzzer, Cardinals send Dylan Carlson to Tampa Bay for reliever Shawn Armstrong How Cardinals capitalized on 3-team deal to acquire 2 needs, Erick Fedde and Tommy Pham How Cardinals handled trade deadline: 2 additions, 1 reunion, Dylan Carlson gets fresh start BenFred: Hey, maybe we weren't crazy for thinking Caitlin Clark should have made Team USA St. Louis County overpaid dozens of employees for years.

To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago.

For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory State of the housing industry Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Residential Housing Inventory by State Changes in Housing Inventory by State States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Methodology Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

That could be big news for first-time buyers", "body": "New homes continue to get smaller, despite the price tag getting bigger, and designers say it's time for the \"death of the hallway.\"\n\nAfter years of saving, Jordyn Carias and her partner purchased a home for the first time last month. To find a place that didn't break the bank, she said, they had to go smaller.\n\n\"We had a lot of things we wanted in our first home, but after looking at the price range, we had to reassess,\" Carias, a graphic designer who lives in Muscatine, Iowa, said.\n\nCompared to other countries, America is known for bigger cars, portions and take-out coffee cup sizes. For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had ballooned to 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nPeople are also reading...

To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nU.S. Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory State of the housing industry Trends in U.S. Housing Inventory Residential Housing Inventory by State Changes in Housing Inventory by State Large Cities With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory States With the Biggest Increase in Housing Inventory Methodology\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

But even as square footage decreased in the short term, there has been a decades-long increase in the areas of single family homes, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nThe median single family home built in 2020 had a floor area of 2,261 square feet, a 4.2% increase from 2010 and a 9.9% increase from 2000. The size of the median single family home reached a peak of 2,467 square feet in 2015 before declining to the 2020 median, a change that experts attributed to the economy's slow recovery following the financial crisis.\n\n\"Many buyers, even financially solid buyers, were shut out of the new home market,\" between 2009 and 2015, Rose Quint, National Association of Home Builders' assistant vice president for survey research, told Business Insider in 2021.\n\nPerhaps counterintuitively, the dip in the economy actually led to an increase in both the size and the quality of new homes being built during this period.\n\n\"When you look at the characteristics overall of the new homes that were started between '09 and '15, you'll see that homes got bigger and bigger, and they were more loaded with amenities year after year steadily between '09 and 2015,\" Quint told Business Insider.\n\nIn spite of these decade-by-decade increases, however, it is not the United States that leads the world in large, single-family homes.\n\nThe Perfect Rug, a website that sells custom made rugs, recently conducted an analysis on the nations with the largest home size. The company's analysis pulled data from World Population Review, Statista, Eurostat and official census records to determine the countries with the largest single family homes.\n\n\"The ranking is based on average square footage but the study also takes into consideration average household size per country as well as data for percentage of households by living members, overcrowding rate and percentage of homeowners,\" the Perfect Rug report explained.\n\nContinue reading to see which countries have the largest single-family homes.", "source": {"uri": "qz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Quartz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-family detached home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Census_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Census Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Home_Builders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Home Builders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurostat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statista", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statista"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home", "label": "dmoz/Home", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/e424f351f46d5bc647d5d6e9b697e345.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9791453", "eventUri": "eng-9791453", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

That could be big news for first-time buyers - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale", "body": "(CNN) -- After years of saving, Jordyn Carias and her partner purchased a home for the first time last month. To find a place that didn't break the bank, she said, they had to go smaller.\n\n\"We had a lot of things we wanted in our first home, but after looking at the price range, we had to reassess,\" Carias, a graphic designer who lives in Muscatine, Iowa, said.\n\nCompared to other countries, America is known for bigger cars, portions and take-out coffee cup sizes. For most of recent history, Americans have also wanted bigger homes -- but now that's changing.\n\nFor most of the last half-century, new single-family homes kept growing. In 1973, the median size of completed single-family homes was 1,525 square feet, according to US Census data. By 2015, that number had balloonedto 2,467 square feet.\n\nBut as the cost of buying a home has exploded and McMansions have fallen out of favor, homebuilders have reversed course, building smaller homes with an eye to first-time buyers. In 2023, the median single-family home built was 2,233 square feet, down 9% from the 2015 peak, with many formal dining rooms and \"bonus\" rooms disappearing.\n\nCarias and her partner ultimately settled on a roughly 920-square-foot home. To maximize space, they decided to use the basement as their primary bedroom.\n\n\"The broader trend in larger homes had been driven by what consumers wanted and demanded,\" said Alan Ratner, a homebuilder analyst at Zelman & Associates. \"More recently, we've started to see that flip almost out of necessity, because of how challenging affordability is right now.\"\n\nHomebuyers are warming up to the idea of smaller dwellings: According to an April study from the National Association of Homebuilders, the typical buyer wants a home that is 2,067 square feet -- still smaller than the typical new home size last year.\n\nLevittowns to McMansions\n\nCarias' new home was built nearly 100 years ago. Today, smaller, often more affordable homes under 1,000 square feet are harder to come by in most US suburbs.\n\nThat wasn't always the case. For a period beginning in the late-1940s, \"Levittown\" homes came to define suburban living in post-war America, Jacob Anbinder, a historian at Cornell University, said.\n\nThe housing developments, which began in the New York suburbs but spread elsewhere in the US and Puerto Rico, often fit eight 750- to 800-square foot homes on one acre.\n\n\"As many Americans became wealthier over the '40s, '50s and '60s, they wanted higher living standards and the larger homes that came with them,\" Anbinder said. \"There was almost continuous upward growth in the size of new homes.\"\n\nToday, most of the original Levittown homes no longer exist, according to Anbinder. Over the years, homeowners expanded or demolished them in favor of larger spaces.\n\nThat upward growth trend has largely tapered in recent years, though.\n\nAccording to an NAHB survey, 17% of homebuilders said they built homes on smaller lots in 2023 to support home sales, and 14% said they built more townhouses.\n\nEarlier this year, D.R. Horton, America's largest homebuilder, said it planned to reduce the size of its homes \"to address affordability for homebuyers.\" In a July earnings call, the company's chief operating officer, Michael Murray, said D.R. Horton's average house size was down 2% compared to last year.\n\nThere are signs those efforts might be helping buyers get in the door: The median sales price of existing homes jumped to $426,900 in June, according to the National Association of Realtors, while the median price of new homes in June was $417,300, according to the US Census Bureau.\n\nSmaller homes and fewer amenities\n\nHeather Eisenmann, a Realtor who specializes in selling new construction in Clarksville, Tennessee, said that she's noticed that many of the new homes she shows now have smaller bedrooms and living rooms. Many no longer have freestanding tubs to save on bathroom space, and formal dining rooms are often swapped out for kitchen islands built for bar seating, she said.\n\n\"Three years ago, we were building in a subdivision called Easthaven. Those homes were 2,500 to 3,200 square feet,\" she said. \"Everything I put on today is under 2,000.\"\n\nEisenmann said she's also recently noticed that some homebuilders are skipping expensive appliances and \"extras\" like fences and window treatments to lower a home's list price, a strategy she thinks could backfire and repel first-time buyers.\n\n\"New construction is appealing to a first-time homebuyer because it requires little to no maintenance,\" she said. \"But when they start looking at new homes that don't come with all the appliances, most of my first-time homebuyers want to turn to existing homes.\"\n\nCarias, from Muscatine, said she's happy with her new under-1,000-square-foot home and doesn't have plans to move anytime soon. She and her boyfriend relocated from the Sacramento area back to her hometown to find a home within their price range.\n\n\"Our biggest goal was getting to carve out a tiny little slice of something that is ours and not throw away our money on renting anymore,\" she said. \"I am so excited to paint and do whatever I want.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

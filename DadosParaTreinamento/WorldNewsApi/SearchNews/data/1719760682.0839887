Well, as long as \u201cbaseball\u201d can mean a version of the game played a bit differently by a bunch of youngsters in Dagestan. \u201cBaseball \u2026 This is the game which I played when I was [a kid], but we have different rules,\u201d Makhachev, who sported a Mets City Connect jersey at the ballpark that day, recently explained to The Post from Nick Catone MMA, the Brick, N.J., gym where the UFC lightweight champion and his team spent the final month of his UFC 302 training camp. \u201cI went to baseball for the first time now in a big event, and the rules are similar. It\u2019s funny.\u201d Forgive Makhachev (25-1, 16 finishes) for confusing the disappointing Mets with a \u201cbig event;\u201d he\u2019s new to the traditional format of America\u2019s pastime. That\u2019s in stark contrast to Makhachev\u2019s mastery of MMA, a sport in which he\u2019s spent half his life honing his craft, to the point that he enters Saturday\u2019s headliner at Prudential Center as the pound-for-pound No. 1 fighter on Earth defending his 155-pound crown against Dustin Poirier. A professional for 14 years, Makhachev\u2019s development came under the wing of Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, referred to as \u201cFather\u201d by all his proteges including his UFC Hall of Fame son Khabib Nurmagomedov. Father has been gone nearly four years now, a victim of COVID-19 during the throes of the pandemic, just three months before his son retired as the unbeaten UFC lightweight champion. It fell to Khabib to take the lead for a small group of men from a small corner of Russia who\u2019ve frequently dominated the competition for years. As far as Makhachev is concerned, the son has admirably filled Father\u2019s shoes. \u201cAlmost the same because [Khabib] now pushes us very hard, and his father had the same style,\u201d says Makhachev, 32, of his longtime friend and training partner\u2019s ways as the lead presence in the gym. \u201cThat\u2019s why I know they have almost a similar style because Khabib is his son. We are all from old school. We follow the same plan, always. Doesn\u2019t matter. The discipline which Abdulmanap gave us, we still follow right now.\u201d Pressed on how Khabib, still just 35 years old, does things differently from Father, Makhachev conceded that \u201cmaybe some things, he brings new\u201d but doubled down on \u201cdiscipline\u201d as the heart of his coach\u2019s methodology. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter if you are champion, you\u2019re a big star, doesn\u2019t matter. Everybody\u2019s the same,\u201d Makhachev said. Khabib, who Makhachev revealed Tuesday will also corner the champion for the first time since stepping back from that particular role following Makhachev\u2019s coronating win over Charles Oliveira in October 2022, was in command of their team\u2019s corner of the Jersey Shore gym owned by UFC veteran Nick Catone on the Wednesday before fight week. Even with Javier Mendez, coach and founder of vaunted American Kickboxing Academy in California, observing practice for the champion and coach with whom he worked closely during their respective times in the UFC, the floor belonged solely to Khabib and his trademark stoicism sprinkled with sly little ways of lightening the mood for his charges. Few would mistake the Dagestani crew for attention-seeking jokesters, but both Makhachev and Khabib have been known to mix in humor publicly from time to time in English as well as their native Russian. \u201cAlways like this,\u201d Makhachev says of Khabib keeping the room light at times, \u201cbecause when you\u2019re training all day, the same things, if you try to be serious [all the time], it\u2019s very hard. You have to love your job, you know? You have to come, smile, be [there] with good energy.\u201d Khabib\u2019s absence from the corner of Makhachev did no harm to the results in the octagon, as the champion is coming off a 2023 in which he successfully defended his title twice against then-featherweight champion Alexander Volkanovski. Nonetheless, Khabib earned additional respect during his time cornering fighters since retirement, and his voice of experience figures to bring only positives against Poirier (30-8, 23 finishes), the longtime lightweight star whose first of two unsuccessful previous attempts to become the undisputed champion ended in a submission loss to Nurmagomedov in 2019. Makhachev has ribbed Poirier multiple times over the challenger\u2019s long history of unsuccessfully fishing for guillotine choke victories \u2014 including a solid attempt on Khabib in their fight \u2014 but speaks respectfully of his opponent overall. Nonetheless, the champion needs only to look around the mat to find the confidence that he\u2019ll emerge victorious in Newark this weekend. \u201cI have much better training partners than Dustin,\u201d Makhachev asserts. \u201cHigh-level striking guys.\u201d", "summary": "The Mets\u2019 4-1 loss to the Braves at Citi Field on May 11 wasn\u2019t the first time Islam Makhachev experienced baseball.", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/05/29/sports/islam-makhachev-empowered-by-khabib-nurmagomedov-in-ufc-302-corner/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/PXL_20240522_150555597.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:36:08", "author": "Scott Fontana", "authors": ["Scott Fontana"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.235}

(AP) -- Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday became the first member of the U.S. Supreme Court to call publicly for beefing up its new ethics code by adding a way to enforce it.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the nation's highest court wrapped up its term earlier this month, Kagan said she wouldn't have signed onto the new rules if she didn't believe they were good. But having good rules is not enough, she said.\n\n\"The thing that can be criticized is, you know, rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them, and this one -- this set of rules -- does not,\" Kagan said at an annual judicial conference held by the 9th Circuit. More than 150 judges, attorneys, court personnel and others attended.\n\nIt would be difficult to figure out who should enforce the ethics code, though it should probably be other judges, the liberal justice said, adding that another difficult question is what should happen if the rules are broken. Kagan proposed that Chief Justice John Roberts could appoint a committee of respected judges to enforce the rules.\n\nDemocrats, including President Joe Biden, have renewed talk of Supreme Court reforms, including possible term limits and an ethics code enforceable by law.\n\nThe court had been considering adopting an ethics code for several years, but the effort took on added urgency after ProPublica reported last year that Justice Clarence Thomas did not disclose luxury trips he accepted from a major Republican donor. ProPublica also reported on an undisclosed trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito, and The Associated Press published stories on both liberal and conservative justices engaging in partisan activity.\n\nEarlier this year, Alito was again criticized after The New York Times reported that an upside-down American flag, a symbol associated with former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud, was displayed outside his home. Alito said he had no involvement in the flag being flown upside down.\n\nPublic confidence in the court has slipped sharply in recent years. In June, a survey for The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 4 in 10 U.S. adults have hardly any confidence in the justices and 70% believe they are more likely to be guided by their own ideology rather than serving as neutral arbiters.\n\nKagan, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, said Thursday that having a way to enforce the ethics code would also protect justices if they are wrongly accused of misconduct.\n\n\"Both in terms of enforcing the rules against people who have violated them but also in protecting people who haven't violated them -- I think a system like that would make sense,\" she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on a range of contentious issues this term, from homelessness to abortion access to presidential immunity. Kagan was in the minority as she opposed decisions to clear the way for states to enforce homeless encampment bans and make former presidents broadly immune from criminal prosecution of official acts. Kagan joined with the court's eight other justices in preserving access to mifepristone, an abortion medication.\n\nKagan has spoken in the past about how the court is losing trust in the eyes of the public. She said after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 that judges could lose legitimacy if they're seen as \"an extension of the political process or when they're imposing their own personal preferences.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) -- Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday became the first member of the U.S. Supreme Court to call publicly for beefing up its new ethics code by adding a way to enforce it.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the nation's highest court wrapped up its term earlier this month, Kagan said she wouldn't have signed onto the new rules if she didn't believe they were good. But having good rules is not enough, she said.\n\n\"The thing that can be criticized is, you know, rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them, and this one -- this set of rules -- does not,\" Kagan said at an annual judicial conference held by the 9th Circuit. More than 150 judges, attorneys, court personnel and others attended.\n\nIt would be difficult to figure out who should enforce the ethics code, though it should probably be other judges, the liberal justice said, adding that another difficult question is what should happen if the rules are broken. Kagan proposed that Chief Justice John Roberts could appoint a committee of respected judges to enforce the rules.\n\nDemocrats, including President Joe Biden, have renewed talk of Supreme Court reforms, including possible term limits and an ethics code enforceable by law.\n\nThe court had been considering adopting an ethics code for several years, but the effort took on added urgency after ProPublica reported last year that Justice Clarence Thomas did not disclose luxury trips he accepted from a major Republican donor. ProPublica also reported on an undisclosed trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito, and The Associated Press published stories on both liberal and conservative justices engaging in partisan activity.\n\nEarlier this year, Alito was again criticized after The New York Times reported that an upside-down American flag, a symbol associated with former President Donald Trump's false claims of election fraud, was displayed outside his home. Alito said he had no involvement in the flag being flown upside down.\n\nPublic confidence in the court has slipped sharply in recent years. In June, a survey for The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 4 in 10 U.S. adults have hardly any confidence in the justices and 70% believe they are more likely to be guided by their own ideology rather than serving as neutral arbiters.\n\nKagan, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, said Thursday that having a way to enforce the ethics code would also protect justices if they are wrongly accused of misconduct.\n\n\"Both in terms of enforcing the rules against people who have violated them but also in protecting people who haven't violated them -- I think a system like that would make sense,\" she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on a range of contentious issues this term, from homelessness to abortion access to presidential immunity. Kagan was in the minority as she opposed decisions to clear the way for states to enforce homeless encampment bans and make former presidents broadly immune from criminal prosecution of official acts. Kagan joined with the court's eight other justices in preserving access to mifepristone, an abortion medication.\n\nKagan has spoken in the past about how the court is losing trust in the eyes of the public. She said after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 that judges could lose legitimacy if they're seen as \"an extension of the political process or when they're imposing their own personal preferences.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP) - Justice Elena Kagan on Thursday became the first member of the U.S. Supreme Court to call publicly for beefing up its new ethics code by adding a way to enforce it.\n\nIn her first public remarks since the nation's highest court wrapped up its term earlier this month, Kagan said she wouldn't have signed onto the new rules if she didn't believe they were good. But having good rules is not enough, she said.\n\n\"The thing that can be criticized is, you know, rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them, and this one - this set of rules - does not,\" Kagan said at an annual judicial conference held by the 9th Circuit. More than 150 judges, attorneys, court personnel and others attended.\n\nIt would be difficult to figure out who should enforce the ethics code, though it should probably be other judges, the liberal justice said, adding that another difficult question is what should happen if the rules are broken. Kagan proposed that Chief Justice John Roberts could appoint a committee of respected judges to enforce the rules.\n\nDemocrats, including President Joe Biden, have renewed talk of Supreme Court reforms, including possible term limits and an ethics code enforceable by law.\n\nThe court had been considering adopting an ethics code for several years, but the effort took on added urgency after ProPublica reported last year that Justice Clarence Thomas did not disclose luxury trips he accepted from a major Republican donor. ProPublica also reported on an undisclosed trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito, and The Associated Press published stories on both liberal and conservative justices engaging in partisan activity.\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan sits on a panel at the 2024 Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference in Sacramento, Calif., Thursday, July 25, 2024.

(AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli)\n\nEarlier this year, Alito was again criticized after The New York Times reported that an upside-down American flag, a symbol associated with former President Donald Trump\u00b4s false claims of election fraud, was displayed outside his home. Alito said he had no involvement in the flag being flown upside down.\n\nPublic confidence in the court has slipped sharply in recent years. In June, a survey for The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 4 in 10 U.S. adults have hardly any confidence in the justices and 70% believe they are more likely to be guided by their own ideology rather than serving as neutral arbiters.\n\nKagan, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, said Thursday that having a way to enforce the ethics code would also protect justices if they are wrongly accused of misconduct.\n\n\"Both in terms of enforcing the rules against people who have violated them but also in protecting people who haven't violated them - I think a system like that would make sense,\" she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on a range of contentious issues this term, from homelessness to abortion access to presidential immunity. Kagan was in the minority as she opposed decisions to clear the way for states to enforce homeless encampment bans and make former presidents broadly immune from criminal prosecution of official acts. Kagan joined with the court's eight other justices in preserving access to mifepristone, an abortion medication.\n\nKagan has spoken in the past about how the court is losing trust in the eyes of the public. She said after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 that judges could lose legitimacy if they're seen as \"an extension of the political process or when they\u00b4re imposing their own personal preferences.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Kagan joined with the court's eight other justices in preserving access to mifepristone, an abortion medication.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Alito"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ProPublica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Thomas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clarence Thomas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Term limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alaska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mifepristone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mifepristone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homelessness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homelessness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/AoxPynCekIG3d6R4XbRqD8MS-vo=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/MTGXVGHQ7T6S76UG4QG7EONTZA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764545", "eventUri": "eng-9764545", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Roberts Jr. could appoint an outside panel of highly respected judges to review allegations of wrongdoing.\n\nBy Ann E. Marimow\n\nJuly 25, 2024 at 4:41 p.m. EDT\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Justice Elena Kagan said Thursday that she would support the creation of a committee of judges to examine potential violations of the Supreme Court's new ethics code, speaking out as President Biden and others are increasingly calling for reform at the high court.\n\nIn an interview before a crowd of judges and lawyers at a judicial conference, Kagan suggested that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. could appoint an outside panel of highly respected, experienced judges to review allegations of wrongdoing by the nine justices.\n\nLast fall, in response to criticism from Democratic lawmakers and outside experts about perceived ethics violations, Roberts announced that the court for the first time had agreed to abide by an ethics code specific to the justices. But the policy did not include a way to examine alleged misconduct, or to clear or sanction justices who might violate the rules. Since then, a new round of ethical questions, and the court's rulings this term, have increased calls for change.\n\nKagan said the court's code of conduct, embraced by all the justices, is a \"good one,\" but said criticism about the inability to enforce it is \"fair.\" ... \"Rules usually have enforcement mechanisms attached to them, and this one, this set of rules, does not,\" she said, adding that \"however hard it is, we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this.\"\n\n{snip}\n\nBy Ann Marimow\n\nAnn Marimow covers the Supreme Court for The Washington Post.

She also did not rule out the possibility that Congress could pass a law requiring something similar, as many Democrats in Congress have endorsed. In her remarks to the same conference last year, Kagan disputed her colleague Justice Samuel Alito's public claim that Congress has no role to play in policing ethics at the high court.\n\nKagan made no direct reference Thursday to the ethics claims that have swirled over two of her conservative colleagues over the past couple of years: Alito was accused of failing to report a private airplane flight to Alaska paid for by a wealthy Republican donor, and Justice Clarence Thomas faced stories disclosing that he'd vacationed by private yacht with another major GOP donor. Alito and Thomas also faced calls to recuse themselves from cases stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, after their wives seemed to show solidarity with those who sought to overturn the election.\n\nCreating an enforcement mechanism, Kagan suggested, would be preferable to the current system where justices basically decide for themselves whether they are guilty of violating the code.\n\n\"It would provide a sort of safe harbor. ... Sometimes people accuse us of misconduct where we haven't engaged in misconduct. And, so, I think both in terms of enforcing the rules against people who have violated them, but also in protecting people who haven't violated them, I think a system like that would make sense,\" she said.\n\nA Supreme Court spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the chief justice, but Kagan said she was by no means suggesting any consensus on the court in favor of any enforcement regime.\n\n\"I'm doing no intimating here,\" said Kagan. \"This is one person's view.\"\n\nDuring an hourlong onstage interview conducted by a judge and an attorney at a convention center a few blocks from the state Capitol, Kagan also lamented what she described as a current tendency by the justices to splinter in significant cases -- sometimes largely agreeing on a result, but laying out very different rationales for reaching it.\n\n\"We don't seem to be able to coalesce all that easily on some cases,\" Kagan said. \"There is a lot of separate writing that the court is doing right now. ... It's not a good thing for the court. It prevents us, I think, from giving the kind of guidance that lower courts have the right to expect and that the public has the right to expect. It muddies the waters.\"\n\nKagan also complained that some of her colleagues use concurring opinions to try to recast the majority's view. She noted that in a major gun rights case decided last month, the decision was nominally 8-1, but the court produced seven opinions. Kagan, who joined a concurrence by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, said some mischief was afoot in the plethora of opinions.\n\n\"Everybody sort of tries to spin it one way or another,\" Kagan said. \"Often people use separate opinions to pre-decide issues that aren't properly before the court and that may come before the court in a year or two and try to give signals as to how lower courts should decide that, which I don't think is right.\"\n\nKagan said efforts by individual justices to offer their own take on what the court decided create confusion. \"I don't know how lower courts are supposed to deal with it really. Mostly, I think they should deal with it by ignoring it, basically,\" she said.\n\nKagan acknowledged profound disappointment with some of the rulings the court issued in the current term, as the three liberal justices often found themselves outvoted by the phalanx of six conservatives they now face on the bench. However, she said she doesn't retreat to her office and cry as Sotomayor, speaking to an audience at Harvard in May, said she has sometimes done in recent years.\n\n\"I'm not much of a crier, myself,\" Kagan quipped. \"I get where the frustration comes from. I'm more of a wall-slammer.\"\n\nKagan said the cases that trouble her the most are where she believes her colleagues aren't adhering to principle or are straying beyond what she views as the proper role for judges.\n\n\"Courts shouldn't use individual cases as vehicles to advance some broader agenda or some broader project to change our governance structure or our society,\" she said. \"Hopefully, it doesn't happen much, but there have been cases in the last few years in which it has happened to my lights, at least.\"\n\nKagan did not discuss the largely 6-3 decision the court issued earlier this month upholding much of former President Donald Trump's arguments that he and other presidents enjoy immunity from criminal charges for their official acts.\n\nHowever, she struck a theme she has in some other appearances where she's suggested that there is a degree of banality and even misdirection in anecdotes some of her colleagues offer about the social interactions among the justices.\n\n\"I get frustrated sometimes when people talk about the collegiality question,\" Kagan said. \"Some of my colleagues share a great love of baseball. Some of my colleagues share a great love of golf. ... That's good for the court, but I can't imagine why the public should care.\"\n\nKagan said the social engagement matters only if it means the justices are engaging with each other's legal arguments and trying to reach consensus where possible.\n\n\"Sometimes going to the opera together might produce that result; sometimes not,\" she said.\n\nThe only ruling from this term that Kagan addressed in detail was the Supreme Court's decision overturning a 40-year old precedent, known as the Chevron doctrine, that required judges to defer to federal agencies' interpretation of relevant congressional statutes when those interpretations were reasonable. The court's ruling last month, which split the justices 6-3 along ideological lines, said judges should interpret the law as they see fit in most instances where agency actions are challenged.\n\nKagan dissented from that decision and would have left the longstanding doctrine in place, but she said it's not clear whether federal agencies will actually find their authority gutted as a result.\n\n\"I'm not exactly sure how it's going to play out,\" she said. The justice noted that judges still have to pay \"appropriate respect\" to agency expertise, and Congress still has the power to explicitly grant agencies discretion about the scope of their authority. She also said some judges may struggle to resolve issues that are more about policy than law.\n\n\"The dictionary is not going to tell you much,\" Kagan said. \"There's going to be a lot of uncertainty and a lot of instability on that front.\"\n\nWhile some critics have faulted the court for taking many fewer cases each term than it used to decades ago, Kagan said she still finds the workload pretty heavy, largely due to an increasing volume of emergency applications presented on what some call the court's \"shadow docket.\" She said the court probably brought the tsunami of urgent applications on itself by granting several such petitions blocking Trump administration actions, but that the phenomenon means there's no real time off for her or her clerks.\n\n\"Our summers used to be, actually, summers,\" Kagan said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Alito",

The justices adopted a code of conduct for the first time in November in response to growing demands for transparency and accountability, but it's been criticized for lacking an enforcement mechanism.\n\nKagan, in response to a moderator's question at the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit's annual judicial conference, acknowledged there are difficulties in deciding who should enforce an ethics code for the justices.\n\n\"But I feel as though we, however hard it is, that we could and should try to figure out some mechanism for doing this,\" she said.\n\nDuring a discussion with lawyer Roger Townsend and US Bankruptcy Judge Madeleine Wanslee, Kagan also criticized her colleagues for writing multiple opinions in a single case, saying it complicates matters for lower courts.\n\n\"It prevents us, I think, from giving the kind of guidance that lower courts have a right to expect, that the public has a right to expect,\" she said.\n\nWhile there are times when separate writings make sense, Kagan said justices shouldn't be writing separately just because they would have written the majority decision differently. The court should have a \"higher threshold\" than that, she said.\n\nKagan cited the court's fractured decision in the United States v. Rahimi gun case. The court upheld a federal law that bans people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing a gun in a 8-1 decision in which seven of the nine justices wrote their own opinions despite there being only one dissent.\n\nThe opinions signaled divisions among the justices on how to use history and tradition to analyze the constitutionality of firearm restrictions in the wake of the court's 2022 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association Inc. v.

In June, a survey for The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 4 in 10 U.S. adults have hardly any confidence in the justices and 70% believe they are more likely to be guided by their own ideology rather than serving as neutral arbiters.\n\nKagan, who was nominated to the Supreme Court in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama, said Thursday that having a way to enforce the ethics code would also protect justices if they are wrongly accused of misconduct.\n\n\"Both in terms of enforcing the rules against people who have violated them but also in protecting people who haven't violated them -- I think a system like that would make sense,\" she said.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled on a range of contentious issues this term, from homelessness to abortion access to presidential immunity. Kagan was in the minority as she opposed decisions to clear the way for states to enforce homeless encampment bans and make former presidents broadly immune from criminal prosecution of official acts. Kagan joined with the court's eight other justices in preserving access to mifepristone, an abortion medication.\n\nKagan has spoken in the past about how the court is losing trust in the eyes of the public. She said after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 that judges could lose legitimacy if they're seen as \"an extension of the political process or when they're imposing their own personal preferences.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Sherman in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nAustin is a corps member for The Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

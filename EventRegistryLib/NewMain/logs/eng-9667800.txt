If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational.\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nMedia reports at the time alleged Kaspersky Lab was involved in taking hacking tools from a National Security Agency employee that ended up in the hands of the Russian government. Kaspersky responded by saying it had stumbled upon the code but said no third parties saw it.\n\nPressure on the company's US business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The US government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in today's action.\n\nThe delayed unveiling of the prohibition is due in part to a \"significant back and forth\" with Kaspersky, which proposed mitigating measures instead of an outright ban, the source said.\n\nHowever, the agency concluded that the threats, especially the ties to the Russian government, meant \"there really were no mitigating measures that could be implemented to address those risks.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department. If someone wilfully violates the prohibition, the Justice Department can bring a criminal case. Software users will not face legal penalties but will be strongly encouraged to stop using it.\n\nKaspersky, which has a UK holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of US$752 million ($1.13 billion) in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries.", "source": {"uri": "itnews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

The software's privileged access to a computer's systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers or install malware and withhold critical updates, enhancing the threat, a source added.\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and... the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans and that is why we are compelled to take the action that we are taking today,\" Raimondo said on the call.\n\nKaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe sweeping new rule, using broad powers created by the Trump administration, will be coupled with another move to add three units of the company to a trade restriction list, Raimondo said, dealing a blow to the firm's reputation that could hammer its overseas sales.\n\nThe plan to add the cybersecurity company to the entity list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales prohibition were first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe moves show the Biden administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives.

But its UK-based unit will now be effectively barred from receiving goods from American suppliers.\n\nGROWING PRESSURE\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs.

The move aims to protect critical infrastructure and government systems from potential cyberattacks. The ban will take effect on Sept. 29, 2023.\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday announced plans to bar the sale of antivirus software made by Russia's Kaspersky Lab in the United States, citing the firm's large U.S. customers, including critical infrastructure providers and state and local governments. Moscow's influence over the company was found to pose a significant risk, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on a briefing call with reporters on Thursday. The software's privileged access to a computer's systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers or install malware and withhold critical updates, enhancing the threat, a source added.\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and... the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans and that is why we are compelled to take the action that we are taking today,\" Raimondo said on the call. Kaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe sweeping new rule, using broad powers created by the Trump administration, will be coupled with another move to add three units of the company to a trade restriction list, Raimondo said, dealing a blow to the firm's reputation that could hammer its overseas sales. The plan to add the cybersecurity company to the entity list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales prohibition were first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe moves show the Biden administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia. It also shows the administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\n\"We would never give an adversarial nation the keys to our networks or devices, so it's crazy to think that we would continue to allow Russian software with the deepest possible device access to be sold to Americans,\" said Democratic Senator Mark Warner, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nSales of white-labeled products -- that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name -- will also be barred, the source said, adding that the Commerce Department will notify companies before taking enforcement action against them. The Commerce Department will also entity list two Russian and one UK-based unit of Kaspersky for allegedly cooperating with Russian military intelligence to support Moscow's cyber intelligence goals.\n\nKaspersky's Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But its UK-based unit will now be effectively barred from receiving goods from American suppliers. GROWING PRESSURE\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks. Media reports at the time alleged Kaspersky Lab was involved in taking hacking tools from a National Security Agency employee that ended up in the hands of the Russian government. Kaspersky responded by saying it had stumbled upon the code but said no third parties saw it.\n\nPressure on the company's U.S. business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv. The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported. The war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up a national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action.\n\nUnder the new rules, sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department, the source added. If someone willfully violates the prohibition, the Justice Department can bring a criminal case. Software users will not face legal penalties but will be strongly encouraged to stop using it. Kaspersky, which has a British holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and

The ban aims to protect critical infrastructure and mitigate cyber threats. The move follows long-standing concerns about Kaspersky's ties to Russian intelligence.\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday announced plans to bar the sale of antivirus software made by Russia's Kaspersky Lab in the United States, citing the firm's large U.S. customers, including critical infrastructure providers and state and local governments. Moscow's influence over the company was found to pose a significant risk, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on a briefing call with reporters on Thursday. The software's privileged access to a computer's systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers or install malware and withhold critical updates, enhancing the threat, a source added.\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and... the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans and that is why we are compelled to take the action that we are taking today,\" Raimondo said on the call. Kaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe sweeping new rule, using broad powers created by the Trump administration, will be coupled with another move to add three units of the company to a trade restriction list, Raimondo said, dealing a blow to the firm's reputation that could hammer its overseas sales. The plan to add the cybersecurity company to the entity list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales prohibition were first reported by Reuters.\n\nThe moves show the Biden administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia. It also shows the administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested. Former President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced. Sales of white-labeled products -- that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name -- will also be barred, the source said, adding that the Commerce Department will notify companies before taking enforcement action against them.\n\nThe Commerce Department will also entity list two Russian and one UK-based unit of Kaspersky for allegedly cooperating with Russian military intelligence to support Moscow's cyber intelligence goals. Kaspersky's Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. But its UK-based unit will now be effectively barred from receiving goods from American suppliers.\n\nGROWING PRESSURE Kaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nMedia reports at the time alleged Kaspersky Lab was involved in taking hacking tools from a National Security Agency employee that ended up in the hands of the Russian government. Kaspersky responded by saying it had stumbled upon the code but said no third parties saw it. Pressure on the company's U.S. business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv. The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up a national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action. The delayed unveiling of the prohibition is due in part to a \"significant back and forth\" with Kaspersky, which proposed mitigating measures instead of an outright ban, the source said.\n\nHowever, the agency concluded that the threats, especially the ties to the Russian government, meant \"there really were no mitigating measures that could be implemented to address those risks.\" Under the new rules, sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department, the source added. If someone willfully violates the prohibition, the Justice Department can bring a criminal case. Software users will not face legal penalties but will be strongly encouraged to stop using it.\n\nKaspersky, which has a British holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and

Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nSales of white-labeled products--that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name--will also be barred, the source said, noting that the Commerce Department will notify the companies before taking enforcement action against them.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any U.S.-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational.\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nMedia reports at the time alleged Kaspersky Lab was involved in taking hacking tools from a National Security Agency employee that ended up in the hands of the Russian government. Kaspersky responded by saying it had stumbled upon the code but said no third parties saw it.\n\nPressure on the company's U.S. business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action.\n\nThe delayed unveiling of the prohibition is due in part to a \"significant back and forth\" with Kaspersky, which proposed mitigating measures instead of an outright ban, the source said.\n\nHowever, the agency concluded that the threats, especially the ties to the Russian government, meant \"there really were no mitigating measures that could be implemented to address those risks.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department. If someone willfully violates the prohibition, the Justice Department can bring a criminal case. Software users will not face legal penalties but will be strongly encouraged to stop using it.\n\nKaspersky, which has a U.K. holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.\n\nReporting by Alexandra Alper; additional reporting by Christopher Bing, Raphael Satter and Karen Freifeld; editing by Chris Sanders and Lisa Shumaker.

The software's privileged access to a computer's systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers or install malware and withhold critical updates, enhancing the threat, a source added.\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and ... the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans and that is why we are compelled to take the action that we are taking today.\n\nKaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to Russian government.\n\nTechCrunch reported the U.S. government announced on Thursday that it is banning the sale of Kaspersky antivirus in the country, and is asking Americans who use the software to switch to a different provider.\n\nThe Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security said it imposed the \"first of its kind\" ban, arguing that Kaspersky threatens U.S. national security users' privacy because the company is based in Russia.\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity, and even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans. And that's why we are compelled to take the action that we're taking today,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a call with reporters.\n\nNews of the ban was first reported by Reuters ahead of the announcement. A Kaspersky spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.\n\nKaspersky will be banned from selling its software to American consumers and businesses starting July 20, but the company will be able to provide software and security updates to existing customers until September 29. After that, Kaspersky will no longer be permitted to push software updates to U.S. customers, according to Raimondo.\n\nEngadget reported the Russian company has been the topic of cybersecurity questions many times over the years. The Federal Communications Commission put Kaspersky on its list of companies posing unacceptable security risks in 2022.\n\nIn 2017, Kaspersky products were banned from use in US federal agencies, and the business also drew scrutiny from the UK's cybersecurity leadership.\n\nIn my opinion, if you are currently using Kaspersky Lab's product - you should dump it and find something better - and safer - as soon as possible.", "source": {"uri": "geeknewscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Geek News Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Raimondo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gina Raimondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Industry and Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engadget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Engadget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://geeknewscentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Kaspersky-logo-larger.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 2100, "textEnd": 2107}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-29", "textStart": 2207, "textEnd": 2219}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nSales of white-labeled products -- that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name -- will also be barred, the source said, noting that the Commerce Department will notify the companies before enforcing.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any U.S.-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational.\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs.

Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the US has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between US firms and Internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sep 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New US business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nSales of white-labelled products - that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name - will also be barred, the source said, noting that the Commerce Department will notify the companies before enforcing.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping US export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any US-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the US, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational.\n\nKaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nPressure on the company's US business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The US government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action.\n\nThe delayed unveiling of the prohibition is due in part to a \"significant back and forth\" with Kaspersky, which proposed mitigating measures instead of an outright ban, the source said.\n\nHowever, the agency concluded that the threats, especially the ties to the Russian government, meant \"there really were no mitigating measures that could be implemented to address those risks.\"\n\nUnder the new rules, sellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines from the Commerce Department. If someone wilfully violates the prohibition, the Justice Department can bring a criminal case. Software users will not face legal penalties but will be strongly encouraged to stop using it.\n\nKaspersky, which has a UK holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of US$752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\n45% (87M) in less than 1 minute. 14% (27M) - from 1 min to 1 hour. 8% (15M) - from 1 hour to 1 day. 6% (12M) - from 1 day to 1 month. 4% (8M) - from 1 month to 1 year.\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nNames: \"ahmed\", \"nguyen\", \"kumar\", \"kevin\", \"daniel\". Popular words: \"forever\", \"love\", \"google\", \"hacker\", \"gamer\". Standard passwords: \"password\", \"qwerty12345\", \"admin\", \"12345\", \"team\".\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nUse a different password for each service. That way, even if one of your accounts is stolen, the rest won't go with it. Passphrases might be more secure when unexpected words are used. Even if you are resort to common words, you can arrange them in an unusual order and make sure they are unrelated. It's better not to use passwords that can be easily guessed from your personal information, such as birthdays, names of family members, pets, or your own name. These are often the first guesses an attacker will try. It's nearly impossible to memorise long and unique passwords for all the services you use, but with a special solution, such as Kaspersky password manager (http://apo-opa.co/3XuZDlm), you can memorise just one master password. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA). While not directly related to password strength, enabling 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone discovers your password, they would still need a second form of verification to access your account. Modern password managers (http://apo-opa.co/3XuZDlm) store 2FA keys and secure them with the latest encryption algorithms. Using a reliable security solution such as Kaspersky Premium (http://apo-opa.co/4cbAC3o) will enhance your protection. It monitors the Internet and Dark Web and warns if your passwords need to be changed.\n\nAdditional information can be found in the research material on Securelist (http://apo-opa.co/3Rzi5pj) and Kaspersky Daily post (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk).\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Kaspersky.\n\nFor further information please contact:\n\nNicole Allman\n\nINK&Co.

Kaspersky's alleged close ties to the Russian government were found to pose a critical risk. The software's privileged access to American computer systems could potentially allow Russian actors to steal sensitive information, install malware, or withhold critical updates, sources told Reuters before the official announcement.\n\nThe Russian cybersecurity firm has struggled to regain its international reputation since the United States banned Kaspersky from the federal government's computers in 2017. At the time, hackers reportedly used Kaspersky software to steal sensitive NSA documents, and Russian agents were said to use the software as a personal back door. Roughly seven years later, Biden is using broad powers created by the Trump administration to ban it nationwide. Alongside the ban, the Biden administration is adding Kaspersky to a trade restriction list, which could hamper its international reputation and sales even further.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced the restrictions on a press call with reporters on Thursday. Raimondo said the ban was the \"first of its kind,\" and that this was the result of a thorough investigation into the firm's ties to Russia.\n\n\"Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive U.S. information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard U.S. national security and the American people,\" Raimondo said in the press release\n\nKaspersky's new U.S. sales will be blocked after 30 days. After 100 days (Sept. 29), the restrictions will also bar downloads of software updates, resales, and licensing of the product. Products that integrate Kaspersky into their software, but sold under a different brand, will also be barred.\n\nKaspersky has spent the last seven years denying any ties to the Russian government. The CEO, Eugene Kaspersky, at one point offered to turn over his company's source code to the United States government. The effort did little to win the trust of any government officials.\n\nKaspersky reportedly has more than 220,000 corporate clients in 200 countries, and lists Volkswagen as one of its largest customers on its website. The antivirus software company has operations in Massachusetts.\n\nIn 2019, the story around Kaspersky deepened when a Russian court convicted a senior researcher at the company for treason in the interest of the United States. Ruslan Stoyanov, the former head of the computer incidents investigation team at Kaspersky Labs, is in the midst of serving a 14-year prison sentence.\n\nThe authority Biden is using to ban Kaspersky is a relatively new power of the executive branch. Former President Donald Trump attempted to use the same power to ban Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but he was stopped by federal courts. In that case, and this one, the executive branch is theoretically allowed to ban or restrict technology from \"foreign adversary\" nations.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news",

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nAdditional information can be found in the research material on Securelist (http://apo-opa.co/3Rzi5pj) and Kaspersky Daily post (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk).", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brute-force attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letter case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QWERTY"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 94}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Kaspersky Lab's researchers, recognized as top-tier in the cybersecurity industry, are known for analyzing hacking operations suspected of being carried out by a variety of governments including Russia, the US and Israel, but also cybercriminal threats that affect everyday users.\n\nSome of the speculation and suspicion from US officials about the Russian company centers around Eugene Kaspersky, a charismatic computer expert who co-founded Kaspersky Lab in Moscow in 1997.\n\nEugene Kaspersky studied cryptography at a KGB-sponsored university\u202f -- a fact that some\u202fUS lawmakers\u202flike to mention when trying to tie the company to Russian government. Kaspersky Lab has denied having \"any unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia.\" Kaspersky served as a software engineer at a Russian Ministry of Defense institute after graduation, and that is \"the extent of his military experience,\" the\u202fcompany says.\n\nKaspersky has\u202flamented\u202fthat his company is the victim of geopolitical tensions between the West and Russia -- \u202ftensions that have only grown sharper since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors":

United States has also not yet produced any proof on the ability of Kaspersky Lab to steal sensitive data from Americans, analysts told InfotechLead.com.\n\nKaspersky never disclosed the size of its business in the United States.\n\nThe U.S. cyber security market size was valued at $53.45 billion in 2022. The cyber security market in the US is projected to grow from $59.06 billion in 2023 to $128.99 billion by 2030, exhibiting a CAGR of 11.8 percent during the forecast period, according to market reports.\n\nThe report said the proposed ban leverages broad powers established during the Donald Trump administration and will be accompanied by the addition of Kaspersky Lab to a trade restriction list. This move is expected to significantly damage the company's international reputation and potentially harm its overseas sales. Kaspersky Lab has denied any ties to the Russian government, maintaining that it is a privately managed entity.\n\nThese actions highlight the U.S. government's efforts to mitigate risks of Russian cyberattacks through Kaspersky software, amidst ongoing tensions and Russia's intensified military actions in Ukraine. With limited new sanctions available, the Biden administration aims to exert additional pressure on Moscow, the report said.\n\nThe new restrictions, which will also prohibit software updates, resales, and licensing of Kaspersky products, will take effect on September 29. This 100-day lead time is intended to allow businesses to transition to alternative cybersecurity solutions. Any new business dealings with Kaspersky in the U.S. will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are officially announced. Additionally, the sale of white-labeled products that incorporate Kaspersky software will also be prohibited.\n\nIf the Commerce Department includes Kaspersky's foreign subsidiaries on the entity list, it could disrupt the company's supply chain by restricting access to significant U.S. inputs. However, if only the Russian entity is listed, the impact would primarily be reputational.\n\nThis development follows the Department of Homeland Security's 2017 ban on Kaspersky antivirus products from federal networks due to alleged ties to Russian intelligence and concerns over Russian laws that could compel Kaspersky to assist intelligence agencies.\n\nKaspersky Lab, which operates under a U.K. holding company and has a presence in Massachusetts, reported revenues of $752 million in 2022, serving over 220,000 corporate clients across approximately 200 countries. The company's clientele includes notable organizations such as Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain, and the Qatar Olympic Committee.", "source": {"uri":

Existing customers will also not be able to update Kaspersky software after that date.\n\nThe company will not be able to sign up any new clients after July 20. A Kaspersky Lab spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Commerce Department will also add Kaspersky Lab, Russia-based Kaspersky Group and Kaspersky Lab Limited, a United Kingdom branch, to its entity list for cooperating with the Kremlin to support the government's cyber intelligence. Namesake founder and CEO Eugene Kaspersky was one of the first major players in the antivirus industry in the 1990s.\n\nRaimondo said the moves were made after an \"extremely thorough investigation\" using authorities the department was granted in 2019 to better safeguard domestic information and communication technologies and services supply chains from threats posed by foreign adversaries.\n\n\"While we've been exploring every option at our disposal, we ultimately decided that given the Russian government's continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence Kaspersky's operations that we have to take the significant measure of a full prohibition if we're going to protect Americans and their personal data,\" she said.\n\nEugene Kaspersky at a company event in 2019. Image: Eugene Kaspersky / Flickr / CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nKaspersky Lab repeatedly has denied that it has ties to any government and has said it would not help a government with cyber-espionage.\n\nSuch protests did not stop former President Donald Trump from signing legislation in 2017 that banned the company from civilian government agencies, an action that led the U.S. relationship with the firm to deteriorate and has only worsened since Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Early that year, the Federal Communications Commission also added the company to its official list of businesses that pose a national security threat to the U.S.\n\nA senior Commerce official said authorities \"generally know\" that the Russian government \"uses whatever resources available to perpetrate various malicious cyber activity activities.\" While the department's final determination does not cite specific instances where the company has been leaned on \"we certainly believe that it's more than just a theoretical threat that we described.\"\n\n\"We fully believe that the Russian government is either now using Kaspersky or certainly would be willing to use Kaspersky,\" according to the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nWhile the exact number of the company's U.S. customers is currently confidential, Kaspersky has claimed that more than 400 million people and 240,000 companies worldwide use its software products.\n\nThe Commerce official said the department, as well as law enforcement and the intelligence community, will monitor the software upgrade ban and pursue civil or criminal enforcement actions if necessary.\n\nThe department and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) will also perform \"significant outreach\" to critical infrastructure operators that use the antivirus software to describe the risks involved and detail potential alternatives.\n\nThe official also downplayed the chances of Russia striking back against the U.S. over the ban.\n\n\"Given that there have been a number of actions taken against Kaspersky over the years, we don't anticipate a significant response from Russia,\" the official told reporters. \"But we're certainly on guard and prepared for any sort of retaliation.\"", "source":

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nAdditional information can be found in the research material on Securelist (http://apo-opa.co/3Rzi5pj) and Kaspersky Daily post (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk).\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Kaspersky.\n\nAbout Kaspersky:\n\nKaspersky is a global cybersecurity and digital privacy company founded in 1997.

The action was put on hold. Over a year later, Biden's administration once again considered banning or otherwise restricting US use of the software.

She added that \"while we've been exploring every option at our disposal, we ultimately decided that given the Russian government's continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence Kaspersky's operations, that we had to take the significant measure of a full prohibition if we're going to protect Americans and their personal data.\"\n\nAfter July 20, Kaspersky is prohibited from entering into any new agreements inside the U.S. under the new ban. Kaspersky can provide existing customers with cyber and antivirus software until Sept. 29, but after that \"Kaspersky will not be able to provide security updates.\" Software services will \"degrade,\" the rule says.\n\nMORE: What to know about the Russian cyberfirm pulled from US contractor list\n\nRaimondo said she wanted to make clear that Americans and U.S. businesses who continue to use existing Kaspersky products will not be breaking the law, but they will not be able to update their products as of Sept. 30. \"I would encourage you in the strongest possible terms to immediately stop using that software and switch to an alternative in order to protect yourself, your data, and your family,\" the commerce secretary said.\n\nABC News previously reported on the government's concerns about Kaspersky. The head of Kaspersky Lab, Eugene Kaspersky, at the time denied Russia's influence on the software company.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News in 2017, Kapersky called U.S. government warnings about his company \"wrong advice\" and said that \"rumors about our partnership with government agencies [are] false.\"\n\nUS bans Russian cybersecurity software amid threat of influence operation originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luke_barr@aol.com", "name": "Luke Barr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Raimondo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gina Raimondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Industry_and_Security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Industry and Security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Kaspersky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eugene Kaspersky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S5crGTEUpC6Odbz6M_de9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_abc_news_articles_665/ed00eefb8b229e75dfd8014f270e17b1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-20", "textStart": 1514, "textEnd": 1521}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-29", "textStart": 1701, "textEnd": 1709}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-30", "textStart": 2122, "textEnd": 2130}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 102, "textEnd": 109}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Two more sources say the new US constraint, which uses extensive powers established by the Trump administration, would put the Kaspersky on a trade restriction list.\n\nThis measure of the Biden administration may harm Kaspersky's reputation and global sales, though the details of the Kaspersky software sales ban remain undisclosed. The US Commerce Department, Kaspersky Lab, and Russian Embassy representatives declined to comment, per the report.\n\nAs its war in Ukraine continues, the US government is taking these steps to reduce the possibility of Russian cyberattacks on Kaspersky software and pressure Moscow. The Biden administration exercises a new authority to block or restrict transactions between US enterprises and \"foreign adversaries,\" including Russia and China.\n\nDuring his administration, former President Donald Trump attempted to prevent Americans from using TikTok and WeChat, but federal judges stopped him.\n\nFrom September 29, Kaspersky software will be restricted from inbound sales, upgrades, resales, and licensing. Kaspersky will prohibit new US business for 30 days following the announcement to give firms time to discover alternatives.\n\nRead Also: Tesla Owner Warns Drivers After Being Trapped Inside Car\n\nYears of regulatory scrutiny have plagued Kaspersky. Due to links to Russian intelligence and Russian regulations that allow intelligence services to force Kaspersky's help, the US Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus software from government networks in 2017.\n\nThe Commerce Department's national security inquiry into Kaspersky software prompted Thursday's action. In 2022, Kaspersky generated $752 million from over 220,000 business clients across 200 countries, including Piaggio, Volkswagen's Spanish retail subsidiary, and the Qatar Olympic Committee.\n\nLast year, all government-issued mobile devices in Canada were forbidden from using Kaspersky's security software, PC Mag reported.\n\nThe Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat announced the decision after the Chief Information Officer (CIO) found that WeChat and Kaspersky represent an unacceptable danger to privacy and security. The CIO was concerned about these applications' data collection practices, which provide them access to the device's contents.\n\nKaspersky Lab, founded in Moscow in 1997, is a major antivirus software company that competes with McAfee and Symantec. High-profile cybersecurity researchers at the organization analyze hacking efforts by Russia, the US, and Israel and cybercriminal dangers to average users.\n\nThe company's co-founder, Eugene Kaspersky, has become the main target of some of the US officials' concerns. According to CNN, US politicians typically point to Kaspersky's KGB-sponsored university cryptography studies to link his company to the Russian government.\n\nKaspersky Lab has denied unethical government relationships, including with Russia, saying that Kaspersky's post-graduation software engineering job at the Russian Ministry of Defense was \"the extent of his military experience.\"\n\nEugene Kaspersky laments that his firm fell victim to geopolitical tensions between the West and Russia, which have escalated since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.", "source": {"uri":

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\n45% (87M) in less than 1 minute.\n\n14% (27M) - from 1 min to 1 hour.\n\n8% (15M) - from 1 hour to 1 day.\n\n6% (12M) - from 1 day to 1 month.\n\n4% (8M) - from 1 month to 1 year.\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nNames: \"ahmed\", \"nguyen\", \"kumar\", \"kevin\", \"daniel\".\n\nPopular words: \"forever\", \"love\", \"google\", \"hacker\", \"gamer\".\n\nStandard passwords: \"password\", \"qwerty12345\", \"admin\", \"12345\", \"team\".\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nUse a different password for each service. That way, even if one of your accounts is stolen, the rest won't go with it.\n\nPassphrases might be more secure when unexpected words are used. Even if you are resort to common words, you can arrange them in an unusual order and make sure they are unrelated.\n\nIt's better not to use passwords that can be easily guessed from your personal information, such as birthdays, names of family members, pets, or your own name. These are often the first guesses an attacker will try.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to memorise long and unique passwords for all the services you use, but with a special solution, such as Kaspersky password manager (http://apo-opa.co/3XuZDlm), you can memorise just one master password.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA). While not directly related to password strength, enabling 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone discovers your password, they would still need a second form of verification to access your account. Modern password managers (http://apo-opa.co/3XuZDlm) store 2FA keys and secure them with the latest encryption algorithms.\n\nUsing a reliable security solution such as Kaspersky Premium (http://apo-opa.co/4cbAC3o) will enhance your protection. It monitors the Internet and Dark Web and warns if your passwords need to be changed.\n\nAbout Kaspersky:\n\nKaspersky is a global cybersecurity and digital privacy company founded in 1997.

(Eugene Kaspersky via Flickr)\n\nSecurity giant Kaspersky is reportedly going to face a ban in the U.S. on sales of its software products.\n\nA report from Reuters cites sources familiar in reporting that the Biden administration is set to introduce new measures that would bar the import and sales of both Kaspersky-branded software and \"white label\" products that use Kaspersky software under a different brand name.\n\nIf announced in the coming days, the ban would take effect at the end of September, or 100 days after formal filing.\n\nAs of the time of publication, the White House had yet to issue any formal statement on the matter. Kaspersky did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe U.S. government already issued major sanctions on Kaspersky software products, barring federal agencies and contractors from purchasing and deploying its antivirus and security software in 2017.\n\nThe row stems from espionage fears related to the rising tensions between the U.S. and Russia. Though Kaspersky operates as an international organization with home offices in the UK and U.S., the company has its roots in Moscow and founder Eugene Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government.\n\nThis has led some within the U.S. government to worry that Kaspersky software could be deployed with back doors or other monitoring tools that would potentially allow Kremlin hackers to pull data from systems in other countries.\n\nKaspersky has long denied any ties to the Russian government or cooperation with any Kremlin espionage efforts.\n\nThe announcement comes as tensions between the two nations are heating up due to matters that have nothing to do with the information security or enterprise technology network. This week, Russia and North Korea held a summit that resulted in a mutual defense treaty. Russia thumbed its nose at the U.S. earlier in June by steering a small fleet of navy vessels off the coast of Florida.\n\nWhile a sales ban in the U.S. would be a significant blow to Kaspersky's bottom line, it would likely be one the company could survive.\n\nIn addition to continuing to sell its software outside of the U.S., Kaspersky maintains extensive consultancy and security research services that, as of now, would not be subject to any of the current or proposed sanctions and sales bans.\n\nThose operations are said to make up a significant portion of the company's revenues and, while they would likely not make up the loss in U.S. sales, would still maintain Kaspersky's status as a major player in the security market.", "source": {"uri": "scmagazine.com", "dataType": "news",

Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any U.S.-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational. Kaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nPressure on the company's U.S. business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action.\n\nKaspersky, which has a U.K. holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.", "source": {"uri": "cnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

And that's why we are compelled to take the action that we're taking today,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a call with reporters.\n\nNews of the ban was first reported by Reuters ahead of the announcement. A Kaspersky spokesperson did not immediately respond to TechCrunch's request for comment.\n\nKaspersky will be banned from selling its software to American consumers and businesses starting on July 20, but the company will be able to provide software and security updates to existing customers until September 29. After that, Kaspersky will no longer be permitted to push software updates to U.S. customers, according to Raimondo.\n\n\"That means your software and services will degrade. That's why I strongly recommend that you immediately find an alternative to Kaspersky,\" Raimondo said.\n\nRaimondo said that U.S. consumers who already use Kaspersky's antivirus are not violating the law.\n\n\"U.S. individuals and businesses that continue to use or have existing Kaspersky products and services are not in violation of the law, you have done nothing wrong and you are not subject to any criminal or civil penalties,\" said Raimondo. \"However, I would encourage you in the strongest possible terms, to immediately stop using that software and switch to an alternative in order to protect yourself and your data and your family.\"\n\nTo inform consumers, Raimondo said the Department of Homeland Security and the Justice Department will work to notify U.S. consumers, and the U.S. government will set up a website, \"so people who are impacted can find the information they need to understand why we're doing what we're doing, and help them take next steps.\"\n\nA senior U.S. Commerce Department official said during the press call that federal cybersecurity agency CISA will do outreach to critical infrastructure organizations that use Kaspersky software in their operations to help them find alternatives. The official also said that they don't plan on naming any specific action by Kaspersky that led to today's decision. (The Commerce Department asked reporters not to name the official.)\n\nThe ban announced Thursday is the latest escalation in a long series of U.S. government actions against the Moscow-headquartered Kaspersky.\n\nIn September 2017, the Trump administration banned U.S. federal agencies from using Kaspersky software over fears that the company could be compelled to help Russian intelligence agencies. Earlier in the year, it was reported that Russian government hackers had stolen U.S. classified documents stored on an intelligence contractor's home computer because it was running Kaspersky's antivirus, marking the first known incident of espionage resulting from use of the company's software.\n\nThe decision to ban Kaspersky has been in the works since last year, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal in April 2023.\n\nAccording to Kaspersky, the company has more than 400 million individual customers, and over 240,000 corporate customers worldwide. The senior official declined to say how many U.S. customers Kaspersky has, but said there is a significant number, including critical infrastructure organizations, and state and local government

It follows a preexisting ban on Kaspersky offerings in U.S. government systems that was enacted in 2017 after officials said its software was used to steal classified NSA employee data via backdoor intercepts controlled by the Kremlin.\n\nOther restriction steps followed, including a related ban on Kaspersky products for use in U.S. government contracts and a later move from the Federal Communications Commission that added the company to its national security threat list in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Thursday move is a first-of-its-kind decision that prevents the American private sector from buying Kaspersky offerings altogether.\n\nThe ban was invoked through a Commerce Department authority enacted during the Trump administration that allows the agency to restrict certain IT or communications technology transactions. Two Russia-based Kaspersky entities and one company unit based in the United Kingdom are targeted by the Thursday move.\n\nThe firm is barred from entering into new agreements starting July 20. It has until Sept. 29 before it must cease rolling out new security updates to customers using its products, which include its flagship antivirus software. Kaspersky also runs its own threat intelligence service similar to products offered by U.S. providers like Microsoft, Google and CrowdStrike.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo urged U.S. customers \"in the strongest possible terms\" to cease using Kaspersky and seek alternate providers.\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and ... the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans, and that's why we are compelled to take the action that we're taking today,\" she said in a call with reporters previewing the announcement.\n\nThe U.S. determined the company has been a continued threat to national security interests but that the agency had been awaiting funding and resources to invoke the restriction only now, said a separate senior Commerce Department official who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules of the news conference.\n\nKaspersky has a \"significant number\" of American customers, said the official, who declined to provide an exact figure because the information is confidential. Over 400 million customers in some 200 nations and territories use Kaspersky services, according to the company's website.\n\nRussia's state-centered economy allows Moscow to steamroll contracts for military and intelligence operations. A leak last year revealed the intricacies of this relationship, showing a vast network of consultants working on behalf of the Kremlin, including prolific hacking group Sandworm.\n\n\"We generally know that the Russian government uses whatever resources available to perpetrate various malicious cyber activities,\" said the senior official. \"We do not name any particular actions in this final determination, but we certainly believe that it's more than just a theoretical threat that we described.\"\n\nKaspersky and Russia's embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment. The company has previously denied allegations of ties to the Kremlin. The U.S. isn't expecting retaliation from Russia at this time but is \"certainly on guard and prepared\" in the event of a response, the official said. Commerce has evidence Kaspersky is still pushing software updates to its U.S.-based products and will take civil or criminal action if it's found to be doing so once the September 29 deadline passes, they added.\n\nThe firm in 2017 launched a transparency initiative and soon after began porting much of its core infrastructure to locations outside Russia, though it still has data centers based in Moscow.\n\nThe company has mostly walked a fine line on Russia-U.S. cyber relations since the war in Ukraine broke out two years ago, though its eponymously named founder Eugene Kaspersky had previously argued it's been caught in the crossfire of U.S.-Russia tensions. The firm came under scrutiny from national security officials shortly after the war began amid concerns that Moscow could influence its software designs for spying purposes.\n\nThe company was involved in tensions between Russia and Apple last year when the nation's Federal Security Service accused the tech giant of aiding the U.S. in a mass espionage campaign against thousands of people based in the country -- including diplomats -- through the use of a backdoor planted in their iPhones.\n\nThe firm at the time assessed the infiltration began with a seemingly innocuous iMessage attachment that could bolt the spying malware onto targeted devices without any user interaction with the message.\n\nApple vehemently denied FSB's claims and has declined to provide Kaspersky with a bug bounty reward for finding the flaws in its software that allegedly enabled the hacking to occur. Kaspersky determined the hack was carried out by a nation-state group but said it doesn't have enough evidence for exact attribution.\n\nKaspersky has set off alarm bells in other Western governments, including the U.K., Lithuania, Germany and the Netherlands.", "source": {"uri": "nextgov.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nextgov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nAbout Kaspersky:\n\nKaspersky is a global cybersecurity and digital privacy company founded in 1997.

Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between US firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New US business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping US export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any US-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational. Kaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nPressure on the company's US business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The US government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action.\n\nKaspersky, which has a UK holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:", "source": {"uri": "kaspersky.africa-newsroom.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kaspersky.africa-newsroom.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "africa_newsroom@kaspersky.africa-newsroom.com", "name": "Africa Newsroom", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brute-force attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letter case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QWERTY"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://kaspersky.africa-newsroom.com/files/large/e64a47b7fe3adb5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

United States close to announcing ban of all sales of Kaspersky Lab's antivirus software in America\n\nThe Biden Administration is reportedly set to increase the pressure on Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, over its links to Russia.\n\nReuters, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported that the Biden Administration on Thursday will announce plans to bar the sale of Kaspersky Lab's antivirus software in the United States.\n\nThe move comes amid US concern about Kaspersky Lab's large customers in America, including critical infrastructure providers, as well as state and local governments.\n\nEntity list\n\nReuters reported that Kaspersky Lab's close ties to the Russian government were found to pose a critical risk, with the Reuters source adding that the software's privileged access to a computer's systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers, install malware or withhold critical updates.\n\nThe sweeping new rule will apparently utilise broad powers created by the Trump administration, and will be coupled with another move to add the company to a trade restriction list, according to two other people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe plan to add the cybersecurity company to the US entity list, which effectively bars a company's US suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales prohibition, have not been previously reported, Reuters noted.\n\nA spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined to comment, while Kaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment, Reuters reported.\n\nKaspersky for its part has always maintained that it is a private firm with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe firm has even previously offered its source code for inspection by the US government.\n\nAccording to the Reuters report however, the US ban shows the Biden administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software.\n\nThe move is also reportedly designed to keep squeezing Moscow and the Putin regime, amid its illegal war in Ukraine.\n\nNew tools\n\nAccording to Reuters, the move also shows the Biden administration is harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between US firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested, Reuters noted.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe US restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, would also ban downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, and would kick in on 29 September 2024, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives, Reuters reported.\n\nNew US business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nSales of white-labeled products - that integrate Kaspersky into software sold under a different brand name - will also be barred, the source told Reuters, noting that the Commerce Department will notify the companies before enforcing.\n\nAt the time of writing there has been little public response from Kaspersky Lab, or from its CEO and founder Eugene Kaspersky.\n\nKaspersky Lab\n\nKspersky Lab has been firmly in the crosshairs of Western security agencies and governments for the past seven years now.\n\nIn 2017 the Department of Homeland Security banned Kaspersky antivirus from US federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and warning that Russian law could allow Putin's intelligence agencies to compel assistance from Kaspersky.\n\nThe FBI also reportedly advised a wide range of private firms not to use Kaspersky's products and some US retailers, such as Best Buy, removed them from shelves.\n\nThe same year the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) also warned British government departments not to use antivirus products with links to Russia for systems related to national security and those which were \"critically important\".\n\nAnd then Russia's President Putin opted to illegally invade Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nReuters noted that this triggered the US government to privately warn some American companies that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm.\n\nIn May 2022 the Biden Administration elevated the priority of a national security probe into Kaspersky Lab, amidst heightened fears of cyber-attacks due to the conflict in the Ukraine.\n\nIn March 2022, following the Ukraine invasion, Germany's cyber-security authority, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), issued an official warning against using Kaspersky products due to threats made by Russia's President Vladimir Putin against the EU, NATO and Germany.\n\nRead also : US

The news agency spoke with a person familiar with the matter who said that an announcement will be made this Thursday due to concerns that the software is being used by critical infrastructure providers as well as state and local governments.\n\nThe US government is concerned that Kaspersky may have close ties with the Russian government which is currently waging a war against Ukraine which the US supports. The US government believes that Kaspersky software is a critical risk as it has privileged access to computer systems that could steal sensitive documents or even withhold important security updates leaving systems open to cyberattacks.\n\nThe report states that the restrictions on Kaspersky will ban downloads of software updates, resales, and licensing of the product. If the government goes ahead with the plan, the sanctions would kick in on September 29, 100 days after the publication. This delay should give businesses and other organizations time to find a replacement.\n\nThe ban will also affect white label products that integrate Kaspersky into software under a different name. Companies that will be affected will be notified so they can make plans.\n\nThe upcoming Kaspersky ban was decided upon following a national security probe into the software by the Commerce Department. A prohibition on Kaspersky software has been delayed due to a back and forth between the Commerce Department and Kaspersky over mitigating measures that the anti virus maker has proposed. Ultimately, the Commerce Department decided that no mitigating measures would be enough.\n\nThe Biden administration will ban Kaspersky using tools created by the Trump administration when it attempted to go after TikTok and WeChat. Those efforts were ultimately foiled by federal courts which halted the bans.\n\nSource: Reuters | Image via Depositphotos.com", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_hill@neowin.net", "name": "Paul Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer virus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions_during_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions during the Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WeChat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious_Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Malicious Software", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2024/06/1718895971_depositphotos_188585242_s_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-29", "textStart": 983, "textEnd": 995}], "sentiment": -0.2941176470588235, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The full ban will officially take effect September 29 to allow current customers to replace their antivirus software products.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the ban was the result of \"the Russian government's continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacities to influence Kaspersky's operations.\"\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and, even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans,\" Raimondo said. \"That's why we are compelled to take the action that we're taking today.\"\n\nCommerce used powers established under the previous White House administration to fully prohibit Kaspersky and its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies from conducting business in the U.S. A 2019 executive order allows the department to block financial transactions with information and communications technology and services providers subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary.\n\nThe department is also imposing export licensing restrictions on three Kaspersky business units, adding the company to a blacklist formally known as the Entity List and informally known as the \"death penalty.\"\n\nCommerce has considered broad actions against the Russian cybersecurity giant for years, as experts have said that potential enforcement actions could deal a fatal blow to Kaspersky's North American operations (see: How Much Damage Would US Action Against Kaspersky Inflict?). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a 2017 directive requiring federal agencies to uninstall Kaspersky's software after discovering alleged links to Russian intelligence services.\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security - the Commerce agency tasked with enforcing limits on exports and transactions with companies considered national security risks - said national security risks surrounding Kaspersky don't stem from whether its products are capable of identifying viruses and other malware, \"but whether they can be used strategically to cause harm to the United States.\"\n\nKaspersky has previously denied allegations of its close ties to Russian intelligence services. The company did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nRisks to the United States include using antivirus software to install malware, exploiting antivirus software's access to the computing kernel to exfiltrate data to Russia and withholding critical malware signature updates to sabotage the effectiveness of its malware detection.\n\nKaspersky proposed a number of mitigations to federal officials, but the Bureau of Industry and Security rejected them, writing that proposed changes to U.S. operations and staffing did \"little to address the risks associated with Russian government

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\n45% (87M) in less than 1 minute.\n\n14% (27M) - from 1 min to 1 hour.\n\n8% (15M) - from 1 hour to 1 day.\n\n6% (12M) - from 1 day to 1 month.\n\n4% (8M) - from 1 month to 1 year.\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nNames: \"ahmed\", \"nguyen\", \"kumar\", \"kevin\", \"daniel\".\n\nPopular words: \"forever\", \"love\", \"google\", \"hacker\", \"gamer\".\n\nStandard passwords: \"password\", \"qwerty12345\", \"admin\", \"12345\", \"team\".\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nUse a different password for each service. That way, even if one of your accounts is stolen, the rest won't go with it.\n\nPassphrases might be more secure when unexpected words are used. Even if you are resort to common words, you can arrange them in an unusual order and make sure they are unrelated.\n\nIt's better not to use passwords that can be easily guessed from your personal information, such as birthdays, names of family members, pets, or your own name. These are often the first guesses an attacker will try.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to memorise long and unique passwords for all the services you use, but with a special solution, such as Kaspersky password manager (http://apo-opa.co/3XuZDlm), you can memorise just one master password.\n\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA). While not directly related to password strength, enabling 2FA adds an extra layer of security. Even if someone discovers your password, they would still need a second form of verification to access your account. Modern password managers (http://apo-opa.co/3XuZDlm) store 2FA keys and secure them with the latest encryption algorithms.\n\nUsing a reliable security solution such as Kaspersky Premium (http://apo-opa.co/4cbAC3o) will enhance your protection. It monitors the Internet and Dark Web and warns if your passwords need to be changed.", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_okafor@naija247news.com", "name": "Peter Okafor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brute-force attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darknet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passphrase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passphrase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password strength"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QWERTY"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multi-factor authentication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Internet", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_7889.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 222, "textEnd": 229}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nIt also shows the Biden administration harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced.\n\nIt is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any U.S.-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational. Kaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks.\n\nPressure on the company's U.S. business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action.\n\nKaspersky, which has a U.K. holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio (PIA.MI)New Tab, opens new tab, Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE)New Tab, opens new tab retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its

With the convenience of digital platforms, people can easily settle their utility bills, credit card payments, and other financial obligations without leaving their homes.\n\nAdditionally, online shopping has become increasingly popular in the Philippines, with consumers purchasing everything from groceries to electronics via e-commerce websites and mobile apps. These activities, while convenient, also expose users to potential cyber threats such as phishing scams, fraudulent websites, and malware attacks.\n\nTo protect one's finances from cyber-attacks, Kaspersky advises the public to adopt several crucial cybersecurity measures. First, it is essential to use strong, unique passwords for all your online accounts and to change them regularly. Utilizing a password manager can help you keep track of these passwords securely.\n\nMoreover, installing reliable anti-virus software on all your devices is a critical step in defending against malware and other cyber threats. Kaspersky also recommends practicing safe browsing habits, such as avoiding clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. Keeping your software and operating systems up-to-date is equally important, as updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities.\n\nJust recently, Kaspersky Next was launched in the Philippines.

According to the research results (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk), 45% of all analysed passwords (87M) could be guessed by scammers within a minute. Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nAbout Kaspersky:\n\nKaspersky is a global cybersecurity and digital privacy company founded in 1997.

The move under the agency's information and communications technology supply chain regulations prohibits Kaspersky from selling its antivirus software to U.S. consumers and even updating that product.\n\nIn a call with reporters ahead of Thursday's announcement, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move to ban Kaspersky was prompted by an extensive review of the company, its ties to the Russian government and the possibility that the Kremlin could lean on the firm to supply data on U.S. customers or be used in cyberoperations.\n\n\"Russia has shown time and again they have the capability and intent to exploit Russian companies, like Kaspersky Lab, to collect and weaponize sensitive U.S. information, and we will continue to use every tool at our disposal to safeguard U.S. national security and the American people,\" Raimondo added in a statement.\n\nRaimondo said the U.S. government will launch an awareness campaign to educate U.S. consumers of Kaspersky software about the threat it poses but that they would not be subject to criminal or civil penalties for using the tool. \"I would encourage you in the strongest possible terms to stop using that software,\" Raimondo told reporters.\n\nIn addition to the ban on the sale and updating of Kaspersky software, the Commerce Department will also add three Kaspersky entities to the department's entity list, which sharply limits the ability of U.S. companies to carry out transactions with the corporate entities in question.\n\nA senior Commerce Department official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the U.S. government's review of Kaspersky's presence in the United States had revealed that critical infrastructure operators and local governments are among the company's American clients, prompting alarm that the software could be used in attacks against them.\n\nThe notion that Kaspersky products would be used in operations against the U.S. government has been cited as a theoretical threat for years, and in 2017 Washington banned federal agencies from using its products. On Thursday, the Commerce Department official would not cite any specific examples of how Moscow might use the company as part of its intelligence or cyber operations but said \"we believe that it is more than just a theoretical threat.\"\n\nBanning the sale and even updating of Kaspersky's products creates a headache for its existing U.S. customers. The ban on product updates -- which will go into effect on Sept. 29 -- will mean that Kaspersky customers in the United States will find the company's anti-virus tool to be less effective as time goes by, a consideration that Commerce Department officials said will inform the U.S. government's messaging campaign.", "source": {"uri": "cyberscoop.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CyberScoop"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elias_groll@cyberscoop.com", "name": "Elias Groll", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Raimondo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gina Raimondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberwarfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information and communications technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Technology_Vendors", "label": "dmoz/Business/E-Commerce/Technology Vendors", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://cyberscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/GettyImages-1238831067.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-29", "textStart": 3068, "textEnd": 3076}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Such a move could mean a massive hit to the company's reputation and international sales, the sources said.\n\nThe restrictions will reportedly come into effect on September 29, giving the businesses 100 days to find alternatives. Downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product will also be barred. Kaspersky Labs will be banned in the US 30 days after the announcement of the restrictions. The Commerce Department will notify the companies before taking enforcement action against them.\n\nIf the department only adds the Russian entity to its trade restriction list, the damage will be largely reputational, Reuters said. If foreign units are added, the move could significantly hamper the cybersecurity company's supply chain, it said.\n\nSellers and resellers who violate the restrictions will face fines, with potential criminal cases being brought by the Justice Department in the event of willful violations. Software users will not face any legal penalty but are advised to stop using it.\n\nIn 2017, the US Department of Homeland Security banned all federal agencies from using Kaspersky software, citing national security concerns but providing no evidence. Company founder and Chief Executive Eugene Kaspersky denounced the move as \"baseless paranoia at best\" at the time, with the company filing a lawsuit, which was later dismissed by the court.\n\nAccording to Reuters' sources, there was a \"significant back and forth\" with Kaspersky before the ban, which proposed mitigating measures instead of an outright ban.\n\nFounded in 1997, the cybersecurity and anti-virus provider Kaspersky is headquartered in Moscow and operated by a holding company in the UK.

However, cybercriminals are seizing this opportunity to exploit one of the most anticipated events of the year. Kaspersky experts have discovered numerous scams designed to steal users' data and money, all disguised as UEFA 2024-related offers.\n\nFake tickets\n\nA traditional threat on the eve of any major offline event is ticket fraud, and this championship is no exception. Kaspersky experts have discovered, for example, a fraudulent page masquerading as a popular German energy company, offering a giveaway tickets to EURO 2024. Upon proceeding, users are prompted to fill out a form with their name, phone number, and address. This campaign is highly targeted, aiming at the victim company's employees and partners, meaning fraudsters will take every advantage to infiltrate the target's infrastructure.\n\nFake streams\n\nOnline viewers should also remain vigilant, as Kaspersky experts have discovered fake streaming platforms offering exclusive event coverage at low prices. Besides leaking payment and personal data, these sites may have built-in XSS vulnerabilities that enable attackers to control your browser.\n\nFake merch stores\n\nExperts also found fraudulent online stores selling fan paraphernalia: uniforms, scarves, hats and anything else with a 40% discount. Needless to say, those who got lured never received the chosen items.\n\nCrypto fraud\n\nScammers are capitalizing on EURO 2024's popularity even by selling customized coins featuring popular players, promising impressive returns. For instance, Kaspersky experts discovered a scheme involving coins named after Harry Kane. These coins are heavily promoted by fraudsters through email blasts and social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Telegram. Eager traders, not wanting to miss out, rush to buy the coins, driving up their price. Once the price is inflated, the scammers sell their holdings, causing the coin's value to crash within minutes.\n\n\"These schemes around major events follow a familiar pattern -- fraudsters simply change the lure based on current trends. However, we should not underestimate them, as they constantly adapt and find new ways to profit. For example, our recent discovery of cryptocurrency scams tied to popular players shows their ability to exploit emerging opportunities,\" comments Olga Svistunova, security expert at Kaspersky.\n\nTo stay safe from scams, Kaspersky experts share these tips:\n\nVerify Authenticity: Only purchase tickets, merchandise, or services from official and reputable sources. Check the event's official website for authorized sellers. Be Skeptical of Deals: If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be cautious of deep discounts and exclusive deals, especially if they come from unknown sources. Secure Your Data: Avoid sharing personal and financial information on unfamiliar websites. Ensure the website is secure by looking for \"https\" in the URL and a padlock symbol in the browser bar. Use Security Software: Keep your antivirus and security software up to date to protect against malware and phishing attacks. For example, Kaspersky Premium protects its users from phishing and scams. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about common scam tactics and how to recognize them. Follow updates from cybersecurity experts and official sources.\n\nLearn more about how to stay safe while enjoying the 2024 European Championship at Kaspersky Daily website.\n\n-Ends-\n\nAbout Kaspersky\n\nKaspersky is a global cybersecurity and digital privacy company founded in 1997.

The plan to add the cybersecurity company to the entity list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales prohibition, have not been previously reported.\n\nA spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined to comment, while Kaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government. The moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia.\n\nRead more: https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-ban-us-sales-kaspersky-software-over-ties-russia-source-says-2024-06-20/", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Critical infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Calculators", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 76, "textEnd": 83}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 17, "textEnd": 24}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Only 23% (44M) of combinations turned out to be resistant enough - cracking them would take more than a year. Furthermore, Kaspersky experts have revealed which character combinations were most commonly used in passwords.\n\nKaspersky telemetry indicates more than 32 million attempts to attack users with password stealers in 2023. These numbers show the importance of digital hygiene and timely password policies.\n\nThe results of the Kaspersky study demonstrate that the majority of the reviewed passwords were not strong enough and could be easily compromised by using smart guessing algorithms. Here is the breakdown of how fast it can happen:\n\nExperts identified only 23% (44M) of passwords as resistant - compromising them would take more than 1 year.\n\nFurthermore, the majority of the examined passwords (57%) contain a word from the dictionary, which significantly reduces the passwords' strength. Among the most popular vocabulary sequences, several groups can be distinguished:\n\nThe analysis showed that only 19% of all passwords contain signs of a strong combination - a non-dictionary word, lowercase and uppercase letters, as well as numbers and symbols. At the same time, the study revealed that 39% of such passwords could also be guessed using smart algorithms in less than an hour.\n\nThe interesting thing is that attackers do not require deep knowledge or expensive equipment to crack passwords. For example, a powerful laptop processor will be able to find the correct combination for a password of 8 lowercase letters or digits using brute force in just 7 minutes. Modern video cards will cope with the same task in 17 seconds. In addition, smart algorithms for guessing passwords consider character replacements (\"e\" with \"3\", \"1\" with \"!\" or \"a\" with \"@\") and popular sequences (\"qwerty\", \"12345\", \"asdfg\").\n\n\"Unconsciously, human beings create 'human' passwords - containing the words from dictionary in their native languages, featuring names and numbers. Even seemingly strong combinations are rarely completely random, so they can be guessed by algorithms. Given that, the most dependable solution is to generate a completely random password using modern and reliable password managers. Such apps as Kaspersky Password Manager can securely store large volumes of data, providing comprehensive and robust protection for user information,\" commented Yuliya Novikova, Head of Digital Footprint Intelligence at Kaspersky.\n\nIn order to strengthen passwords, users can follow these simple tips:\n\nAlso read: https://brandspurng.com/2024/06/20/tapswap-announces-the-suspension-of-token-allocation/\n\nAdditional information can be found in the research material on Securelist (http://apo-opa.co/3Rzi5pj) and Kaspersky Daily post (http://apo-opa.co/4cbmMOk).", "source": {"uri": "brandspurng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brand Spur"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brute-force attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Letter case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWERTY", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QWERTY"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Authentication", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cryptography", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/brandspurng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screenshot_20240620-1654252.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

This move, supported by powers established during the Trump administration, also involves placing Kaspersky on a trade restriction list, which would hinder its U.S. suppliers from conducting business with the firm. This dual action aims to mitigate potential threats of cyberattacks and espionage, especially in light of Russia's ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\n\nNo official comments: The Department of Commerce has declined to comment, while Kaspersky and the Russian Embassy have not responded. Kaspersky has previously asserted its independence from the Russian government, according to a report by Reuter. The planned restrictions underscore the U.S. effort to prevent cyber vulnerabilities from foreign adversaries like Russia and China. The tools being used for this ban are relatively new and were initially tested under the Trump administration against Chinese companies like TikTok and WeChat, though those efforts were blocked by federal courts.\n\nThe new rules, effective from September 29, will halt all new Kaspersky sales, updates, and resales in the U.S., with white-labeled products also being barred. The Commerce Department will inform companies prior to enforcement. The impact on Kaspersky's international operations remains uncertain, depending on whether its foreign units are added to the entity list, which could disrupt its supply chain. Kaspersky's business has been under scrutiny since 2017, when the Department of Homeland Security banned its products from federal networks over alleged ties to Russian intelligence. The scrutiny intensified following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nDespite Kaspersky's suggestion of mitigating measures, the Commerce Department has deemed the risks too significant to overlook.

The ban -- the first such action under authorities given to the Commerce Department in 2019 -- follows years of warnings from the US intelligence community about Kaspersky being a national security threat because Moscow could allegedly commandeer its all-seeing antivirus software to spy on its customers.\n\n\"When you think about national security, you may think about guns and tanks and missiles,\" Commerce secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters during a briefing Thursday. \"But the truth is, increasingly, it's about technology, and it's about dual-use technology, and it's about data.\"\n\nThe US conducted an \"extremely thorough\" investigation of Kaspersky and explored \"every option\" to mitigate its risks, Raimondo said, but officials settled on a full ban \"given the Russian government's continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacity to influence Kasersky's operations.\"\n\nThe Kaspersky ban represents the latest rift in relations between the US and Russia as the latter country remains locked in a brutal war with Ukraine and takes other steps to threaten Western democracies, including testing a nuclear-powered anti-satellite weapon and forming a strategic alliance with North Korea. But the ban could also immediately complicate business operations for American companies using Kaspersky software, which will lose up-to-date antivirus definitions critical for blocking malware in only three months.\n\nThe Biden administration knows roughly how many customers Kaspersky has in the US, but government lawyers have determined that this information is proprietary business data and cannot be published, according to a Commerce Department official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. The official did say the \"significant number\" of US customers includes state and local governments and organizations that supply critical infrastructure such as telecommunications, power, and health care.\n\nRaimondo had a message for Kaspersky's US customers on Thursday: \"You have done nothing wrong, and you are not subject to any criminal or civil penalties. However, I would encourage you, in as strong as possible terms, to immediately stop using that software and switch to an alternative in order to protect yourself and your data and your family.\"\n\nCommerce will work with the departments of Homeland Security and Justice to \"get this message out\" and \"ensure a smooth transition,\" including through a website explaining the ban, Raimondo said. \"We certainly don't want to disrupt the business or families of any Americans.\"\n\nDHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency will contact critical infrastructure organizations that use Kaspersky to brief them on the alleged national security risks and \"help them identify alternatives,\" the Commerce Department official said.\n\nKaspersky has consistently denied being a national security risk or an agent of the Kremlin. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the new nationwide ban. But given Kaspersky's past resort to litigation to defend itself, Thursday's announcement could prompt another lawsuit that sets up a high-stakes legal test of Commerce's national security powers.",

This new rule also aims to restrict Kaspersky's access to the US market, affecting its reputation and international sales.\n\nThe Biden administration on Thursday will announce plans to bar the sale of Kaspersky Lab's antivirus software in the United States, a person familiar with the matter said, citing the firm's large U.S. customers including critical infrastructure providers and state and local governments.\n\nThe company's close ties to the Russian government were found to pose a critical risk, the person said, adding that the software's privileged access to a computer's systems could allow it to steal sensitive information from American computers, install malware or withhold critical updates. The sweeping new rule, using broad powers created by the Trump administration, will be coupled with another move to add the company to a trade restriction list, according to two other people familiar with the matter, dealing a blow to the firm's reputation that could hammer its overseas sales.\n\nThe plan to add the cybersecurity company to the entity list, which effectively bars a company's U.S. suppliers from selling to it, and the timing and details of the software sales curb, have not been previously reported. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined to comment, while Kaspersky Lab and the Russian Embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Previously, Kaspersky has said that it is a privately managed company with no ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe moves show the administration is trying to stamp out any risks of Russian cyberattacks stemming from Kaspersky software and keep squeezing Moscow as its war effort in Ukraine has regained momentum and as the United States has run low on fresh sanctions it can impose on Russia. It also shows the Biden administration harnessing a powerful new authority that allows it to ban or restrict transactions between U.S. firms and internet, telecom and tech companies from \"foreign adversary\" nations like Russia and China.\n\nThe tools are largely untested. Former President Donald Trump used them to try to bar Americans from using Chinese social media platforms TikTok and WeChat, but federal courts halted the moves.\n\nThe new restrictions on inbound sales of Kaspersky software, which will also bar downloads of software updates, resales and licensing of the product, kick in on Sept. 29, 100 days after publication, to give businesses time to find alternatives. New U.S. business for Kaspersky will be blocked 30 days after the restrictions are announced. It is less clear what impact the entity listing will have on Kaspersky, whose Russian business is already subject to sweeping U.S. export restrictions over Ukraine which make it almost impossible for any U.S.-made items other than food or medical equipment to reach Russia.\n\nIf the Commerce Department adds foreign units of Kaspersky to the entity list that purchase significant inputs from the United States, the move could crimp its supply chain. If it only adds the Russian entity, the impact will be largely reputational. Kaspersky has long been in regulators' crosshairs. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Security banned its flagship antivirus product from federal networks, alleging ties to Russian intelligence and noting Russian law lets intelligence agencies compel assistance from Kaspersky and intercept communications using Russian networks. Pressure on the company's U.S. business grew after Moscow's move against Kyiv; The U.S. government privately warned some American companies the day after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 that Moscow could manipulate software designed by Kaspersky to cause harm, Reuters reported.\n\nThe war also prompted the Commerce Department to ramp up the national security probe into the software, first reported by Reuters, that resulted in Thursday's action. Kaspersky, which has a U.K. holding company and operations in Massachusetts, said in a corporate profile that it generated revenue of $752 million in 2022 from more than 220,000 corporate clients in some 200 countries. Its website lists Italian vehicle maker Piaggio, Volkswagen's retail division in Spain and the Qatar Olympic Committee among its customers.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and

What we know so far.\n\nThis morning, Reuters reported that President Biden will ban the sale of Kaspersky software in the United States, representing another attack on the Russian economy as the country continues its war against Ukraine. Kaspersky is a Russian company that has been in operation since the early 1990s and is headquartered in Moscow. The company offers products ranging from antivirus protection to password management and endpoint security platforms. The White House is accusing the company of having close ties to the Kremlin, which they argue creates security concerns for users in the US. Similar arguments have been heard on Capitol Hill earlier this year as lawmakers rallied majorities in both chambers to ban TikTok.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the new rules restricting the sale of Kaspersky will go into effect in late September. However, until the White House announces the details of the ban, this timeline remains an estimate. Additionally, the article notes that if the Department of Commerce only sanctions the Russian company and not its US subsidiary, the damage will be mostly \"reputational\" as it will not affect the company's ability to operate in the US.\n\nYou might be interested in: CDK Global releases update on ransomware attack: What did they say about the cyberattack?\n\nIn 2016, the German news outlet Welt reported that sales in the US represented a fourth of all revenue generated by the company.

The full ban will officially take effect September 29 to allow current customers to replace their antivirus software products.\n\nCommerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the ban was the result of \"the Russian government's continued offensive cyber capabilities and capacities to influence Kaspersky's operations.\"\n\n\"Russia has shown it has the capacity and, even more than that, the intent to exploit Russian companies like Kaspersky to collect and weaponize the personal information of Americans,\" Raimondo said. \"That's why we are compelled to take the action that we're taking today.\"\n\nCommerce used powers established under the previous White House administration to fully prohibit Kaspersky and its affiliates, subsidiaries and parent companies from conducting business in the U.S. A 2019 executive order allows the department to block financial transactions with information and communications technology and services providers subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign adversary.\n\nThe department is also imposing export licensing restrictions on three Kaspersky business units, adding the company to a blacklist formally known as the Entity List and informally known as the \"death penalty.\"\n\nCommerce has considered broad actions against the Russian cybersecurity giant for years, as experts have said that potential enforcement actions could deal a fatal blow to Kaspersky's North American operations (see: How Much Damage Would US Action Against Kaspersky Inflict?). The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a 2017 directive requiring federal agencies to uninstall Kaspersky's software after discovering alleged links to Russian intelligence services.\n\nThe Bureau of Industry and Security - the Commerce agency tasked with enforcing limits on exports and transactions with companies considered national security risks - said national security risks surrounding Kaspersky don't stem from whether its products are capable of identifying viruses and other malware, \"but whether they can be used strategically to cause harm to the United States.\"\n\nRisks to the United States include using antivirus software to install malware, exploiting antivirus software's access to the computing kernel to exfiltrate data to Russia and withholding critical malware signature updates to sabotage the effectiveness of its malware detection.\n\nKaspersky proposed a number of mitigations to federal officials, but the Bureau of Industry and Security rejected them, writing that proposed changes to U.S. operations and staffing did \"little to address the risks associated with Russian government control and direction.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Kaspersky told Information Security Media Group the company \"believes that the Department of Commerce made its decision based on the present geopolitical climate and theoretical concerns, rather than on a comprehensive evaluation of the integrity of Kaspersky's products and services.\"\n\n\"Kaspersky does not engage in activities which threaten U.S. national security,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company \"intends to pursue all legally available options to preserve its current operations and relationships.\"", "source": {"uri": "healthcareinfosecurity.com",

Current users will still be able to download the software, resell it, and download new updates for 100 days, which Reuters says will give affected users and businesses time to find replacement software. Rebranded products that use Kaspersky's software will also be affected.\n\nCompanies that continue to sell Kaspersky's software in the US after the ban goes into effect could be subject to fines.\n\nThe ban follows a two-year national security probe of Kaspersky's antivirus software by the Department of Commerce. It's being implemented using authority that the government says it was given under a national defense authorization act signed during the Trump administration in 2018.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nThe ban is the culmination of long-running concern across multiple presidential administrations. Kaspersky's software was banned from systems at US government agencies following allegations of the company's links to Russian intelligence operations. A month after Russia began its invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, the US Federal Communications Commission went one step further, adding Kaspersky to a security threat list that included Chinese hardware makers Huawei and ZTE. Adding Kaspersky to that list didn't ban consumer sales, but it did prevent Kaspersky from receiving funding from the FCC.\n\nFor its part, Kaspersky and its representatives have always denied the US government's allegations. CEO Eugene Kaspersky called the 2017 reports \"BS brewed on [a] political agenda,\" and the company similarly accused the FCC in 2022 of making decisions \"on political grounds\" and \"not based on any technical assessment of Kaspersky products.\"", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_cunningham@arstechnica.com", "name": "Andrew Cunningham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspersky_Lab", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kaspersky Lab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Raimondo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gina Raimondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antivirus software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Russia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malware"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dual-use technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Kaspersky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eugene Kaspersky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZTE", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ZTE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Huawei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Products and Tools", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Accounting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Industry-Specific", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Retailers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kaspersky-760x380.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667800", "eventUri": "eng-9667800", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 456620780, "relevance": 2}

The authorities unlawfully ended the activists' peaceful protest against drilling in the Arctic with seizure of the ship and arrests of all 35 activists and crew members on board. The Arctic Sunrise is currently being towed away from the drilling site, to the mainland in Troms\u00f6, Northern Norway.\n\nEarly Thursday, activists on inflatable boats and kayaks entered the exclusion zone of Statoil's Korpfjell well, Norway's most northern oil drilling site to date, and attached a giant globe to the rig Songa Enabler. The globe carried written statements from people from all over the world, with a message to the Norwegian government to stop the oil drilling.\n\nThe activists halted the operation of the rig, and after several hours of demanding an end to the drilling in the Arctic, the Norwegian Coast Guard interfered with the peaceful protest.\n\nTruls Gulowsen, Head of Greenpeace Norway, said:\n\n\"The Norwegian coast guard doesn't have the right to board or remove our ship. Protest at sea is an internationally recognized lawful use of the sea, related to the freedom of navigation. We are taking action against Arctic drilling in an area where our rights to protest are protected under international law. The Norwegian government cannot unjustifiably interfere with that right.\"\n\n\"The Norwegian government seems more interested in protecting the reckless Arctic oil drilling operation carried out by state-owned Statoil, than listening to the concerns voiced by people from all over the world and protecting the right to protest against the opening of a new, aggressive oil frontier in the Arctic. This is a violation of Norway's duty under its own Constitution and its commitments under the Paris Agreement.\"\n\nGreenpeace has monitored Statoil's oil drilling program in the Barents Sea for the last month.This is a part of Greenpeace's global campaign to protect the climate and the Arctic. In Norway, Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth have challenged the licensing of these Arctic oil fields in court, and the climate lawsuit will be heard in the Oslo District Court in November. The organization invites activists from all over the world to sign the People's Witness Statement, that will be presented to the court.\n\n356,000 people have joined the call to the the Norwegian government to respect the Norwegian Constitution and The Paris Agreement.\n\nProtest at sea is an internationally recognized lawful use of the sea related to the freedom of navigation. This freedom exists within the Extended Continental Shelf under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Article 87.\n\nIn exploiting the non-living resources in the extended continental shelf, Norway must not infringe or unjustifiably interfere with our freedom of navigation and our rights, including our right to protest (UNCLOS Articles 76, 78, 80).\n\nWhile Greenpeace recognizes that Norway has the right to establish a safety zone around a fixed offshore installation, there should also be room to exercise the right to protest in a safe and peaceful manner.\n\nImages can be found here.\n\nThe full collection from The People vs. Arctic Oil ship tour can be seen here.\n\nFor interviews with activists and spokespersons on board:\n\nPoul Bonke Justesen, communications lead, Greenpeace Nordic.

This is the first opening of new areas for oil drillings in 20 years and it is the northernmost area licensed by Norway.\n\nThe \"environmentally friendly\" Norwegian government granted new oil licenses, as part of the 23 license round, in the Arctic on the 10 June last year. Just ten days after, they ratified the Paris Agreement.\n\nGreenpeace US activist, Britt Baker, at the location said:\n\n\"As an American and global citizen, Trump's decision to retreat from the Paris climate agreement and boost fossil fuels at the expense of people around the world was devastating. Likewise, we see the Norwegian government opening new oil areas in the Arctic at full throttle, in spite of knowing the dangers it will have for future generations. The major difference between the situation in the U.S and Norway is that Trump left the Paris agreement with tunnel-vision motives to extend handouts to the flailing fossil fuel industry. Norway may as well have left the Paris agreement given the Norwegian's government desire to accelerate fossil fuel production. This government is showing the same disrespect to global climate commitments as Trump\".\n\nGreenpeace and its co-plaintiff Nature and Youth are taking the government to court in November, arguing that the new oil licenses are in breach of the Norwegian Constitution's right to a healthy environment (Article 112). Despite the ongoing legal case, Statoil is drilling several new oil wells in the Arctic this summer.\n\nGreenpeace Norway Arctic campaigner, Erlend Tellnes, from on board the Arctic Sunrise, said:\n\n\"Norway is not as green as their image. With one hand, the government have signed the Paris Agreement and profiled themselves as an environmental champion, whilst handing out hundreds of new oil blocks in the Arctic with the other. They ignore and disrespect environmental, scientific recommendations and have offered the oil industry licenses in some of the most pristine areas of the Arctic. Now they have to answer for their actions in court.\"\n\nWithin a month more than 150,000 people have joined the call to the Norwegian government to respect the Norwegian Constitution and The Paris Agreement, bringing the number to 355,000.\n\nFor interviews with activists and spokespersons on board:\n\nPoul Bonke Justesen, communications lead, Greenpeace Nordic.

The activists are there to deliver this message to the Norwegian government from around the world: Put People over Arctic Oil. They are also displaying a constructed giant globe in front of the rig with written statements to the government.\n\n35 activists from 25 countries are escalating a peaceful protest after tailing the rig for one month in the Barents Sea.\n\nThe Norwegian government has opened up for a new oil frontier in the Arctic. The state-owned oil company has just started to drill for oil at the Korpfjell well, a controversial site 415 kms from land. It is close to the ice edge and an important feeding areas for seabirds. This is the first opening of new areas for oil drillings in 20 years and it is the northernmost area licensed by Norway.\n\nThe \"environmentally friendly\" Norwegian government granted new oil licenses, as part of the 23rdlicense round, in the Arctic on the 10th June last year. Just ten days after, they ratified the Paris Agreement.\n\nGreenpeace US activist, Britt Baker, at the location said:\n\n\"As an American and global citizen, Trump's decision to retreat from the Paris climate agreement and boost fossil fuels at the expense of people around the world was devastating. Likewise, we see the Norwegian government opening new oil areas in the Arctic at full throttle, in spite of knowing the dangers it will have for future generations. The major difference between the situation in the U.S and Norway is that Trump left the Paris agreement with tunnel-vision motives to extend handouts to the flailing fossil fuel industry. Norway may as well have left the Paris agreement given the Norwegian's government desire to accelerate fossil fuel production. This government is showing the same disrespect to global climate commitments as Trump\".\n\nGreenpeace and its co-plaintiff Nature and Youth are taking the government to court in November, arguing that the new oil licenses are in breach of the Norwegian Constitution's right to a healthy environment (Article 112). Despite the ongoing legal case, Statoil is drilling several new oil wells in the Arctic this summer.\n\nGreenpeace Norway Arctic campaigner, Erlend Tellnes, from on board the Arctic Sunrise, said:\n\n\"Norway is not as green as their image.

They deployed a large model planet Earth and attached it to the oil rig's anchor chain. The globe carried written statements from people from all over the world, with a message to the Norwegian government to stop the oil drilling.\n\nTheir peaceful protest halted the operation of the oil rig for several hours.\n\nNorwegian authorities have just now arrested the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. The authorities unlawfully ended the activists' peaceful protest against drilling in the Arctic with seizure of the ship and arrests of all 35 activists and crew members on board. The Arctic Sunrise is currently being towed away from the drilling site, to the mainland in Troms\u00f6, Northern Norway.\n\nThis follows an admission by Statoil that it paid private investigators in New Zealand to surveil Greenpeace staff over several years.\n\nThe activity is part of a widespread Greenpeace campaign against state-owned Norwegian oil giant Statoil's oil exploration in the Arctic and in New Zealand waters. In 2016, the Norwegian Government granted new oil drilling licences in the Arctic.\n\nSullivan, who is Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu and Ngati Tuwharetoa, says she joined the protest on board the Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise, because climate change is a global issue.\n\n\"Both here in the Arctic and home in Aotearoa, Statoil are colluding with governments and are determined to suck out the last drops of oil, putting families, homes, and my people's way of life on the line,\" she says.\n\n\"Climate change is the biggest threat humanity faces and I can't stand idly by whilst governments and corporations like Statoil collude to disrupt democracy and push our planet over the edge.\n\n\"We're carrying messages from hundreds of thousands of people around the globe who are challenging Statoil's activity. It's the same back home in New Zealand, where thousands of Kiwis, including more than 80 hap\u016b and iwi, have come together to say \"no\" to deep sea oil.\"\n\nSullivan is the second Kiwi to join the ship in the Arctic on this trip. In July, New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless was also on board to confront Statoil.\n\nUp until recently, Statoil was also in New Zealand waters where it was prospecting for oil off the Wairarapa Coast using the world's largest seismic surveying ship, the Amazon Warrior.\n\nAt the time, Greenpeace New Zealand used the crowdfunded boat, Taitu, to confront the Amazon Warrior, 50 nautical miles at sea.\n\nThree swimmers, including Greenpeace New Zealand Executive Director, Dr Russel Norman, put themselves in the water in front of the 125-metre long ship, forcing it to change course and cease blasting for a day.\n\nBoth Greenpeace and the swimmers have been charged under the 'Anadarko Amendment' of the Crown Minerals Act. They will appear in Napier District Court on August 28.\n\nLast week, Greenpeace New Zealand launched legal action against controversial spy agency, Thompson & Clark Investigations, after an investigation revealed that oil companies, including Statoil, hired the agency to spy on Greenpeace staff and volunteers.\n\nThe information indicates that potentially hundreds of people had been watched, photographed and followed at work and at home on a daily basis, for several years.\n\nThe New Zealand Government has now also been implicated in the operation, and the Ministry of Business, Employment & Innovation (MBIE) admitted it received information from Thompson & Clark about Greenpeace while Statoil was using the Amazon Warrior to search for deep sea oil off the East Coast.",

The country has adopted legislation to become \"climate neutral\" by 2030 - far earlier than other countries. It's a frontrunner in electromobility - and will also ban the use of fossil fuels to heat homes from 2020.\n\nHowever, a new report from the Washington-based research organization Oil Change International is challenging Norway's reputation as a climate champion.\n\nThough it may be adopting laudable emissions reduction efforts domestically, it is exporting 10 times the amount of its domestic emissions to other countries though the extraction and export of North Sea oil and gas. It is the 6th largest gas producer in the world, and the 15th largest oil producer.\n\nGrowing oil exploration\n\nThe main thing worrying Friends of the Earth Norway, which sponsored the report, is that these exports are set to grow.\n\nNorway is issuing oil and gas exploration permits within its territories in the North Sea and the Arctic at a rapid pace. According to the report, these proposed and prospective new oil and gas fields would increase Norway's emissions by 150 percent from what it is today.\n\n\"Norway wants to be a climate leader - but every lease sale, every piece of new fossil fuel infrastructure, and every expansion into new carbon to be burned elsewhere says otherwise,\" Friends of the Earth's Silja Ask Lundberg told DW.\n\nThe report represents the first calculation of Norway's planned oil and gas extraction expansion, compared with the goals of the Paris climate agreement.\n\nThe research says 12 gigatonnes of carbon could be added by exploration sites in the Barents Sea and other parts of the Arctic over the next 50 years, and concludes that the plans are incompatible with the Paris goals to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe spotlight on oil policies in Norway comes at a strategic time, just one month before a general election that could bring in a new government there.\n\nThe report calls on the new government to freeze further leases or permits for new oil and gas extraction projects, or for transportation infrastructure that would incentivize further exploration.\n\nThe 'good producer'\n\nNorway has long insisted that continued extraction in its territories - particularly of gas - fits into a global emissions reduction strategy because Norwegian gas emits far less emissions than Middle Eastern oil.\n\n\"This report assumes that reduced production in Norway will lead to a fall in requests for oil and gas equal to what we produce,\" Tommy Hansen, director for industrial policy at the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, told DW.\n\nWith the association believing the amount of oil and gas that the market will demand will be in line with what the International Energy Agency is predicting, Hansen said the question is: Who's going to produce that oil and gas?\n\n\"We believe there are a number of reasons that Norway should be one of the countries to produce it.\"\n\nOne of the reasons is that gas, which makes up the bulk of Norway's fossil fuel exports, is a far cleaner fuel than oil or coal. Increased imports of Norwegian gas has enabled Norway's European neighbors to decrease their emissions by using less oil and coal - as has been the case with the United Kingdom.\n\n\"This spring, the UK will have a coal-free day for the first time since 1892 - and the reason they can do that is because of Norwegian gas, which has half the emissions of coal,\" said Hansen.\n\nThe other reason Norway believes it should continue producing is that it does so in what it says is the cleanest way possible, under strict restrictions not in place in other producing countries.\n\n\"The world needs energy - and Norway produces oil and gas resources very efficiently,\" Jens Fr\u00f8lich Holte, a political adviser to Norway's minister for climate and environment, told DW.\n\nHe points out that Norway is subject to the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme, and producers are thus subject to a CO2 price of about 50 euros. This incentivizes production to be very efficient, he explained.\n\n\"We have very strict regulations on emissions from oil production,\" he said. Of Norway's gas, 95 percent is exported to Europe - to \"countries that are subject to a very strict climate regime.\"\n\nHolte also said that Norway's long-term emission-reduction policies at home carry forward the shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nArctic invasions\n\nThe report counters this argument, asserting that Norway's continued extraction efforts are hurting the global effort to wean the world off of oil and gas.\n\nIt raises particular alarm about the country's plans for oil development in the Arctic. \"Much of this proposed development pushes further into the fragile and remote Arctic ... where a spill would be catastrophic,\" the report warns.\n\nLast year, Oslo issued 56 new licenses to allow 36 companies to explore near the Lofoten Islands - home of some of the world's richest cod stocks. Statoil, the national oil company, also plans to spend $6 billion developing the Castberg field, an stretch of Arctic ocean to the north of the country that could hold as much as 650 million barrels of oil equivalent.\n\nHowever much of this exploration is on hold pending the election on September 11 - particularly any extractive activity at the Lofoten Islands. So far, conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg has remained unconvinced by the argument that Norway should stop extraction. But green groups are hoping that a successor government might be more open to their message.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 37, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil_and_Gas", "wgt": 100, "id": 38, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Oil and Gas"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Fats_and_Oils", "wgt": 100, "id": 40, "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Fats and Oils"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Geology", "wgt": 100, "id": 90, "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Geology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Norway"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Norway"}, "type": "loc", "id": "167"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kingdom of Norway"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oslo"}, "type": "loc", "id": "152131"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302590", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum industry"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303064", "label": {"eng": "European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "303396", "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305534", "label": {"eng": "Carbon dioxide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306630", "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309738", "label": {"eng": "Global warming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309740", "label": {"eng": "Arctic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309998", "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North Sea"}, "type": "loc", "id": "314636"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "322585", "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statoil", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "325303", "label": {"eng": "Statoil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "326693", "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_platform", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328021", "label": {"eng": "Oil platform"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_the_Earth", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "342931", "label": {"eng": "Friends of the Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_cod", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "362507", "label": {"eng": "Atlantic cod"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sea_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "387898", "label": {"eng": "North Sea oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barents_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "420758", "label": {"eng": "Barents Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lofoten", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "519240", "label": {"eng": "Lofoten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_Society_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "1101894", "label": {"eng": "Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature"}}]}

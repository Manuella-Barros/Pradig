Michi no eki, or roadside stations, aren\u2019t always simply a place to stop and use the toilet on a long road trip. They can oftentimes boast stunning scenery, delicious food, and plenty of local souvenirs. There are so many unique roadside stations among the estimated 1,213 currently in service that there are quite a few michi no eki fanatics, including Su-zan and Danpei, who run the Japanese YouTube channel \u201cHaikei, Michi no Eki Kara\u201c. \u25bc Left: Su-zan; Right: Danpei Last year, they told us their top 10 most surprising roadside stations in all of Japan, but this time around, we asked them for their top five picks for newbies specific to the Kanto region\u2013Tokyo, Chiba, Saitama, Gunma, Tochigi, Ibaraki, and Kanagawa prefectures. So without further ado, here are their top picks, in no particular order: 1. Michi no Eki Takanezawa Genki Up-Mura (Tochigi Prefecture) Su-zan: \u201cThe main attraction of this michi no eki is the large onsen hot springs, but there are also stylish gelato shops and farmer\u2019s stands to browse. \u201cYou can enjoy Takanezawa Chanpon Noodles and even Okinawan cuisine, and you can stay overnight in nearby cottages.\u201d Danpei: \u201cThey have an impressive glamping site, and I was surprised at the RV park surrounding the large pond. Even if you don\u2019t decide to go glamping, you can still relax in the onsen. The vibes are great\u2013almost like a theme park.\u201d 2. Michi no eki Hanazono (Saitama Prefecture) Danpei: \u201cBoth the inside and outside are stylish and unique, so it stood out to me. The bakery, farmer\u2019s stands, and food court are tasteful.\u201d Su-zan: \u201cThere\u2019s a museum on the second floor where you can see Fukka-chan, Saitama\u2019s leek-inspired mascot, and they have goods like keychains and plushies for sale. Fukka-chan even shows up in person sometimes! If you\u2019re looking for a unique roadside station, I\u2019d recommend this one. 3. Michi no Eki Maebashi Akagi (Gunma Prefecture) Danpei: \u201cUnlike the quaintness of your typical michi no eki, this one has the spaciousness of an outlet mall. There\u2019s a huge variety in vendors: burgers, curry, udon, donburi rice bowls, desserts\u2026they even have a public bath, a fresh seafood market, an outdoor barbecue area, and more. It\u2019s a one-stop shop!\u201d Su-zan: \u201cIt\u2019s only ten minutes away from the nearest highway, so its convenient location makes it quite popular. There are always customers milling about.\u201d 4. Michi no Eki Joso (Ibaraki Prefecture) Su-zan: \u201cIt\u2019s not unusual to find local souvenirs and specialties at roadside stations, but Michi no Eki Joso takes it to the next level.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find all sorts of Ibaraki specialty-inspired goods featuring melons, sweet potatoes, and eggs. The product displays are always well-done, so even window shopping is fun.\u201d Danpei: \u201cThe food court has a variety of high-quality options like local meat, seafood donburi rice bowls, and ramen. It\u2019s right next to the highway, so it\u2019s super convenient.\u201d 5. Michi no Eki Hota Elementary School (Chiba Prefecture) Su-zan: \u201cThis is actually an abandoned elementary school that was converted into a roadside station. The main school building and gymnasium are now the food court and farmer\u2019s market, and they sell a lot of Japanese school-related merchandise. In the food court, you can enjoy local specialties and even Japanese kyushoku school lunch-inspired meals, which are actually super popular. They recently opened a Hota Kindergarten area where you can enjoy non-food-related activities. Danpei: \u201cThe school building also has accommodation-friendly facilities, so you can even stay overnight inside a Japanese school. It\u2019s a really exciting roadside station.\u201d There you have it\u2013five michi no eki that are unique and exciting enough to get you sucked into the world of Japanese roadside stations.

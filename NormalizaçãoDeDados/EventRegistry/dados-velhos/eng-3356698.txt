Twitter/@ChelseaFC\n\nWill Conte avoid second-season slump?\n\nJust three months after lifting the Premier League trophy, Chelsea manager Antonio Conte has described the new season as the most \"difficult\" test of his career.\n\nIn the past two seasons, Chelsea and Leicester City have both sacked their managers less than a year after winning the title.\n\nConte has spent over \u00a3100 million ($130 million, \u20ac110.8 million) on Alvaro Morata, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Antonio Rudiger to avoid becoming the third axed champion.\n\nCan Wenger salve old wounds?\n\nDespite ending last season on a high thanks to their FA Cup triumph against Chelsea, divisions still run deep at Arsenal over Arsene Wenger's lack of success in the Premier League and Europe over the last 13 years.\n\nOut of the Champions League for the first time in 20 years, Arsenal must make a fast start and avoid their usual winter swoon to keep the natives from becoming even more restless.\n\nHas Guardiola learnt English lessons?\n\nUnable to replicate his dominance with Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Pep Guardiola admitted his trophyless first season with Manchester City had been a learning experience.\n\nSpending over \u00a3200 million on six new players, including Tottenham Hotspur's Kyle Walker and Monaco duo Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva, puts Guardiola in position to mount a stronger challenge this time.\n\nJose Mourinho got 3/4 targets he wanted before the start of Premier League season, and is happy with current Manchester United squad. AP\n\nWill Mourinho deliver?\n\nJose Mourinho's first season at Manchester United was a qualified success, with a disappointing sixth-place finish in the Premier League offset by Europa League and League Cup silverware.\n\nNot content with that, Mourinho has spent over \u00a3140 million on Romelu Lukaku, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof in a bid to win United's first league title since 2013.\n\nCan Spurs make final step?\n\nTottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has assembled a side capable of holding their own against anyone, but for two years in a row they have fallen short in the title race.\n\nHaving finished seven points behind Chelsea, Spurs have yet to make a single signing, while Walker's sale to City and a season playing their home games at Wembley adds to Pochettino's problems.\n\nWill Liverpool click for Klopp?\n\nAfter a fourth-place finish last season, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp splashed out a club-record \u00a343.9 million on Roma winger Mohamed Salah, boosting a squad already brimming with potential.\n\nBut with Barcelona chasing star man Philippe Coutinho, winning Liverpool's first title since 1990 would be a remarkable achievement for Klopp.\n\nManchester United signed Romelu Lukaku for \u00a375 million. AP\n\nCan Lukaku justify his price-tag?\n\nSpurning interest from his former club Chelsea, Lukaku opted to join Manchester United in a \u00a375 million deal that was a record for a transfer between British clubs.\n\nLukaku has scored 85 Premier League goals in the past five seasons and the 24-year-old Belgian's ability to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be key to United's title aspirations.\n\nHow high can Everton go?\n\nEncouraged by Everton's seventh-place finish last season, manager Ronald Koeman has gone for broke in a bid to crack the top four.\n\nUsing the money from Lukaku's sale, he has brought former Toffees star Wayne Rooney back home, while spending over \u00a390 million on Davy Klaassen, Michael Keane and Jordan Pickford among others.\n\nFile photo of Alexandre Lacazette . AFP\n\nCan Lacazette carry Arsenal hopes?\n\nWith the future of unsettled Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez still up in the air, France striker Alexandre Lacazette arrives as the long-term face of Arsenal's attack after his club-record switch from Lyon.\n\nLacazette hit 37 goals in 45 games last season and Wenger desperately needs the 26-year-old to emulate that form.\n\nWhat next for Leicester?\n\nIt seems a lot longer than 15 months since Leicester City's fairytale title win in 2016.\n\nA dismal title defence and the shock sacking of Claudio Ranieri raised questions about the players' character, but a run to the Champions League quarter-finals under Craig Shakespeare augured well.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 12, 2017 05:22 pm | Updated Date: Aug 12, 2017 05:22 pm\n\nTags :#Alexandre lacazette#Antonio conte#Chelsea#Football#Kickingaround#Leicester city#Manchester city#Manchester united#Premier league#Romelu lukaku#Tottenham hotspur", "timeCrawl": "12:12:00", "sim": 0.729411780834198, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-12", "textStart": 4400, "freq": 2, "amb": false, "textEnd": 4412}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8788838", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Chelsea. Everton. Liverpool. Manchester City. Manchester United. Tottenham\n\nTonight, at the Emirates stadium, a new EPL season kicks off, exactly 83 days after Chelsea lifted the 2016/2017 Premier League title at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal will today host erstwhile champions, Leicester City in a first-of-its-kind Friday kick-off. Friday-night matches were introduced last season, but this will be the first campaign-opener not to be played on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe Premier League is so special because it is difficult to find any other league in the world where you will find a team, which is fighting a gruesome relegation battle on one hand and troubling the top teams on the other, consistently. There is also the lure of it being the richest league in the world and the enormous spending prowess of almost all football teams in English top flight. Last season, relegated club Sunderland earned 90 million pounds as part of the broadcasting rights, which was more than what Bayern Munich received for winning the Bundesliga title. It shows that even bottom-placed clubs are able to spend money on players which helps in reducing the gap between teams and in turn makes the competition a lot more intense.\n\nThe Premier League might not boast the mega stars of world football like Messi, Ronaldo, Bale and Neymar, but it can definitely boast of having the best coaches in the world with the likes of Jose Mourinho, Antonio Conte, Pep Guardiola, Arsene Wenger, Rafa Benitez, Jurgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino. These guys are proven achievers and will go to any level to see their side come out victorious. These are the few reasons why the upcoming season of the English Premier League could be one of the most thrilling seasons in recent memory.\n\nLeicester City's triumph two years ago has shown us that any team with the right personnel, management and good luck against injuries, can challenge for and win the title; however, for this season I believe that the winner will come from a group of seven teams which I will tag as the contenders. They are: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham.\n\nChelsea will find it difficult to successfully defend the title that Antonio Conte won by seven points in his debut season in England. They have a thin squad and there seems to be a bit of infighting between the Italian and the powers that be at the club, especially in the area of transfers. However, the champions won't let go of their title so easily and with new acquisitions like Alvaro Morata, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Anthony Rudigier to complement players like Eden Hazard, Cesc Fabregas and N'golo Kante, the pensioners will definitely not be written off.\n\nManchester City have doled out more than 200 million pounds on the likes of Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy, Bernardo Silva, Ederson, Danilo to strengthen their squad. It's obvious that Guardiola wasn't comfortable with his defence last season given that the majority of his acquisitions have been in that department. They have one of the best attacks in the league and the addition of Bernado Silva will only make them better. We definitely expect them to be better than last season and mount a serious challenge for the title.\n\nJose Mourinho didn't particularly have a very good debut season for United last term and the Portuguese has already spent over 100 million pounds to sign Romelu Lukaku, Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic, which means that he has gotten three of the four new signings he asked for at the end of last season. Mourinho has won league titles in the second season of every club that he has managed in the past, Porto (2004), Chelsea (2006), Inter (2010), Real Madrid (2012) and Chelsea (2015). He will be hoping to continue that trend with this Manchester United side.\n\nTottenham have not added to their team so far and that is largely due to the fact that Mauricio Pochettino has a well drilled squad at his disposal. He has arguably the best striker in the Premier league in Harry Kane, who scored 29 goals in the league last season, while Dele Alli, Heung-Min Son and Christian Eriksen added 40 goals (These four players scored more goals than the entire Manchester United team last season). They also have the best defence in the league, letting in only 26 goals last season and with one of the youngest teams in the league, we can only expect them to get better.\n\nArsenal have brought in Alexander Lacazette to bolster their frontline, but are still not certain if Alexis Sanchez will remain with them. They won't be playing in the Champions League for the first time in 20 years and that could help them in their quest for the league title this season. Arsene Wenger went through a lot of criticisms last season, before agreeing on a new two-year contract. This seems to be his last chance and the Frenchman will want to prove to doubters that he still knows how to challenge for and win the league title, even if he hasn't won it since their unbeaten season 13 years ago.\n\nLiverpool are in a serious battle to keep their best player as Barcelona have set their sights on the Brazilian to replace Neymar. He was very crucial to their Top Four finish last season, scoring 13 goals and dishing out 7 assists. A lot of people feel they aren't serious contenders because they do not have the 'big' names that can elevate them to that level. Jurgen Klopp has acquired the services of Mohammed Salah and Dominic Solanke and is still trying to add a defender and a midfielder to strengthen his team. You write them off at your own peril.\n\nEverton have completely changed the look of their team for this new season. The Toffees sold Romelu Lukaku for 75 million pounds to Manchester United and have invested the money wisely, bringing in Wayne Rooney, Michael Keane, Davy Klaassen, Jordan Pickford and Sandro Ramirez making them one of the teams to look out for this season. They are also keen on capturing Gylfi Sigurdsson from Swansea, they will definitely have a say in where the title ends up this season. This is one team we will be watching very closely this term.", "timeCrawl": "16:02:00", "sim": 0.7176470756530762, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8655127", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "id": 224, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

muscle in on the title race?\n\nLast season it was Chelsea who topped the tree in Antonio Conte's first campaign in charge, but this term promises to be the most competitive in many years. Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool have all added to their squads while Tottenham Hotspur can call upon England's in form striker in Harry Kane.\n\nThe battle to avoid the drop is also set to go to the wire, with newly promoted Huddersfield Town and Brighton and Hove Albion returning to the top flight after 45 and 34-year waits respectively. Newcastle United are the other 'new' face led by 2005 Champions League winning manager Rafael Benitez. There are three new managers, dozens of unfamiliar signings and even new rules accompanying the start of the 2016-17 season, which marks 25 years since the league was formed.\n\nAll that is left to do is for IBTimes UK's esteemed sports team to predict every outcome ahead of the new campaign. Just promise you will have forgotten it all by May 2018.\n\nChampions - Manchester City\n\nWith full-backs no longer an issue, Pep Guardiola will be able to implement all of his footballing ideals and propel City to the league title. Their summer transfer business, while remarkably expensive, has been necessary, with the prospect of more to come. Guardiola may have struggled to adapt last season, but the man is a serial title winner and seemingly has everything in place this time around.\n\nChampions League - Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal\n\nJose Mourinho now has the spine of his team in place and Romelu Lukaku's ability to ruthlessly destroy the teams they struggled against at home last season will be worth its weight in gold.\n\nChelsea's transfer activity has been far from spectacular, but the core of last season's title-winning squad is still there and in Antonio Conte they have arguably the best club manager in the world over the last five years.\n\nWhile doubts still persist over Alexis Sanchez's future, Arsenal and Arsene Wenger have a point to prove and seem to have enough strength in depth - and more importantly quality - to cope with the rigours of the Premier League and Europa League.\n\nRelegated - Brighton and Hove Albion, Burnley, Huddersfield\n\nThe two newly-promoted sides have recruited a number of players but still look some way off being able to mount a sustained fight against the drop, while teams seemingly found a way to get the better of Burnley at Turf Moor towards the end of the last campaign.\n\nSean Dyche's men did exceptionally well to stay up last season, but their over-reliance on home form, combined with the failure to replace the influential, imposing Michael Keane, could well seal their fate.\n\nTop scorer - Romelu Lukaku\n\nThe Belgium international scored 25 league goals last season in an Everton side that did not create an awful lot of chances and dropped off significantly during portions of the campaign.\n\nNow, with the likes of Pogba, Mata and Mkhitaryan providing the ammunition, Lukaku should finally be capable of beating Harry Kane to the Golden Boot.\n\nSigning of the summer - Dominic Solanke\n\nThe former Chelsea youngster is yet to experience any form of Premier League action, but his wondrous, productive performances in pre-season suggest that he is primed to hit the ground running at Liverpool.\n\nThe Reds will have to pay Chelsea a tribunal fee for Solanke due to his age, though the figure for one of England's brightest young talents will be miniscule when compared to some of the other amounts average players are going for.\n\nPhysically dominant and technically gifted, Solanke may not oust Roberto Firmino from his central striking position but he could be the difference between Liverpool reaching the top four or settling for the Europa League.\n\nFirst managerial departure - Mark Hughes\n\nThe Welshman failed to build upon Stoke's series of ninth-place finishes and unfortunately had the Potters mixing with the wrong company towards the back-end of last season. The squad is in dire need of refreshment but looks weaker than it was at the start of the previous campaign.\n\nWith nothing pointing towards a revival, Hughes could be looking for the seventh managerial job of his career very soon.\n\nGreatest hope\n\nThe title race is not done and dusted by early April as it has been in the last couple of seasons. Supporters have been starved of a proper battle for league glory for years now, with well-oiled but unspectacular units scooping the coveted prize in each of the past three seasons.\n\nThat is not to say the recent title winners do not deserve their success, but the campaign will be much more interesting if the destination of the title is not a foregone conclusion by mid-March.\n\nBiggest fear\n\nThe teams eighth and below remain primarily drab and dreary to watch. Apart from ninth-placed Bournemouth, the sides below Everton last season were either entirely forgettable or simply godawful.\n\nWhile most of the sides have it in them to defeat the fabled top six 'on their day', more is required from each and every one in order to make the Premier League a more intriguing spectacle.\n\nChampions - Manchester City\n\nGuardiola still needs a world class centre-back but City's strength in-depth is almost unmatched. The fact that players like Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Leroy San\u00e9, Danilo or Raheem Sterling do not even have an assured place in the starting eleven says it all. Furthermore, the former Barcelona boss already knows the Premier League better and will know how to make the most of his players to avoid another collapse.\n\nChampions League - Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool\n\nUnited only needs a marquee forward like Gareth Bale to be ready to fight for the title again. At the time of writing it looks like Chelsea will struggle to make even the top four but I still think Roman Abramovich will break the bank before 31 August to avoid repeating what happened during Jose Mourinho's last season at Stamford Bridge.\n\nMeanwhile, Liverpool's showing will largely depend on what happens with Barcelona target Philippe Coutinho but the signings of Mohamed Salah and Dominic Solanke should give them a boost to establish themselves in the top four.\n\nRelegated - Burnley, Huddesfield and Brighton\n\nSean Dyche has lost two key players in the form of Michael Keane and Andre Gray and has not signed anyone to fill the void.\n\nHuddersfield and Brighton's transfer activity have not been particularly promising either and suggests that the two newly promoted sides will not last long in the Premier League. Hull City and Middlesbrough's relegation should be a warning after they both dropped down only a year after their respective promotions.\n\nTop scorer - Harry Kane\n\nGabriel Jesus could be another candidate but considering that Sergio Aguero will also play a lot of minutes it seems logical to think that the Brazilian and the Argentinian will share the goals at City. Kane, however, will again be pivotal for Tottenham. Some predicted he would only be a one season wonder but he quickly proved himself to be one of the best number nines in the world.\n\nSigning of the summer - Mohamed Salah\n\nMohamed Salah's move from AS Roma to Liverpool for \u00a334m can be considered a real bargain in a market where footballers like Philippe Coutinho are valued in excess of \u00a3100m. In addition, his success at Anfield will serve to send a message to both Chelsea and the current United coach - Jose Mourinho - of the mistakes they made with him in the past.\n\nFirst managerial departure - Sean Dyche\n\nHe is the perfect fit for Burnley, there is little doubt about it. However, football is cruel and his current squad suggests that Burnley will have a terrible start to the season. Even Guardiola, Mourinho or Conte would struggle to keep this side in the Premier League. He should not be the one to blame but a manager is always easier to sack than 25 players.\n\nGreatest hope\n\nThere are some doubts regarding Alvaro Morata following his poor start to life at Stamford Bridge. However, I think he has all the ability to prove the doubters wrong and make a similar impact to the one performed by Fernando Torres during his early stint at Liverpool. If he scored 20 goals at Real Madrid as a fringe player he should exceed that tally at Chelsea with the support of Conte.\n\nBiggest fear\n\nSpurs have the best Premier League manager in Mauricio Pochettino. But the Argentine cannot perform a miracle every season. He will compete without major signings against other clubs that have invested more than \u00a3100m in new additions. Furthermore, the move from White Hart Lane to Wembley could be problematic.\n\nChampions - Manchester City\n\nWith almost \u00a3200m lavished on new recruits and further signings likely between now and the end of the transfer window, it is difficult to see City not claiming their first title since 2014 and a third in six years.\n\nPep Guardiola knows that last year's third-place finish was barely satisfactory and he should now be set to reap the benefits of another pre-season in charge. Competition will be fierce, but, as it stands, City appear the team to beat.\n\nChampions League - Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal\n\nDespite continued murmurings of discontent, it is hard to imagine a master motivator and disciplinarian of Antonio Conte's calibre allowing his side to slip any further than second provided they pad out a worryingly thin squad.\n\nManchester United will not be far behind in their second season under Jose Mourinho, while Arsenal, bolstered by the club-record addition of Alexandre Lacazette, should benefit from Liverpool's lack of depth and Tottenham's risky transfer strategy to make an immediate return to the top four.\n\nRelegated - Burnley, Huddersfield, Brighton\n\nYet to replace their standout performer in Michael Keane, Burnley look set to be deprived of their most influential attacker [Andre Gray] just days before the season opener. Any decline with regards to their formidable home form would likely prove fatal.\n\nBrighton's recruitment has been thoroughly underwhelming for the most part and it remains to be seen if Chris Hughton possesses the necessary tactical nous to succeed at this level.\n\nHuddersfield may benefit from an 'unknown factor' and in David Wagner boast an outstanding young manager. However, the German does not possess the requisite quality for survival and a strong team spirit is unlikely to be enough.\n\nTop scorer - Harry Kane\n\nKane was simply irresistible towards the end of the 2016-17 campaign, with his staggering eight strikes in the space of a week ensuring that he finished four clear of Romelu Lukaku and claimed a second consecutive Golden Boot award.\n\nIt was the third year in a row that the England striker had topped the 20-goal mark - quite an achievement when you consider that he missed almost three months with two separate ankle injuries. Those predicting an inevitable regression have been made to look very foolish indeed.\n\nSigning of the summer - Mohamed Salah\n\nEquipped with a burning desire to prove his worth in English football after a forgettable spell at Chelsea, Salah looks set to thrive in Jurgen Klopp's system at Liverpool that looks tailor-made for his talents.\n\nBlessed with searing pace, trickery and an eye for goal, the Egyptian winger resurrected his career in Serie A in scintillating fashion and should not be underestimated.\n\nThe dual counter-attacking threat of Salah and Sadio Mane will have full-backs the league over breaking out in a cold sweat. Whether it will be enough to help the Reds retain their grip on a top-four berth is another matter.\n\nFirst managerial sacking - Mark Hughes\n\nThe ongoing transfer friction at Newcastle may yet lead to a premature departure for Rafael Benitez, but it is difficult to avoid the feeling that Stoke are now stagnating under Hughes after initial signs of real progress.\n\nThe Welshman's run of three successive top-half finishes came to an end last term and a lacklustre window coupled with the departure of talisman Marko Arnautovic to West Ham United hardly bodes well for an immediate return. A fresh approach may be required in the Potteries.\n\nGreatest hope\n\nThat in a frankly bonkers transfer window dominated by ludicrous fees, several low-cost signings prove their worth and demonstrate that there is still value to be had even in this day and age.\n\nForget your Kyle Walkers, Romelu Lukakus and Alexandre Lacazettes, it is the likes of Sead Kolasinac, Will Hughes and Roque Mesa that will get my strongest backing out of the gate.\n\nBiggest fear\n\nGiven the surprising way in which their respective transfer sagas eventually unfolded, it seems inevitable that we will be treated to a degree of comparison between new Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku and Chelsea counterpart Alvaro Morata this season.\n\nHowever, what we could definitely do without is a never-ending stream of articles and tedious weekly debates over which club got the better deal. Judge them on their own merits, please.\n\nChampions - Manchester City\n\nPep Guardiola's side displayed signs of their capacity to be truly irresistible only in patches last season, but having filled the gaping holes in their squad - particularly in defence - they should be able to discover the consistency required to be champions. And with Gabriel Jesus, 20, Leroy Sane, 21, and Raheem Sterling, 22, they have an attacking trident which could dominate for a generation.\n\nChampions League - Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal\n\nAnother summer of spending will not be enough to deliver Jose Mourinho his fourth league title in England, but another campaign in Europe's premier club competition awaits.\n\nChelsea start the campaign with a deluge of problems, sparking suggestions their collapse from two years ago could be repeated. But Antonio Conte will work his squad to the bone and though the title may be relinquished a top four spot is more than achievable.\n\nAnd should Arsenal successfully stand in the way of Alexis Sanchez leaving the club then Arsene Wenger has the quality available - helped by the addition of Alexandre Lacazette - to ensure their absence from the Champions League is restricted to one season. Tottenham and Liverpool have not sufficiently strengthened.\n\nRelegated - Brighton and Hove Albion, Newcastle United, Watford\n\nChris Hughton may have reached his managerial peak in bringing Brighton to the top flight but his Premier League record is dreadfully poor and a summer of few recruits makes his task even harder.\n\nThere is palpable friction between Rafael Benitez and Mike Ashley and such a collision between manager and owner normally ends in the swift exit for the man at the helm. The new man will find a Newcastle squad which has not been sufficiently strengthened, with their attack being led by Dwight Gayle - which says it all.\n\nThough Marco Silva has credit in the bank from his brief spell with Hull City, he was unable to keep them from the drop. Watford have undergone another summer overhaul and with the fans disengaged, their slide down the division should see them fall through the trap door.\n\nTop scorer - Harry Kane\n\nNot since the 1996-97 season has a player won the Premier League golden boot in three successive seasons, but you would be hard pressed to back anyone other than Harry Kane taking that honour from Alan Shearer. And I doubt it will be the last time he eclipses the division's record goalscorer.\n\nSigning of the summer - Jordan Pickford\n\nPickford's status as the third most expensive goalkeeper might have been questionable but it is more than justifiable for the best English goalkeeper in the Premier League. Ronald Koeman has solved Everton's problem position and though it may have cost \u00a330m the 23-year-old is worth his weight in gold.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFirst managerial departure - Rafael Benitez\n\nAs previously mentioned, Benitez's growing frustration regarding his freedom in the transfer market at Newcastle can only lead to one thing. The Spaniard is a principled man and even if it takes a fee to release himself from his St James' Park he will do so if Ashley continues to restrict his influence.\n\nGreatest hope\n\nWith VAR in football's rear-view mirror, perhaps the only way of throwing a spanner in the works before the game becomes completely unrelatable is for goal-line technology to throw a wobbly. Granted, it may cost an owner some precious pounds - diddums - but it would assist in returning the sport to the people.\n\nBiggest fear\n\nThat with more coverage and interest on the transfer agenda of every club, analysis on every facet of the game, fees for players and agents reaching alarming levels while television viewing figures continue to cascade that this season sees the sport of football, simply, becomes completely irrelevant.\n\nChampions - Manchester City\n\nPep Guardiola has cleared out the 'past-its-sell-by-date' dross that occupied the Etihad Stadium last season and replaced it with quality that drastically improves their first-team - much of that in full-back roles, which are now so significant to success in the modern game. Pep's decision to focus on strengthening those positions will be vindicated next summer - that and the prospect of a fully fit Gabriel Jesus firing will be the catalysts to success.\n\nChampions League - Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United\n\nChelsea transitioning their game around Alvaro Morata will not be an overnight process, while Arsenal will feel the benefit of a lighter schedule just as the Blues did last season - albeit without the sparkling success at the end of it. While Romelu Lukaku will ably replicate the goal scoring feats of Zlatan last season, the rest of Jose Mourinho's attack still feels disparate and some way off that of their rivals.\n\nRelegated - Newcastle United, Burnley, Huddersfield Town\n\nRumblings of discontent between Rafa Benitez and the hierarchy at St James' Park are not going anywhere and will only grow louder - and it could cost them their Premier League status again. For all Sean Dyche's merits, not spending money remains a capital crime for a top flight club while Huddersfield simply do not seem equipped for a prolonged stay.\n\nTop scorer - Harry Kane\n\nAttempting to balance European and domestic matters will derail Tottenham's hopes of a league challenge - but that will not prevent Harry Kane from winning a third consecutive golden boot.\n\nSigning of the summer - Javier Hernandez\n\nWithout breaking off into a generic rant about how The Transfer Window Has Gone Mad\u2122, \u00a316m for the former Manchester United striker represents incredible value for money for a player who can guarantee goals.\n\nFirst managerial sacking - Mark Hughes\n\nStoke City have been going nowhere under the Welshman - not entirely his fault given the chasm between where they sit in mid-table and those challenging from Europe. But that understanding might not be shared in the Potters' boardroom.\n\nGreatest hope\n\nNathan Ake and more importantly Nathaniel Chalobah have stand-out campaigns for Bournemouth and Watford respectively and make a mockery of Chelsea's flawed youth model.\n\nBiggest fear\n\nThe futures of Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil remain unresolved and we are forced to entertain the dullest contract sagas of all time all over again - complete with Arsene Wenger's refusal to tell us anything whatsoever.", "timeCrawl": "14:03:00", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 5918, "date": "2017-08-31", "imp": true, "amb": false, "textEnd": 5927}, {"date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 1065, "amb": false, "textEnd": 1073}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8924184", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

weekend\n\nThe English Premier League is often billed as the best in the world. While that is up for debate, there is no question that it is the most competitive. As many as six big clubs will vie for the title this season and it promises to be a fight to the finish. We take a look at how things stand ahead of the opening weekend.\n\nChampion Chelsea has thus far failed to significantly enhance a squad that faces the twin rigours of a title defence and a Champions League campaign. Alvaro Morata has replaced the exiled Diego Costa, Tiemoue Bakayoko has come in for Nemanja Matic in midfield and Antonio Rudiger brings defensive cover, but it doesn't seem enough. Manager Antonio Conte says his main priority is to avoid what he saltily called \"the Mourinho season,\" a reference to the 10th-place finish that followed the 2015 win.\n\nStrengths\n\nConte's attention to detail and ability to implement tactical nuances in training are legendary. His players said these were qualities that decided the 2016-17 season, with Chelsea switching to the 3-4-3 and turning the campaign around after a hammering at Arsenal. There is much to be said for an organised defence, and Chelsea has that covered.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe side benefited hugely from a convenient schedule in 2016-17. Without the demands of European midweek action, the team could recover physically and strategise between Premier League games. This will change. Also, Eden Hazard's absence during the early part of the season and the lack of Costa's nasty sharp-shooting up front could make Chelsea susceptible to ambushes.\n\nWatch out for\n\nN'Golo Kante was the league's Player of the Season, but for Chelsea to have any chance of defending its title, it needs Hazard at his marauding, havoc-causing best.\n\nForecast\n\nAn encore of last season's heroics seems improbable. But never underestimate a Conte-coached team; his sides have a knack of finding a way over the course of the league.\n\nUnder Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham has established itself as a title contender despite not having the big clubs' purchasing power. The tactical nous of the Argentine manager, however, has failed to bring any silverware. Surprisingly, the club is yet to sign anyone this summer. Club chairman Daniel Levy may be quite right to label rival teams' summer spending as unsustainable, but Pochettino knows that the lack of squad depth will hurt the team's chances in the league and in Europe.\n\nStrengths\n\nTottenham has one of the most balanced and tactically flexible sides in the league and can switch its formation depending on the team it is facing. It not only has a wealth of attacking talent at its disposal - last season, it was the only team with three players (Harry Kane, Dele Alli, and Son Heung-min) who scored over 20 goals in all competitions - but also the stingiest defence in top flight.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nA penchant for slow starts. In 2015-16, in the first 16 matches, Spurs lost two and drew eight, dropping 22 of the 48 points at stake, while last season, in the opening 16 games, it lost twice and drew six times, dropping 18 points. Allowing its rivals such head-starts left Spurs too much to do later on. It will hope to fare better this year at Wembley, where it has won just two of its last 10 matches.\n\nWatch out for\n\nChristian Eriksen. The highly rated Danish playmaker can unlock defences with his accurate passing and awareness of space. He is also deadly on the ball, scoring screamers from outside the box and from set pieces.\n\nForecast\n\nWith both the Manchester clubs and Chelsea reinforcing their squads, Tottenham will do well to stay in mix for the title run-in and finish in the top four.\n\nEmpowered by a close-season transfer splurge of some \u00a3200 million, Manchester City is an early favourite to topple Chelsea. Pep Guardiola endured a bruising first season in English football as City failed to challenge, eventually finishing 15 points adrift in third place. The club reacted with a glut of new signings -- three new full-backs in Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo, plus goalkeeper Ederson and playmaker Bernardo Silva -- and now look a force to be reckoned with.\n\nStrengths\n\nCity can hurt teams in a variety of ways. It can unlock a deep block with quick passing and one-on-one specialists (Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling). And it can sting on the counter through its newly acquired athletic full-backs and pass-masters David Silva and Kevin de Bruyne. Add Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus, and you sense goals won't be a problem.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nWhile City shimmered in attack last season, it frequently appeared vulnerable in defence. Re-sculpting the back four has been Guardiola's main priority, but new defences take time settling; they need the pressure of matches to build the understanding needed. Besides, Guardiola teams often play out from the back, and the slightest lapse in concentration can be brutally punished in the English game.\n\nWatch out for\n\nGabriel Jesus. The Brazilian sensation has it all: he can link play, press from the front, beat his marker with skill, and shoot with hardly any back-lift.\n\nForecast\n\n\"I think Manchester City are the team to beat, the forward players they've got is scary,\" said Manchester United great Ryan Giggs in a column. It's hard to disagree.\n\nFourth last season, Liverpool's transfer spending hasn't made for screamer headlines. But winger Mohamed Salah, striker Dominic Solanke and left-back Andrew Robertson are smart buys that fit Jurgen Klopp's high-tempo pressing game. And both Salah and Robertson immediately improve the first XI. The Reds, looking for a first title in the Premier League era, will keep a wary eye on Merseyside rival Everton, whose ambitious summer window articulates a determination to crash the top six.\n\nStrengths\n\nAt its best, Liverpool is wonderfully disruptive, counter-pressing the opposition, winning the ball high up the pitch and quickly entering the penalty area. This style gives other attacking teams fits. A frontline of Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane is a frightening proposition to deal with; if Liverpool can keep them injury-free over the season, it will challenge for the title.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nLiverpool struggled last season when it dominated possession against deep-sitting teams. It relied too often on Philippe Coutinho's long-range shooting; against a listless Watford, only an Emre Can worldie won it a crucial three points. It remains to be seen if this has been addressed. The defence's tendency to switch off is a recurrent worry. Klopp sides also tend to fade late in the season.\n\nWatch out for\n\nSadio Mane's injury last season was a severe blow. Liverpool might need to wrap him in cotton wool, for he's perhaps the best pressing forward in the world game.\n\nForecast\n\nExpect Liverpool to do well against the rest of the big six. If it gets lucky - with injuries and 50-50 decisions - it might be able to stay in the title conversation.\n\nArsenal sensationally upstaged Chelsea in last season's FA Cup final and beat Conte's title-winners again in the Community Shield, but manager Arsene Wenger will continue to walk a tightrope. While Wenger has pulled off the big-name signing of Alexandre Lacazette and delivered three FA Cup titles (and three Community Shield wins) in the last four years, he has had to deal with a great degree of criticism from Gunner fans in this time. Dissent could swiftly return if results go awry.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe switch late last season to the 3-4-3 acted as a force-multiplier: it formed a three-chain at the back, offering greater security and an extra man in possession; the shape naturally created passing diamonds, something Arsenal's customarily freeform style benefited from; and it stationed Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez between the lines. As a result, the squad's ceiling significantly improved.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nArsenal tends to suffer every season from two things - a form slump and debilitating injuries to key players. As a consequence, the Gunners have rarely been able to put together a strong title challenge during the last decade. They've also struggled against overtly physical teams that play direct, cynical football although they've done better recently.\n\nWatch out for\n\nLacazette is the clinical finisher Arsenal has missed since Robin van Persie left. Olivier Giroud is an excellent Plan B, allowing the side different angles of attack.\n\nForecast\n\nArsenal looks a better knockout side than a league side - it can outplay anyone on its day, but can't sustain it over a season. It will need something special to change this.\n\nAsked about his plans after United won the Europa League in May, Jose Mourinho said, \"Ed Woodward has my wish list. It is for him to do the job.\" United's suits have granted three of Mourinho's four wishes, though Victor Lindelof, Romelu Lukaku, and Nemanja Matic might not necessarily have been his first choices for the positions. United is still in the market for a winger - Ivan Perisic's name is being bandied about - and should that come through, Mourinho might have a team to make a fist of it.\n\nStrengths\n\nHeight. United boasts of the second tallest team (on average height), up from seventh during Louis van Gaal's time. This fits in nicely with Mourinho's scheme of speedy wingers delivering pinpoint crosses to a tall target-man. While Lukaku's physical presence works here, United's dominance after Marouane Fellaini's introduction in the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid gives the coach options.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nProfligacy in front of goal. It was the bane in Mourinho's first season, and the Red Devils had to repeatedly fall back on ageing warhorse Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Lukaku for all his talent, and development at Everton, is no Ibra. And big-ticket signing Paul Pogba continues to underwhelm. This is where the addition of a goal-scoring winger in Perisic, or maybe even Gareth Bale, could unlock United's fortunes.\n\nWatch out for\n\nMarcus Rashford. The England youngster is far from a finished product, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Instead it means that he has room to develop, though it depends on his Portuguese gaffer giving him an extended run.\n\nForecast\n\nMourinho's teams usually hit top form in his second season.

While that is up for debate, there is no question that it is the most competitive. As many as six big clubs will vie for the title this season and it promises to be a fight to the finish. We take a look at how things stand ahead of the opening weekend\n\nCHELSEA\n\nChampion Chelsea has thus far failed to significantly enhance a squad that faces the twin rigours of a title defence and a Champions League campaign. Alvaro Morata has replaced the exiled Diego Costa, Tiemoue Bakayoko has come in for Nemanja Matic in midfield and Antonio Rudiger brings defensive cover, but it doesn't seem enough. Manager Antonio Conte says his main priority is to avoid what he saltily called \"the Mourinho season,\" a reference to the 10th-place finish that followed the 2015 win.\n\nStrengths\n\nConte's attention to detail and ability to implement tactical nuances in training are legendary. His players said these were qualities that decided the 2016-17 season, with Chelsea switching to the 3-4-3 and turning the campaign around after a hammering at Arsenal. There is much to be said for an organised defence, and Chelsea has that covered.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe side benefited hugely from a convenient schedule in 2016-17. Without the demands of European midweek action, the team could recover physically and strategise between Premier League games. This will change. Also, Eden Hazard's absence during the early part of the season and the lack of Costa's nasty sharp-shooting up front could make Chelsea susceptible to ambushes.\n\nWatch out for\n\nN'Golo Kante was the league's Player of the Season, but for Chelsea to have any chance of defending its title, it needs Hazard at his marauding, havoc-causing best.\n\nForecast\n\nAn encore of last season's heroics seems improbable. But never underestimate a Conte-coached team; his sides have a knack of finding a way over the course of the league.\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR\n\nUnder Mauricio Pochettino, Tottenham has established itself as a title contender despite not having the big clubs' purchasing power.

Taking advantage of astronomical broadcast contracts and lucrative sponsorship deals, England's superpowers have been splashing the cash at an unprecedented rate. Since the end of last season, transfer records have been shattered across the country as over one billion pounds has changed hands in a frenzy that could well set a new high for a single window.\n\nWhile some fear the spending is unsustainable and will put clubs' long-term stability at risk, the 25th year of the English Premier League era should deliver a title race more fiercely contested than ever.\n\nDesperate to dethrone champions Chelsea, club record fees have been paid by Manchester United, who splurged a British record \u00a375 million for Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, Arsenal, who forked out \u00a352 million on Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette and Liverpool, who put down \u00a337 million for Roma winger Mohamed Salah.\n\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola set the tone with a series of early deals that took his spending in this window to an eye-watering \u00a3218 million. Frustrated by City's failings in his trophyless first season in England, Guardiola has overhauled his squad with defenders Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo, plus goalkeeper Ederson and playmaker Bernardo Silva.\n\nGuardiola's old rival Jose Mourinho hasn't been shy about raiding the United coffers, with the Lukaku swoop headlining a \u00a3140 million spree that also brought Benfica defender Victor Lindelof and Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic to Old Trafford.\n\nMourinho won the league in his second seasons at Porto, Real Madrid and Inter Milan, as well as in both of his stints at Chelsea, but he expects this season's title race to be an almighty scrap.\n\n\"Normally the second season should be better than the first, but again, this is modern football. The reality is totally different,\" Mourinho said.\n\n\"It's getting much harder for everyone, so we don't know.\"\n\nThe no limits spending of Chelsea's title rivals prompted a tetchy response from Stamford Bridge, where boss Antonio Conte has been grumbling about his club's failure to land Lukaku and several other targets.\n\nEven so, Conte has done his best to get billionaire Blues owner Roman Abramovich to throw his financial muscle behind Chelsea's title defence.\n\nA club record \u00a358 million lured Real Madrid forward Alvaro Morata from the European champions, while Tiemoue Bakayoko and Antonio Rudiger also joined Chelsea, whose spending climbed over \u00a3130 million.\n\nFans got their first glimpse of how one of the contenders will fare when Arsenal, fresh from their Community Shield victory over Chelsea, faced Leicester in the season opener at the Emirates Stadium last night.\n\nArsene Wenger brokered a fragile truce with Arsenal's dissenting fans by winning the FA Cup last season, but the Gunners boss has no margin for error after going 13 years without Premier League glory.\n\nLast season was by far the most difficult of Wenger's 21-year reign, with Arsenal's on-pitch travails exposing him to furious protests from angry fans.\n\nHaving ended months of speculation by signing a new two-year contract, Wenger believes if his players put on a united front, the exasperated fans will fall into line behind them.\n\n\"A lot of the trouble was created by my own situation. Maybe I made a mistake,\" said Wenger, who will be without want-away Chile star Alexis Sanchez against Leicester due to injury.\n\n\"Overall I believe that it's down to us. The trend has always to come from the team.\"\n\nThe bulk of the opening weekend's fixtures will be played today and tomorrow, with Chelsea starting at home to Burnley.\n\nCity travel to new-boys Brighton, back in the top tier after a 34-year absence, while United host West Ham.\n\nLiverpool, trying to fend off Barcelona's interest in \u00a3100 million-rated forward Philippe Coutinho, are at Watford.\n\nFixtures (all 4pm unless stated)\n\nToday: Brighton v Manchester City (6:30pm), Chelsea v Burnley, Crystal Palace v Huddersfield, Everton v Stoke, Southampton v Swansea, Watford v Liverpool (1:30pm), West Brom v Bournemouth\n\nTomorrow: Manchester United v West Ham (5pm), Newcastle v Tottenham (2:30pm) - AFP.", "timeCrawl": "01:25:00", "sim": 0.6509804129600525, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8729029", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Two years ago, Leicester City won a championship out of nowhere. Last year, Chelsea -- 10th place the previous year, with a new coach and a raft of new players -- gelled quickly enough to coast to the title. It's tempting to pick another unlikely champion this season, but the year looks to be shaping up as a two-horse, one-town race. One of the Manchester squads -- City or United -- has to be the favorite.\n\nManager Pep Guardiola, fresh from conquering the world at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, took over at Manchester City last year. But his new team finished a distant third and without a single trophy. Guardiola's freewheeling offensive style was let down by an extremely fragile defense. The lowlight was the Champions League round of 16, when City scored five goals in the first leg and still lost to Monaco, after giving up three goals in both matches.\n\nWith that fragility in mind, Guardiola spent big in the offseason, bringing in the two most expensive defenders in history in Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy. Expect them to help solidify City's back line, and expect Guardiola's trophy-free streak to end before it reaches a second season.\n\nStanding in his way, though, will be Manchester United and manager Jose Mourinho, who is aiming to keep an impressive streak going. In five consecutive managerial stints, \"The Special One\" has won the league title in his second season. It speaks to Mourinho's strength: clearly identifying his team's weaknesses, and working ruthlessly (and expensively) to correct them.\n\nThat blend of pragmatism and big-money spending has yet to fail Mourinho, and it would be something of a surprise if things were different at Manchester United, where he's now entering his second year. The Red Devils have not finished in the top three since 2013, but that's a streak that should end this season.\n\nChelsea, as defending champions, will be the most likely to break Manchester's grip on the title. But the Blues have to focus on the Champions League this year as well and might be one or two players short of what's required to compete on two fronts.\n\nTottenham only lost one player from last year's second-place squad but has brought in no reinforcements. It has to play its home games at Wembley Stadium this year as White Hart Lane is rebuilt.\n\nLiverpool couldn't push for a league title last year, with no European distraction, and now, like Chelsea, has two competitions to deal with. Arsenal is still mired in the ugly end stages of manager Arsene Wenger's career.\n\nApart from perhaps Everton, no other team looks to have enough firepower to break into the top six this season. At the top, this year is shaping up as a Manchester duopoly. Picking one of the two is difficult, but picking both to compete for the Premier League title seems obvious.\n\nShort takes\n\n* Apart from Manchester United and Manchester City, I like Chelsea and Tottenham to take the other two top-four Premier League spots. At the bottom, Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town seem likely to make a quick return to the second division. My guess is that Swansea City will join them. And, if I must make a solitary pick for the title, I'll take Manchester United to return to the top of England.\n\n* Second-division club Miami FC dominated the North American Soccer League spring season, but owner Riccardo Silva keeps making waves for other reasons. First, he very publicly offered to buy MLS' media rights, even though they aren't for sale and won't be for six more years. Apparently, he did this so that he could claim that the league had turned him down because he wanted to introduce promotion and relegation. Now, he has applied to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in an attempt to force FIFA into making U.S. Soccer introduce promotion and relegation. I'm starting to wonder why Silva doesn't just buy an MLS franchise and get the whole thing over with.\n\nWEEKEND WATCH GUIDE\n\nPremier League: Liverpool at Watford, 6:30 a.m. Saturday, NBCSN. If Liverpool is going to be part of this year's title race, the Reds cannot afford a slow start. Jurgen Klopp's men appear to be somewhat unsettled, with Barcelona in hot pursuit of attacker Phillipe Coutinho, while Watford breaks in a new manager and a few new players at home.\n\nPremier League: Manchester City at Brighton & Hove Albion, 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Ch. 11. It was only a few years ago that Brighton & Hove Albion nearly folded, with the club bankrupt and the stadium sold to pay off the debts. Now, it's climbed all the way to the Premier League. Amex Stadium should be rocking for opening day.\n\nPremier League: Tottenham at Newcastle, 7:30 a.m. Sunday, NBCSN. It's hard to believe that Newcastle, traditionally one of England's biggest clubs, could ever be relegated, but controversial owner Mike Ashley has achieved it twice. After only one season in the second division, though, Newcastle is back. Can it live up to its reputation this time?\n\nPremier League: West Ham at Manchester United, 10 a.m. Sunday, NBCSN. West Ham largely flew under the radar last season, mostly because of a bad home record in its first season at Olympic Stadium. It's a new year, though, and the Hammers have Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez in the fold. He will return to Manchester United, his old club, with something to prove.", "timeCrawl": "01:47:00", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8730675", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "id": 33, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "id": 34, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

false, "body": "With the 25th season of the Premier League set to kick off after a summer of mad spending, the Palatinate Sport team predict who will be the winners and the losers this time around.\n\nTomas Hill Lopez-Menchero (Sport Editor): It is hard to look past Manchester City after a summer in which Pep Guardiola has overhauled his squad and splashed out over \u00a3200m on several signings in key positions. The likes of Ederson, Benjamin Mendy, Danilo and Kyle Walker are smart additions, while Bernardo Silva could be a steal at \u00a343.6m. City's strength in depth is frightening, and they will have no trouble dealing with the demands of European football while mounting a title assault.\n\nJames Martland (Deputy Sport Editor): Manchester City. Pep Guardiola has performed a much-needed revamp of his squad this summer - a new goalkeeper and three fullbacks are additions in positions which required attention and the acquisition of Bernardo Silva has added excitement to an already talented front line. Question marks remain about John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, but City should outscore most teams this season.\n\nOllie Godden (Deputy Sport Editor): Perhaps controversially, I think Manchester United will take it. They have built a strong squad and I think Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is beginning to build the 'Special One' dynasty that he was so well known for during his Chelsea days. Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic will be an exciting and physical duo in the middle of the park, and while admittedly I'm apprehensive about the impact of \u00a375m Romelu Lukaku, they've recruited a man who can feasibly step into Zlatan's rather large shoes and make them a very good side going forwards. The key to their success will be avoiding a slow start and limiting lost points early on - they will only get stronger throughout the season.\n\nWill Jennings (Deputy Sport Editor): Manchester City invested well to reinforce what was an ageing and vulnerable defence and are still blessed with a range of potent attacking options. Stones will continue to improve and Guardiola will have learned from last year's mistakes. Expect them to be a real force.\n\nTomas Hill Lopez-Menchero: 2 Chelsea, 3 Manchester United, 4 Spurs, 5 Liverpool, 6 Arsenal\n\nChelsea thrived without any European commitments last season, but Antonio Conte has failed to seriously bolster his squad this summer. R\u00fcdiger, Bakayoko and Morata are all good signings, but seem to be high-end replacements rather than genuine additions. This is not to say that Conte's side won't challenge Guardiola's this season, though much depends on whether Morata can replicate the performances of the out-of-favour Diego Costa.\n\nUnited will be much more of a force this time around having recruited well, but Jos\u00e9 Mourinho's team remain some way short of City and Chelsea. Spurs are another side who might rue their lack of transfer activity, even if they have kept last year's spine largely intact, while the temporary move to Wembley will test them. Liverpool will still have a formidable attack if Phillippe Coutinho does leave for Spain but defence is an issue, while despite victory in the Community Shield and the arrival of Alexandre Lacazette, the Europa League schedule will be unforgiving for Arsenal.\n\nJames Martland: 2 Chelsea, 3 Liverpool, 4 Manchester United, 5 Spurs, 6 Arsenal\n\nWith a depleted squad and a much busier schedule, Chelsea are unlikely to be quite as successful this season as last. However, they are still likely to be in with a shout come the end of the season. Liverpool remain a threat with an exciting attacking line, provided they can keep Coutinho out of the clutches of Barcelona. Manchester United are likely to improve slightly on last season as Mourinho continues to build his team. A move to Wembley, meaning a much bigger pitch, is unlikely to have the desired effect for Tottenham, who have a poor record at the ground, while the signing of Alexandre Lacazette, selected behind Olivier Giroud for the French national team, will not solve all of Arsenal's problems.\n\nOllie Godden: 2 Manchester City, 3 Chelsea, 4 Spurs, 5 Arsenal, 6 Everton\n\nThis is the most open race we have ever seen for these spots. Gone are the days of the predictable 'big four' stealing the show, and this is thanks to the quantity of money being spent across the board. The likes of Everton splashing cash this summer opens the league up into dimensions we haven't seen, which is invariably a good thing for the competition. With this in mind, some big clubs will miss out, and there will be a riveting battle for these money-making positions.\n\nWill Jennings: 2 Spurs, 3 Chelsea, 4 Manchester United, 5 Liverpool, 6 Arsenal\n\nDespite their lack of investment, Spurs will be up there again. Retaining Kane, Alli, Son, Dier, Alderweireld and Lloris will prove vital, while Trippier is more than capable of filling the gap left by Kyle Walker. Although Chelsea lost Matic and the Diego Costa situation continues, Conte still has a solid defence - R\u00fcdiger was an excellent piece of business - and Morata will score goals. Mourinho has also bought well at Old Trafford - Lindelof appears a good signing who could forge a productive partnership with Bailly at the back, and Matic will provide an excellent shield in the centre of the park. If Lukaku can emulate his form of recent seasons then United could be a real force going forwards. I'm still unsure about Liverpool's defence and Coutinho's future remains uncertain. Arsenal have failed to improve a serially brittle defence and still lack leaders despite the arrival of Lacazette.\n\nTomas Hill Lopez-Menchero: 18 Burnley, 19 Brighton, 20 Huddersfield\n\nBurnley have made Turf Moor something of a fortress under Sean Dyche, but they will find life much trickier this season. Michael Keane and Andre Gray will be big losses, while Jon Walters and Jack Cork are hardly inspired signings. Brighton and Huddersfield have won many fans over with their fairy-tale rise through the divisions, but will probably find the Premier League a bridge too far. Having said that, I would love to be proven wrong by both teams.\n\nJames Martland: 18 Swansea, 19 Burnley, 20 Brighton\n\nThe departure of Michael Keane, Burnley's best player last campaign, will cause problems for a side who struggled at times last season. With Gylfi Sigurdsson, who kept Swansea up with important goals and assists last year, looking set to leave the club this summer, Swansea are another side who could be in trouble. Brighton deserve their chance at the highest level but may find they are not quite good enough. The likes of Glenn Murray are unlikely to have as large an impact in the Premier League as they did in the Championship.\n\nOllie Godden: 18 Brighton, 19 Burnley, 20 Huddersfield\n\nIt's hard to look further than the newly promoted clubs each season when it comes to relegation, and it's no different this year. Although I'd like to be proven wrong, I think Huddersfield will struggle as their summer business has not seemed to match their ambition of survival. Brighton will make a better fist of things but lacking Premier League knowhow will be a cause for concern. Conversely, Newcastle should blend into mid-table obscurity with their relatively decent squad and Burnley will be the side to stop all three promoted sides plummeting back down.\n\nWill Jennings: 18 Watford, 19 Brighton, 20 Huddersfield\n\nBrighton and Huddersfield are surely bound to struggle. Hughton's side showed signs of psychological shortcomings in failing to secure the Championship title last season and have failed to recruit any players with proven Premier League quality. It seems to be a similar story at Huddersfield - while Wagner's work there has been laudable, they will probably lack the resources to remain in the top flight. Newcastle should be fine owing to the arrivals of Jacob Murphy and Javier Manquillo, so Watford are my pick to fill the remaining spot. Marco Silva is still largely unproven at this level despite relative success at Hull, and they have failed to truly improve their squad.\n\nTomas Hill Lopez-Menchero: It's a boring answer, but Harry Kane. Nobody guarantees goals like the England striker, whose stratospheric rise is almost Roy of the Rovers material. Spurs may not reach the heady heights of last season, but Kane will find the back of the net regardless. Again. And again.\n\nJames Martland: Romelu Lukaku. Few people are convinced by Jose Mourinho's decision to splash \u00a375million on a striker who has struggled to find form against the Premier League's biggest teams. However, the Belgian forward notched 25 leagues goals last campaign and, surrounded by better players, he is likely to improve on that this year.\n\nOllie Godden: It feels like a bit of a cop-out not to stick my neck out with a left-field suggestion, but Harry Kane has to be favourite for me. He has consistently proved himself as a goal scorer in all situations and, notwithstanding Spurs' lack of summer additions, the side is filled with enough quality to feed the England frontman. Despite being shot down when suggesting it to friends, I think Marcus Rashford will also have a very successful season. Constant game time will serve him well and, fitness providing, I'm sure he will have the best goal return of his brief career.\n\nWill Jennings: Despite the movements of Lukaku, Morata and Lacazette, Harry Kane's brilliance should prevail, assisted by the dynamic likes of Son, Alli and Eriksen. He ended last season superbly, and is so clinical with both feet and in the air. A top striker.\n\nTomas Hill Lopez-Menchero: This slightly defeats the point of the category, but I'm going to go for two signings: Ederson to Manchester City and Jordan Pickford to Everton. Both are keepers with hugely promising futures at 23, and both have joined clubs in desperate need of a reliable man between the sticks. Claudio Bravo endured a horrendous debut campaign at City, while Everton have not had a consistent No.1 for a long time. Pickford and Ederson will give their sides certainty at the back once again and allow the two clubs to push on.\n\nJames Martland: Javier Hern\u00e1ndez could be a fantastic signing for West Ham. The Mexican had five seasons at Manchester United, proving his ability to perform in the Premier League, but was never classed as the club's main forward. He went away to Bayer Leverkusen to get more game time, scoring 26 goals in his first season. If he stays fit, Chicharito could fire West Ham into the European places.\n\nOllie Godden: It's never easy to predict how players new to the league will perform and adapt given the unique, fast-paced, physical nature of the Premier League. With that being said, Alexandre Lacazette has to be the best bit of recruitment of the window. While Olivier Giroud has established himself as a firm Premier League performer, they have lacked a cutting edge that his French teammate can find with his pace and power; traits that are synonymous with the recent Arsenal outfits. It seems rather hypocritical predicting a fifth-place finish for the Gooners yet choosing the former Lyon man as a stand-out performer, but, with every team spending more and more, Lacazette will be key to ensuring their European finish.\n\nWill Jennings: A toss-up between four strikers: Jermain Defoe to Bournemouth, Kelechi Iheanacho to Leicester, Tammy Abraham to Swansea on loan and Javier Hern\u00e1ndez to West Ham. All four are brilliant finishers and terrific recruitments, but Hern\u00e1ndez has scored lots of Premier League goals already and will be helped by the creativity of Arnautovic, Ayew and Lanzini behind him.

Taking advantage of astronomical broadcast contracts and lucrative sponsorship deals, England's superpowers have been splashing the cash at an unprecedented rate.\n\nSince the end of last season, transfer records have been shattered across the country as over one billion pounds has changed hands in a frenzy that could well set a new high for a single window.\n\nWhile some fear the spending is unsustainable and will put clubs' long-term stability at risk, the 25th year of the Premier League era should deliver a title race more fiercely contested than ever. Desperate to dethrone champions Chelsea, club record fees have been paid by Manchester United, who splurged a British record \u00a375 million for Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, Arsenal, who forked out \u00a352 million on Lyon forward Alexandre Lacazette and Liverpool, who put down \u00a337 million for Roma winger Mohamed Salah.\n\nManchester City boss Pep Guardiola set the tone with a series of early deals that took his spending in this window to an eye-watering \u00a3218 million.\n\nFrustrated by City's failings in his trophyless first season in England, Guardiola has overhauled his squad with defenders Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo, plus goalkeeper Ederson and playmaker Bernardo Silva. Guardiola's old rival Jose Mourinho hasn't been shy about raiding the United coffers, with the Lukaku swoop headlining a \u00a3140 million spree that also brought Benfica defender Victor Lindelof and Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic to Old Trafford.\n\nMourinho won the league in his second seasons at Porto, Real Madrid and Inter Milan, as well as in both of his stints at Chelsea, but he expects this season's title race to be an almighty scrap. The no limits spending of Chelsea's title rivals prompted a tetchy response from Stamford Bridge, where boss Antonio Conte has been grumbling about his club's failure to land Lukaku and other targets. The bulk of the opening weekend's fixtures will be played on Saturday and Sunday, with Chelsea starting at home to Burnley.\n\nCity travel to new-boys Brighton, back in the top tier after a 34-year absence, while United host West Ham. Liverpool, trying to fend off Barcelona's interest in \u00a3100 million-rated forward Philippe Coutinho, are at Watford. Despite finishing second last season, Tottenham, who face promoted Newcastle on Sunday, have boldly abstained from the spending and are yet to make a single signing.", "timeCrawl": "12:36:00", "sim": 0.615686297416687, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8791499", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Defining because the pair were granted a free pass last term. However, Conte's feat casts a harsh light on how poorly Guardiola and Mourinho performed. Guardiola guided City to an unconvincing third and Mourinho took United to a lowly sixth. As the positions suggest, neither manager was able to mount a serious tilt at the title and thus their respective employers have to find excuses for them and succour from elsewhere.\n\nThe City chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, pointed to the rebuilding job his man began, while Mourinho's two-trophy return, which included the prize of Champions League qualification for claiming the Europa League, was enough for Ed Woodward, the United executive vice-chairman, to move on.\n\nNow, they have to achieve more. The minimum requirement is that Guardiola and Mourinho ensure their team challenge for the title until May. If not, one or both may find themselves out of a job.\n\nChelsea should be viewed as favourites, despite the bookmakers awarding City the status. Whatever, it is difficult to look beyond a big four of the champions, the two Manchester clubs and Tottenham, last season's runners-up, in the search for potential champions.\n\nAt Chelsea, Diego Costa has become persona non grata and will leave. He is a sizeable loss to Conte's cause given the Brazilian's edge and a strike-rate of 20 goals in 35 Premier League appearances last year, which followed 20 in 26 in the 2014-15 title-winning season.\n\nIn Costa's place is \u00c1lvaro Morata, bought from Real Madrid for a club record \u00a370m. The test is whether the 24-year-old can be a classic Chelsea Premier League centre-forward in the mould of Costa and Didier Drogba. Last season, Morata scored 15 in 26 appearances - 14 were starts - that totalled 1,334 minutes, an impressive average of one goal every 88.9 minutes. Morata, almost 6ft 3in, also scored the most headers in La Liga.\n\nAt City, Guardiola has splurged \u00a3199.79m on five players. Four of these are in defensive positions - Ederson, the new No1, and the full-backs Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo, the latter also being a stop-gap holding midfielder. Bernardo Silva signed for \u00a343.6m and joins Guardiola's ever-burgeoning rank of attacking players. This also numbers Kevin de Bruyne, David Silva, Leroy San\u00e9, Sergio Ag\u00fcero, Gabriel Jesus and Raheem Sterling. The old joke about Ars\u00e8ne Wenger adding another No10 to his Arsenal squad when in doubt might apply to Guardiola and forwards.\n\nFollowing last season's travails, City's campaign will depend on how well a leaky defence is tightened up. Guardiola's summer spend is yet to include a centre-back despite this being a problem position. Currently, Vincent Kompany is the only established first-choice centre-half and he has been injury plagued in recent seasons. The captain's two potential partners are the yet-to-do-it John Stones and the underwhelming Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi. Tosin Adarabioyo is the only other recognised central defender and he is 19 and unproven.\n\nMourinho's recruitment has taken in striker Romelu Lukaku, centre-back Victor Lindel\u00f6f and midfielder Nemanja Matic at the cost of around \u00a3146m. At the transfer window's start the 54-year-old identified Lukaku as the prime target. After Zlatan Ibrahimovic's serious knee injury, Mourinho decided Lukaku's 88 league goals since 2012 - only Ag\u00fcero has more in that time- made him the ideal spearhead.\n\nYet might Matic be the recruit that tips the title away from Chelsea and into United's grasp? His significance can be read from Mourinho describing the midfielder as a genius following his debut in the 2-1 friendly win over Sampdoria. It remains a puzzle why Conte allowed Matic to be sold to United.\n\nHis arrival means Paul Pogba will no longer be asked to operate on the peripatetic basis that had him flitting between No6 and No8 and even, at times, No10. Pogba can concentrate on being the surging midfielder the manager wishes, though after United scored a meagre 54 goals - the poorest of last season's top seven - this has to improved or it will not matter how the Frenchman plays.\n\nMourinho, who still wants to add a forward, has talked up Tottenham as challengers as they have kept all the players Mauricio Pochettino wants to retain. Yet the manager has, in turn, failed to freshen up his squad - recently he stressed the need to do so to ensure the competition that will help Harry Kane, Dele Alli and company elevate their game. Even if this changes Spurs are unlikely to better their rivals' strengthening. Chelsea have also added Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko (for \u00a339.7m) and Antonio R\u00fcdiger (\u00a334m), so for Tottenham to finish second again would represent a small triumph.\n\nFor Watford, Burnley and Swansea City, the three clubs that finished last year 17th, 16th and 15th respectively, their cause for celebration will surely be if they once more avoid the drop. Watford have a seventh manager in three years in Marco Silva, and he oversaw Hull City's relegation. Sean Dyche managed to keep the Clarets up for the first time in the Premier League but bringing in just Phil Bardsley, Jon Walters and Jack Cork suggests they will repeat their struggle. And if Gylfi Sigurdsson moves to Everton Swansea will earn a \u00a350m fee but lose his playmaking abilities and last year's nine priceless finishes. The promoted sides - Brighton & Hove Albion, Huddersfield Town and Newcastle United may - also be in the dogfight at the bottom.\n\nAt both ends of the division it promises to be a riveting watch.\n\nThe Guardian Sport\n\nJamie Jackson\n\nMore Posts\n\nFacebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Related", "timeCrawl": "14:00:00", "sim": 0.6039215922355652, "extractedDates": null, "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8630763", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

experienced nearly three months of transfer speculation and deals featuring absurd sums of money, ridiculous rumours and unashamed greed, it is almost a relief that the Premier League finally kicks off this weekend.\n\nOne fixture has already been played, with Arsenal hosting Leicester City at the Emirates last night.\n\nWith the transfer window continuing until Aug 31, there is still plenty of time for significant changes in the line-ups, which makes forecasts a little tricky. At the time of writing we still do not know who Philippe Coutinho or Alexis Sanchez will be playing for. Anyone who enjoys the Premier League hope they won't be going anywhere.\n\nThe Premier League will once again feel more like three leagues-in-one, with the usual suspects vying for the top honours, half a dozen teams almost assured of mid table comfort and the rest fighting to stay in the division. For this final group, there is nothing wrong with 17th place.\n\nThe battle at the top is really a tale of three cities -- London, Manchester and Liverpool.\n\nArsenal will have been boosted by their scrappy victory over Chelsea in the Community Shield. However it would be unwise to make any major judgements based on what is essentially an exhibition match. The Gunners will be pleased with the performance of Serbian Sead Kolasinac, who Theo Walcott accurately described as \"an absolute tank\". Another new signing from Lyon, Alexandre Lacazette, showed some nice touches. However it is not until a final decision is made on Sanchez that Arsene Wenger really knows where he stands.\n\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte looked frustrated on the touchline at Wembley and with good reason. His team never found any rhythm and without Eden Hazard, Chelsea looked out of sorts. They will greatly miss Diego Costa and will be hoping his replacement, Alvaro Morata hits the ground running. The result itself wasn't important as Chelsea have lost their last four appearances in the Community Shield.\n\nTottenham Hotspur were the most attractive side last season, led superbly by Harry Kane, and with much the same squad, apart from the excellent Kyle Walker moving to Manchester City, Spurs should be a threat again. The X-factor is how they will adapt to playing all home fixtures at Wembley stadium.\n\nIn four matches at Wembley last season, they only won once, against CSKA Moscow. In two other Champions League games they lost to Monaco and Leverkusen and there was another defeat to Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final. However, these were all tough opponents and Spurs should overcome the lesser lights of the Premier League.\n\nSpurs must avoid a bad start at Wembley. After tomorrow's away fixture at Newcastle their first home game happens to be against Chelsea which will be a stern test. Silly though it sounds, a series of poor \"home\" results could lead to unhealthy talk of a Wembley \"jinx\".\n\nIt is never easy to play at a new stadium, as West Ham discovered last season. This year the Hammers have another problem as their London Stadium is hosting the current World Athletics championships. This means the Hammers' first home game won't be until Sept 9 against Huddersfield.\n\nThe city of Manchester will once again witness a battle of skills and egos as Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho vie for the bragging rights. They might also be vying for rights to the title as City have a star-studded team. Now the defence has been beefed up with the arrival of Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo they could deliver the title. Bookmakers certainly think so, ranking City as their clear favourites with United and Chelsea joint second.\n\nUnited look a little stronger than last year with the acquisition of Nemanja Matic in midfield, but one suspects they will miss the scoring ability of Zlatan Ibrahimovich a lot more than Wayne Rooney. Much depends on Romelu Lukaku settling in quickly.\n\nLiverpool are desperate to break their duck in the Premier league. But it is unlikely to come this season, particularly if they are unable to hold on to Coutinho. As Jamie Carragher warned: \"If Liverpool lose Coutinho there will be riots.\"\n\nWith Rooney back at Everton you can be sure of plenty of headlines from Goodison Park. If ever a team looked destined for seventh place it's the Toffees.\n\nThe newly promoted clubs tend to be favourites for going straight back down again and there's a good chance Huddersfield and Brighton will only have a brief stay in the top flight. However Brighton fans will be hoping they can \"do a Bournemouth\" and show that the south coast teams have a bit of grit and don't spend all their time sitting in deckchairs on the beach sunning themselves.\n\nAs long as Newcastle United hang on to manager Rafa Benitez they should survive, although it could still be bit of a struggle for the Magpies. What doesn't bode too well is that the bookies have Benitez joint favourite as the first manager to leave his club, along with Mark Hughes at Stoke.\n\nOf the other teams that could face relegation worries, Watford might be in for a long season. Burnley are celebrating having survived a Premier League season for the first time, but will have to work hard to make it two in a row. Swansea too might find themselves in the thick of things if they lose talented midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nLet's just hope it's a close race both at the top and bottom and wouldn't it be great if an unfancied club did another another Leicester City and shook everything up.

"body": "Premier League - who gets your vote as the 2017/18 winner?\n\nLast Updated: 11/08/17 8:26pm\n\nThe Premier League season has arrived and now we are simply asking who you think will win the 2017-18 title.\n\nArsenal kicked things off against Leicester on Friday Night Football, but there are hundreds of games between that opening game of the season and the trophy eventually being handed out.\n\nSo who will it be?\n\nChampions Chelsea have made some big moves in the transfer market, although manager Antonio Conte is keen to do more business before the end of the month. Striker Diego Costa appears set to leave but can Alvaro Morata replace his fellow Spain international's goals? And what will defender Antonio Rudiger and new midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko bring to their squad?\n\nManchester City are favourites with the bookmakers (but what do they know?) after splashing bundles of money on defensive players this summer. Kyle Walker cost them \u00a350m, while City also went hard after full-backs Benjamin Mendy and Danilo, also adding Bnefica goalkeeper Ederson into the mix. Will that, and a full season from Gabriel Jesus, be enough to turn around a 15-point deficit.\n\nTottenham were Chelsea's closest rivals last season, finishing seven points adrift of the champions, but they head into the season without having made a single addition to their senior squad. Walker has departed for City and replacement Kieran Trippier is under an injury cloud. Much will therefore depend on Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli just as it did in 2016-17.\n\nManchester United have only added three players so far this summer, apparently to Jose Mourinho's frustration, but Romelu Lukaku, Victor Lindelof and Nemanja Matic will still cost them more than \u00a3160m combined. Lukaku will be counted on to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goals but he managed 25 for Everton last season and is now reunited with his former boss at Chelsea. It could be an exciting season at Old Trafford.\n\nArsenal also have a new striker to go to war with, in the form of Alexandre Lacazette, but most of their hopes could lie on the future of two longer-serving players. Alexis Sanchez's future continues to be the subject of much speculation and Mesut Ozil is also still without a new contract. The pressure is most definitely on for the red half of north London after missing out on the Champions League.\n\nAnd that leads us to the red half of Merseyside, where Liverpool find themselves in a similar boat to Arsenal. Their star player Philippe Coutinho fancies a move to Barcelona, but the club are keen to keep hold of the Brazilian - how will that affect their early season form? Jurgen Klopp has added Mo Salah to his attacking options and England U21 striker Dominic Solanke could prove a bargain signing, but what of their goalkeeper and defence? Will they pass muster for another long Premier League season?\n\nEverton have been far busier and made some very interesting additions as they look to push into the top six, or even the Champions League spots. Prodigal son Wayne Rooney returns after 13 years away from the club at Man Utd, and the proceeds of the Lukaku sale have also seen the arrival of Sunderland goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, Burnley's England defender Michael Keane and Ajax midfielder Davy Klaassen, who could be a shrewd purchase.\n\nSo where does your vote go?\n\nAlso See: Ultimate Premier League guide Carra, Redknappon top seven", "timeCrawl": "19:30:00", "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8688470", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Written by Karan Prashant Saxena | Published:August 11, 2017 10:48 pm While the pressure on Wenger is real this year, the pressure for Mourinho is to rebuild his reputation. (Source: Reuters) Jose Mourinho is a great manager, says Gareth BaleEnglish Premier League 2017-18: Smartest signings in the window this seasonPep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho spending heavily to dethrone Chelsea\n\nIn Fox's sci-fiction drama series X-Files, a character named \"cigarette-smoking man\", was played by actor, William B Davis, who looked strikingly similar to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. But the similarities do not end there. The cigarette-smoking man in the show was killed on numerous occasions, only to return season-after-season. Sounds familiar?\n\nJust when things looked horrid for Wenger, with fans protesting on streets, mouthing abuses and \"Wenger Out\" becoming an everyday chant in London, the manager found a way to survive. Yet again. A season which saw Arsenal losing out their top-4 place for the first time since the 1995-96 season was saved once again by an emphatic FA Cup victory against Premier League Champions Chelsea.\n\nThe pressure on Wenger is real this year. With a comparatively lighter schedule, due to no Champions League fixtures, the fans expect the Gunners to challenge for the title. Going by the recent rise in numbers of managers being sacked in EPL, Wenger cannot take his two-year signed contract for granted and must find a way to regain some of the faith he has lost among the fans.\n\nThe season has started well, with new signings Alexander Lacazette and Sead Kolanisac, looking in supreme touch. His recent win against Chelsea to lift the Community Shield would have given a boost to his side. Wenger would hope to start off his campaign with a solid win against Leicester on the opening day.\n\nIn last six years, Arsenal has won only one of their opening day matches. A win against former EPL winners will probably lift the spirits of the manager and make fans get behind him again.\n\nJose Mourinho\n\nManchester United manager Jose Mourinho has gone with what he knows best this season. Investing in a solid defender in Victor Lindelof, along with a defensive midfielder in Nemanja Matic from Chelsea, Mourinho appears to be returning to his defensive best (or parking-the-bus strategy). Moreover, instead of investing in doubtful Alvaro Morata, the Portuguese manager decided to bank on someone he has managed before in Romelu Lukaku.\n\nThe pressure for Mourinho is to rebuild his reputation. He is known to be the manager who gets things done by his second season, and several football pundits are expecting him to give United another Premier League trophy. At a time, when English teams are going with young, vibrant managers such as Antonio Conte and Jurgen Klopp, Mourinho needs to prove he is getting better with age.\n\nThe primary aim for the manager will be to not drop too many points and look for wins against weaker oppositions. Unfortunately, for Mourinho, the first fixture against West Ham, who have done tremendous business in the summer transfer, can get tricky.\n\nPep Guardiola\n\nManchester City manager Pep Guardiola recognised the problem in his team last year. The average age of his squad was just too high. The former Bayern Munich manager has invested in a lot of young talent and has mounted a \u00a3217 million defence featuring the new comers Benjamin Mendy, Danilo, Kyle Walker and Ederson.\n\nThe pressure on Guardiola is to now convert the money that is invested into trophies. As a manager, his first year at Etihad was his worst ever. It was the first time in his career that he had failed to acquire a single trophy and had ended in the third position on the table. The Spanish manager has fixed the leaks in the team, by releasing several older players to set a younger team.\n\nThis time, Guardiola has no excuses left. He has to live up to his reputation and give City fans something to cheer for. Or he might reduce down to yet another Premier League flop manager.\n\nJurgen Klopp\n\nIt's been almost two years since former Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp has signed on with Liverpool. While the side has regained some of its confidence under his tenure and regained Champions League football, it has failed to win too many trophies. The coveted Premier League trophy seems still out of grasp for the club.\n\nKlopp has signed fast midfielders in Sadio Mane and Mohammed Salah, which suits his style of vibrant and dynamic football. But, in a weird way, Liverpool often finds a way to drop points against slower teams. In the previous season, the Scousers lost against Bournemouth, Swansea and Crystal Palace among other weaker oppositions.\n\nThe pressure is on Klopp to live up to fans' expectations, which he has failed to do so far in England. Losing out on Philippe Coutinho, who has undoubtedly been the star player for the club over the years, is another huge blow that will hurt Klopp's confidence.\n\nFor all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: English Premier League Jose Mourinho Pep Guardiola", "timeCrawl": "17:27:00", "sim": 0.5843137502670288, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-11", "textStart": 320, "amb": false, "textEnd": 335}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8670328", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "id": 486, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

look at some of the talking points ahead of the opening round of fixtures.\n\nCAN THE BIG-MONEY MEN PROVE THEIR WORTH?\n\nRomelu Lukaku, Alvaro Morata, Benjamin Mendy, Alexandre Lacazette, Kyle Walker and Bernardo Silva. Not a bad way to spend some \u00c2\u00a3322million, plus you could always throw in Nemanja Matic, Mohamed Salah, Ederson, Tiemoue Bakayoko, Antonio Rudiger and indeed Victor Lindelof if you have another \u00c2\u00a3210m or so knocking about.\n\nDespite the best efforts of Paris St-Germain, the Premier League continues to flex its collective financial muscle across all 20 member clubs - well, Tottenham aside perhaps. The true value of such colossal expenditure will be measured in goals and points, at both ends of the table - and we can expect plenty more spending when the January sales come along which will offer more than a few panic buys, cheap at half the price.\n\nWILL COU STAY OR WILL COU GO?\n\nPhilippe Coutinho handing in a transfer request was never going to be good news for Liverpool - and especially not on the eve of a new season, not to mention a key Champions League play-off tie.\n\nThe boss confirms Philippe Coutinho will not be available for the trip to Watford due to a back problem. pic.twitter.com/86V501ko06 -- Liverpool FC (@LFC)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nWhether or not the Brazilian will indeed still \"remain a member of Liverpool Football Club when the summer (transfer) window closes\", as the club's owners Fenway Sports Group insisted in a strongly-worded statement on Friday, we will have to wait and see. There is no doubt the player's head will have been turned. How he, and the club, deals with that will be key to whether Jurgen Klopp's men can press on to mount another sustained assault on the top four or have to settle for also rans.\n\nWILL CHELSEA ENDURE ANOTHER 'MOURINHO SEASON'?\n\nAntonio Conte's side earned so much praise last season for the way they regrouped from a poor start to go on and deliver the Premier League crown with a new record of 30 wins. However, the Italian, who was rewarded with new improved terms, started to show his frustrations at continued questions of the summer transfer policy in the wake of defeat in the FA Community Shield to Arsenal at Wembley.\n\nWhen the boss joins in... \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u008c pic.twitter.com/E5KawcbYs3 -- Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nConte, though, insisted at Friday's press conference ahead of the Premier League opener against Burnley he was ''not looking for sympathy'' over the size of the Blues' squad as they prepare to tackle the Champions League once again as well as defend their domestic title. Get things right on both fronts and Conte's stature will continue to rise. Fail and, well, we all know what happens when things don't go to plan at Stamford Bridge, eh Jose?\n\nTOP FOUR OR BUST?\n\nDespite finishing the campaign on a high with victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup final at Wembley, Arsenal fans are facing up to life in the Europa League after finishing outside the top four for the first time under Arsene Wenger. It is, though, not only the Gunners who look to have a fight on their hands to get themselves back into at least the Champions League shake-up.\n\nRead more from Jose Mourinho's press conference, including quotes on West Ham, Chicharito and Zlatan: https://t.co/eoYuL9k1Kn pic.twitter.com/PDtKhhgp8i -- Manchester United (@ManUtd)\n\nAugust 11, 2017\n\nDespite their success in winning the Europa League, Manchester United could only manage sixth, and what impact Chelsea's own European campaign will have on their title defence remains to be seen, with Manchester City tipped to come good under Pep Guardiola after last season's shortcomings. Spurs too will also face questions about life away from White Hart Lane. Throw in an ambitious Everton side boosted by some solid summer business and there looks little margin for error in any team's top-four ambitions, let along targeting the title itself.\n\nCAN THE SEAGULLS SOAR & WILL THE TERRIERS SHOW THEIR TEETH?\n\nBrighton and Huddersfield will no doubt bring a welcome breath of fresh air in their maiden Premier League campaigns. While many pundits expect both to be scrapping for points at the wrong end of the table, each club has the set up, playing talent and the man at the helm to more than hold their own among the big boys. Just as Swansea, Bournemouth, Watford and Burnley have shown, with the right approach staying clear of the survival battle can be achieved - and not necessarily just by spending big. If they get things right from the start, plenty of the more \"established\" clubs could soon be looking anxiously over their shoulders.

Meanwhile, Mauricio Pochettino had a Wembley hex to ponder at Tottenham long before Danny Rose started offering up alternative spending plans.\n\nA complex narrative will start to unfold from when Arsenal host Leicester City on Friday. How these big issues play out will have a big say over where it leads.\n\nHad Antonio Conte fielded his favoured 3-4-2-1 formation from the get-go last season there is every chance his imperious Chelsea would have broken the 100-point barrier, such was their mastery of England's top flight from October onwards last term.\n\nChelsea's was a dominance that means they should be entering 2017-18 in a position of enviable strength, but it has been a curious close season at Stamford Bridge. Diego Costa remains on the books despite Conte, it has emerged, informing him in January he would no longer be required, while reported transfer targets such as Leonardo Bonucci, Danilo and Romelu Lukaku have gone elsewhere.\n\nThe Italian has been barely subtle in implying his dissatisfaction with those misses, while Nemanja Matic leaving to join Manchester United does not appear to have been a move he enjoyed his board sanctioning.\n\nThrow in the unusual development of Conte signing a new contract that is not an extension on his term at Chelsea and Eden Hazard missing the start of the campaign and a few chimes of discomfort combine to sound an alarm that yells \"2015-16\" - that terrible, previous title defence that saw Jose Mourinho sacked before Christmas.\n\nIt is implausible Chelsea will implode in such a fashion again, but Conte's surly reaction to last weekend's Community Shield loss against Arsenal was not a good look. They must banish any parallels with that shambling campaign as circumstantial nonsense quickly.\n\nLast season was billed as Pep v Jose, El Clasico comes to Manchester or any other grand moniker related to Messrs Guardiola and Mourinho pitching up in the same city. But for all that Manchester City performed with dazzling attacking brio at their best and United claimed the EFL Cup and the Europa League, they finished third and sixth respectively, Chelsea a vanishing speck in the distance.\n\nBoth men have been backed handsomely to reshape the talented but imbalanced squads they inherited in their own image - blueprints that have not been compromised by recent experience.\n\nMatic and Lukaku represent classic Mourinho signings as he approaches his second season at a club, a point at which he famously always wins the league. An imposing presence at the base of the midfield and a powerful, dominant centre forward have been present whenever he has done his best work.\n\nGuardiola's experience in England has apparently resulted in him doubling down on his attacking principles. Even the defensive signings - Kyle Walker, Danilo and Benjamin Mendy - have been selected for their propensity to bomb forward relentlessly from full-back.\n\nBernardo Silva is mouth-watering recruit who will rub shoulders with Kevin De Bruyne and David Silva in an enviable creative hub. Nevertheless, a soft centre remains, with a reliance on the injury ravaged Vincent Kompany stronger than ever and a sense that Yaya Toure and Fernandinho's aging legs will be overrun decisively at some point. It will not be dull.\n\nAt present the truce is laden with silverware. Arsenal's last two competitive matches have been against Chelsea and both ended with a trophy. In between lifting the FA Cup and the Community Shield, Arsene Wenger penned a new contract and smashed his club's transfer record to bring in lethal France marksman Alexandre Lacazette. No Champions League, no problem?\n\nBut with one contract saga over, two more come sharply into focus. Wenger insists Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil - the former seemingly far more coveted than the latter - will not be sold despite entering the final year of their contracts. The reasoning that comparable replacements would not be available is sound but Arsenal and their stars with uncertain futures must stay long in the title race for the truce to hold.\n\nA little further west than usual in north London, Tottenham reside temporarily at Wembley. A first home game against Chelsea means a risk that their dismal record of defeats at the national stadium will extend, but it is unlikely to continue for Mauricio Pochettino's wonderful team.\n\nNevertheless, Rose's questioning of Spurs' wage structure, transfer policy and squad depth in his Sun interview shed uncomfortable light on the strains endured by a club punching above their weight. They must box clever to retain their place at the top table.\n\nIf Klopp had a Liverpool player asking questions similar to Rose's they might well have a point. Mohamed Salah's arrival from Roma means the burden on providing pace and dynamism in attack should not fall so heavily upon Sadio Mane, but the return of Champions League football to Anfield will ask plenty of questions of a team who took chunks out of many rivals last term before being undone by a midwinter collapse. The battle for Coutinho will understandably be fought until - and probably after - it becomes futile.\n\nIf any of last year's top six falter, Everton are primed to crash the party. Irrespective of whether Wayne Rooney's return can live up to the fairytale, Ronald Koeman has enjoyed a productive off-season. Jordan Pickford and Michael Keane are in an ideal place to push for England starting spots and Sandro Ramirez arrives on Merseyside having scored one more LaLiga goal than Neymar in 2016-17.

"body": "Antonio Conte is said to be a frustrated man as he patrols Chelsea's Cobham Training Centre.\n\nDespite spending \u00a3140-million thus far in the transfer window, the rub of the green seemingly is not going his way.\n\nThe Blues boss, now in his second season with the club, and moving into a English Premier League campaign in which his squad will fight to defend the title, while trying to make a dent in European competition, said this past week, as reported by AP: \"It's very important to try to find the right solution, to try to improve the squad for sure we want to avoid the (Jose) Mourinho season.\"\n\nThat does not sound like a man bursting with confidence, more so when you realise that his \"Special One\" jibe refers to the Portuguese mentor's disastrous 2015/16 season with the Blues.\n\nThat year, 2015, Mourinho was ejected from the club in December after the then defending champions had lost nine of their first 16 matches.\n\nStamford Bridge would go on watching the fairy tale ending of Leicester City's championship run from 10th position at the end of a tumultuous season of unrest and mutiny.\n\nConte's disaffection is easy to pinpoint.\n\nDuring this off-season, he has lost out on the signing of striker Romelu Lukaku (to Manchester United) and defender Kyle Walker (to Manchester City), while there is the puzzle of Nemanja Matic's transfer - described by Conte as a 'great loss' - to rivals Manchester United, which leaves a gaping hole in his midfield.\n\nDiego Costa is apparently going to play no part in the Blues' push to defend the league title this season - he is said to have been exiled by Conte via text - and was this past week spotted in Brazil playing a game of footy with his mates.\n\nHis replacement, \u00a365m signing \u00c1lvaro Morata was mostly a bench-warmer for Real Madrid last season and there are serious questions surrounding whether he will have as much of an impact as the bullish Costa.\n\nAdded to these concerns, are the injuries to Eden Hazard and Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko, Matic's \u00a340m replacement - both will miss the beginning of the season.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea's biggest competitors this coming season, Manchester City and United, have spent \u00a3405m in the transfer market thus far and both Pep Guardiola and Mourinho, arguably, now have the squads they have been building steadily towards.\n\nMeanwhile, Tottenham, who finished second last, have quietly chugged along, but a repeat performance looks increasingly a long shot.\n\nAlthough they have an excellent coach in Mauricio Pochettino, they are being left behind in the transfer market - which in such a dynamic environment can only spell disaster.\n\nPredicting a season at its start can often be an embarrassing reminder at its end, but without fear but a little bit of favour, I would say that City are the likely champions come May 13 next year, with United runners-up.\n\nChelsea and Liverpool will close out the Champions League spots - I believe Arsenal have stagnated somewhat under Arsene Wenger and, although they will push for a top four spot, they will ultimately sew up the much-derided fifth spot and Europa League qualification.\n\nOn the other side of the spectrum, you'd expect Huddersfield and Brighton and Hove Albion to drop immediately, while the last relegation spot falls on former champions Leicester.\n\nHere are the predictions - some of them more hopeful, than realistic - for this season, as augured by the hacks of The Star and Pretoria News in no particular order.\n\nMatshelane

until the 2017/18 exam season is upon us. Travis Walton is your guide to the twenty teams set to compete for the most-coveted league title in world football. 20th: Huddersfield Town\n\nPoor Huddersfield. No sooner than they had achieved playoff penalty joy at Wembley, the world of football was already predicting an abysmal Premier League season ahead that could perhaps rival Derby County's infamous low of 10 years ago. Whilst I don't think it will be that bad, they are almost certainly nailed on for relegation, especially after being promoted with a negative goal difference. They have however made some smart signings, including Aaron Mooy on a permanent deal from Manchester City. Having been on loan last season, the Australian was talismanic in Huddersfield's charge from the championship and surely will be again if they are to have any hope of surviving in the Premier League.\n\n19th: Burnley\n\nFollowing Huddersfield down to the championship will be Burnley. Despite having a solid coach in Sean Dyche, you feel that their away form will once again be a huge problem for them and it is hard to see them replicating the fantastic home form they displayed in the first half of last season. They look a bit light defensively following the sale of Michael Keane to Everton and will quickly need to reinvest those funds or face potentially dire consequences. One man who is likely to keep the calm at the back is goalkeeper Tom Heaton, whose form will again be crucial to helping Burnley fight for survival.\n\n18th: Crystal Palace\n\nPerhaps my boldest prediction of the lot given the quality in Palace's side and their attacking threat. However, if the back end of last season is anything to go by, even after the sacking of Pardew, Palace could be in serious trouble. After flopping miserably at Inter, I am not convinced de Boer has the know how to get this Palace Side clicking. The team is also certainly vulnerable to frailties in numerous positions, with the lack of transfer activity over the summer leaving the ambitions for the side this season in serious doubt. Towards the end of last season, Wilfried Zaha began to look much better with a more consistent end product going forward, and will again be the key man for Palace's ambitions.\n\n17th: Brighton and Hove Albion\n\nEqually bold is predicting Brighton to stay in the premier league, a team who many in the world of football have tipped to go straight back down. I think much like their south coast counterparts Bournemouth two years ago, Brighton could be the surprise package in the top flight this season. There is no doubt they will be embroiled in a relegation battle this season, and it will be interesting to see how manager Chris Hughton copes this time around after some very mixed seasons in the Premier league over recent years. A few more signings though and I think they could be ready for the challenge, and the form of championship player of the year Anthony Knockaert could once again prove central to Brighton in their fight against the drop.\n\n16th: Swansea City\n\nAfter a relegation scare last season, the Premier League's welsh outpost will be prepared for perhaps a similar fight this season. The Swans had an extremely leaky defence last year, and that still needs addressing if they are to survive. I think they'll pull through the fight again and keep their place in the top flight but much of that depends if they can hold onto midfield talisman and set piece specialist Gylfi Sigurdsson until the end of the transfer window. If they can't, you feel they would struggle massively, and perhaps see their seven year stay in the top flight come to an end.\n\n15th: Newcastle United\n\nDoesn't the North East just look so much better now that the black and white has returned to the top flight? regardless of any power shift in that region, Newcastle and Rafa will have a fight on their hands to stay here. They haven't had a particularly inspired transfer window but the squad already had a considerable amount of Premier League quality even when they were in the championship, with Jonjo Shelvey retaining his place as the key man in the centre of the park for the Magpies. A lot of work needs to be done between now and the 31st of August, but Rafa Benitez is a top class manager who will steer them to safety, even if he's not particularly used to fighting relegation battles.\n\n14th: Watford\n\nAfter two fairly stable seasons in the Premier League, I expect much of the same from Watford, in spite of the fact that their manager position seems to be governed by a revolving door. Marco Silva is the new man this time around, and despite being relegated with Hull, being given a full season with Watford will give him a chance to play his exciting brand of football that has given him a good reputation in his short time in England. It is likely that Watford will once again be on the fringes of a relegation battle and still need more firepower up front to secure their safety. Captain Troy Deeney will again be leading from the front, and it is hard to think of a man more valuable to this Watford side and their battle to maintain Premier League survival again.\n\n13th: Stoke City\n\nI feel this is the year where Mark Hughes' Stoke project will begin to unravel. Having peaked a couple of years ago, this team is on a downwards slope and it doesn't appear that their summer business has done much to change that. They probably have too much quality to go down and 13th place wouldn't be disastrous for them, but another finish outside of the top half would represent a disappointment, and they could yet slide lower than that. Jack Butland was a big miss for them between the sticks for the majority of last season, and his timely return will be massively beneficial to Stoke's fortunes at the back.\n\n12th: Bournemouth\n\nAfter impressively finishing in ninth place last year despite being on the fringes of a relegation battle, this year should be somewhat smoother for the Cherries. Josh King may have the mark of a one season wonder, but Eddie Howe's side have made smart signings all over the pitch to fit into the man's entertaining style of football. The impressive attack has been reinforced and the defensive concerns have been somewhat addressed, although one more signing may be needed at the back to fully steady the ship. Junior Stanislas has become increasingly pivotal to the tempo of his team's attack, and you can see his influence in the side growing this year as both he and the team continue to adapt to the top flight.\n\n11th: West Ham United\n\nAfter falling short last year and being on the fringes of a relegation battle, i am expecting slightly better from the hammers this time around. The position may not change an awful lot, but I'm sure the performances will be a lot more encouraging. The big worry is the defence, and though minor changes have been made to it this summer, it'll be interesting to see if the backline holds up. The credibility of Slaven Bilic as a manager is still a topic of debate in the football community, but one move that cannot be questioned is the signing of Javier Hernandez. A classic goal poacher who knows the Premier League inside out, the Mexican should be one of the signings of the season and will no doubt add excitement to West Ham's attack.\n\n10th: West Bromwich Albion\n\nIt was a solid and resolute season for West Brom last year, securing survival by the end of February. They may not always possess bags of excitement, but remain in the safe hands of Tony Pulis and it is hard to see their position being threatened for as long as he remains in charge. They have a winnable first five games on paper, so don't be surprised to see them racing out of the blocks early on. A few additions have been made to the already solid squad, and they should keep the team competitive in the face of an ever more difficult league. Matt Phillips shone brilliantly on the wing for the Baggies throughout the middle third of last season, and his sharp end product will again be key in the team's attacking threat.\n\n9th: Leicester City\n\nLast season was the definition of a mixed bag of fortunes for Leicester city. A mediocre start, which then came close to a relegation scrap, and ended in the relative comfort of mid table. Craig Shakespeare did a brilliant job of guiding the Foxes to safety, but the big question is whether he can continue the work he has so well begun. Unlike last summer, the signings look both impressive and capable of fitting into the team's lightning fast counter attacking style of football, and have been gathered with shrewd judgement. The most impressive signature of all though is that of young striker Kelechi Iheanacho, who is already being touted as both a bargain and one of the potential signings of the season. More importantly, he could finally be the suitable strike partner that a player like Jamie Vardy has been crying out for.\n\n8th: Southampton\n\nAfter a season filled with some impressive results and uninspired football, Southampton will be hoping that new manager Mauricio Pellegrino can bring back the exciting brand of football so excellently displayed by the likes of Pochettino and Koeman. The team's strength lies in the back line, although if Virgil Van Dijk is to move elsewhere then they will need to find a ready made and suitable replacement, as well as add more power to their forward line. It should be another year of smooth sailing for the Saints so long as they can get the business right between now and August the 31st, and it should also be more exciting with the development of Nathan Redmond. The young winger certainly has talent but just needs to find greater consistency, and you feel that when he does, he will be capable of worrying any fullback in the league.\n\n7th: Everton\n\nIts been a summer of massive rebuilding for Everton, with Ronald Koeman's project seemingly accelerating. They were almost an island on their own last season; a country mile ahead of those immediately below them, but still considerably behind those immediately above them. Whilst I think the majority of the new signings will massively benefit the team and they will certainly worry the sides above them, I still think they'll finish in the same position as last season. They will likely be a lot closer to the top six points wise, but its difficult to see them breaking the ever growing dominance of those teams. After a fantastic individual season last year, much attention will be paid to new goalkeeper Jordan Pickford after his big money move, and if he fixes Everton's goalkeeping issue, he could well become an indispensable player to this XI.\n\n6th: Liverpool\n\nIt was a satisfactory season for Liverpool last time out as they returned to the top four and played some pretty exciting stuff under Klopp. However, the defence has been a concern for several years now and the Reds are vulnerable to severe unpredictability, regardless of the ever increasing firepower in their attack. This prediction is largely based on the assumption that Coutinho is on his way out and the defence won't be significantly strengthened by August 31st, otherwise I would back them to finish higher. Should the Brazilian leave, it would appear likely that Sadio Mane will take over his spot as the main man, with his lightning pace, dribbling ability, and ever increasing goal threat.\n\n5th: Arsenal\n\nAfter Arsene Wenger's 20 year streak of taking Arsenal into the Champions League ended last year with a 5th placed finish, it will be interesting to see how the team responds to such a defining event. Some smart moves have been made in the market, and holding onto Alexis Sanchez could be the best of the lot, but the Gunners still look a bit frail in the middle of the park and a tad light defensively. This team still needs work before it can re-emerge in the top four, but there is no doubt Arsenal will be presented with opportunities to shunt their rivals out of a place in Europe's elite competition. The attack is looking increasingly strong, but much attention will be paid to the increasing development of young centre back Rob Holding, who looked impressive towards the end of last year and could be pushing for a place in England's world cup squad next summer.\n\n4th: Tottenham Hotspur\n\nAfter a brilliant and record breaking season for Spurs last year, the team will be looking to build on their position by launching a serious title challenge. There is certainly a suggestion they could win it, with a squad that is both young, deep in options, and improving week by week. Though as this team comes of age, the decision to stay quiet in the market this summer could be a hammer blow to the their ambitions. A lack of new faces to provide competition will lead to players becoming both comfortable and complacent, traits that almost guarantee failure in a quest for trophies. The team is so strong it is hard to see them finishing outside the top four, but I think they will drop somewhat this year by finishing in fourth place. Harry Kane is the undisputed star of this team following back to back golden boot wins, and at just 24, how good can he be for this side?\n\n3rd: Chelsea\n\nChelsea indisputably had a dream season in the league last year under Antonio Conte, sweeping teams away and smashing records with their galloping wing-backs, smart midfielders and plucky 3-4-3 setup. However, consecutive league titles haven't been achieved by any team in the Premier League since 2009, and whilst they have made some astute signings this summer, it is difficult to see them breaking that eight year curse. They will no doubt present a considerable title challenge and have the belief that they can beat anyone in the league, but it is a mountain of a challenge to repeat last year's form, and I think the Blues will drop ever so slightly this season. Bakayoko was one of the more logical signings achieved this summer, and being similar to Kante in his style of play, Chelsea will have a wall in the middle of the park that will be difficult for even the best attackers to try and break down.\n\n2nd/1st: Manchester United\n\nOkay, I haven't discreetly labelled my title winners because I think that this year will truly be the Manchester-oriented battle that last season was hyped up to be. Much has been said of Mourinho and his 'second season' magic, but nothing is set in stone and his side will have to improve massively from last year if they are to both return to the top four and mount a serious title challenge. The need to kill off games has been both recognised and addressed with huge signings this summer who many feel can propel the Red Devils to the next level and get them close to their former glory. With a fee of around \u00a375 million paid, all eyes will be on frontman Romelu Lukaku. Generally a guarantee for goals and a player capable of worrying any centre back, is he just the man United needed to initiate a proper title challenge?\n\n2nd/1st: Manchester City\n\nThe bookies favourites for the title, and of course the other party in this Manchester oriented battle. As a City fan myself, odds count for little and just because the team can win the league, it does not mean they will and nothing can be taken for granted. This contest is desperately close to call. However, after huge sums of money have been spent and the team is moulded into Pep's image, you would at least expect a serious title challenge to take place on the blue half of Manchester. The fullback weakness has been addressed magnificently, with the only weaknesses now perhaps lying in the centre of defence and central midfield. The usual suspects will be tasked with pulling the strings and firing the goals going forward but watch out for new boy Benjamin Mendy down the left flank. Strong, fast, and hugely influential at both ends of the pitch, the French defender could well take the league by storm this year.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nThe Premier League Returns!

aren't champions this year\n\nIf they don't it will be the manager's fault because Pep Guardiola is the only one who can cost them title in my opinion.\n\nHe's been given the money, he's bought the players, and he's got a squad that can score bundles and bundles of goals.\n\nI said they badly needed full backs and they bought three in Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Danilo, all players other teams wanted. They also bought a new keeper, spent a small fortune on Bernardo Silva, and will probably still get Alexis Sanchez as well.\n\nIf they don't win it, serious questions should be asked of Guardiola. He still needs to mix his game up a bit because they played themselves into trouble so many times last season.\n\nBut I think he will. He just needs a bit more Mourinho about him. He was too stubborn last year and refused to change his principles. But every game is a grind here. Surely he can see it now.\n\nManchester City predicted line-up to face Brighton MANCHESTER CITY face Brighton in their opening match of the Premier League campaign - here's our predicted line-up for the match. 1 / 13 MANCHESTER CITY FC Manchester City predicted line-up to face Brighton: 3-5-2\n\n\"I don't think Chelsea missed out on Romelu Lukaku. Morata is a better fit for them\"\n\nPaul Merson\n\nChelsea's squad looks nowhere near big enough to challenge them. Antonio Conte is right to complain because it will be tougher for them this time.\n\nThey have the Champions League to contend with and more games to play, but they haven't really strengthened, and they let Nemanja Matic go to a rival.\n\nSome of those players have won the league two out of the last three seasons and I think they will want the Champions League more. Conte might too. He's never won it and has something to prove.\n\nAlvaro Morata is a top player but how long will it take him to settle? I don't think Chelsea missed out on Romelu Lukaku. Morata is a better fit for them. But he'll need time to adapt to English football.\n\nLukaku's not bright enough to play with Eden Hazard and Cesc Fabregas. He needs the ball over the top, and he'll get that at Manchester United. But I still don't think United have enough to open teams up. They don't have enough guile.\n\nLukaku needs the ball over the top, Paul Pogba won't thread the ball through the eye of a needle, Ander Herrera is one of their best players but he's a dogger, and is Jesse Lingard good enough?\n\nHenrikh Mkhitaryan is the only one really, but you need more than that.\n\nLiverpool could struggle as well. No Adam Lallana for three months, and I still think Philippe Coutinho will go.\n\nWhen Barcelona or Real Madrid come calling, you go. Everybody wants to go there, and for \u00a3100m you'd drop him off yourself.\n\nI mean, if Liverpool can't find someone to get more goals than Coutinho did last year for less than \u00a3100m the game's gone!\n\nArsenal are Arsenal, they won't win it.\n\nAnd then you look at Tottenham and what have they done? Who had the best window? Oh definitely Tottenham...\n\nGETTY\n\nPhilippe Coutinho will get his move to Barcelona\n\nTheir away record wasn't great last season and now they're playing 38 away games because of Wembley. If Harry Kane gets injured it's game over.\n\nYou can't win the league with 13 players. Impossible.\n\nSo it's all set up for City for me. I think they will score a ton of goals and if Guardiola gets it right I don't see who can stop them.\n\n-----\n\nI'VE said all along that we need retrospective bans for diving and I think we will cut it out now they've finally brought it in.\n\nYou can see it from a mile off sometimes and no-one's being punished. Managers could end up losing their jobs as the result of a dive in a big game.\n\nBut give it a few weeks of players being banned for diving and they will stop. They will have to. I just hope the people on the panels are strong enough to get tough because they will be calling somebody a cheat effectively.\n\nBut that is what diving is and I think it will be nipped in the bud very quickly if we are tough with it. People like Eden Hazard and Wilf Zaha get accused of diving all the time, but they're also the most fouled players in the league.\n\nIt's not an issue if you go down too easily in the middle of the pitch - but when it's to win a penalty, that's not right, and it must be stopped.\n\nIt's about time the FA took action. They've just got to be strong and stick to their guns.\n\nGETTY\n\nEden Hazard is one of the most fouled players in the league\n\n-------\n\nWATFORD are my surprise tip to go down this season.\n\nI know that won't be a popular choice and that some people are saying they have bought well this summer, but I disagree.\n\nThey've put all their eggs in one basket with Andre Gray and I don't see it working. Burnley played two up front last season and he didn't score bundles of goals.\n\nI don't think Watford will play with two up front, and he might find goals even harder to come by as a result.\n\nHim going there could also be the end of Troy Deeney, and that would be a big miss. He's easily their best player and gives them that leadership on and off the pitch.I think selling him could be a bad move, but two into one don't go and if they play with one striker his number is up.\n\nMarco Silva brought a lot of players in but he did that at Hull in January too and they still got relegated.\n\nLook at who else they bought as well. Will Nathaniel Chalobah keep you up? He's never really played much for Chelsea so it'll be interesting to see how he does week in, week out.\n\nWill Hughes and Tom Cleverley are not exactly going to pull up trees, and they spent big on Richarlison, but who knows how good he'll be.\n\nInterview by Paul Brown", "timeCrawl": "21:06:00", "sim": 0.5372549295425415, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-11", "id": "8701149", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Yard,_Deck,_and_Table_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Yard, Deck, and Table Games", "id": 1063, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

that is the Premier League will kick off and launch nine months of sporting theatre that is arguably unmatched.\n\nAs the biggest competition of the biggest sport in the world, the Premier League attracts more eyeballs and dollars than any other, and after another off-season of wheeling and dealing, the landscape has taken shape ahead of the first game.\n\nThe rich remain rich, throwing money around haphazardly in search of the crucial and telling edge, the chasing pack have become more restless as they try to keep up, and the new boys have stars in their eyes and dreams of many campaigns ahead.\n\nAs ever, making predictions at the start of a Premier League season is a fool's game, so let's just sit back, take a deep breath and get our ducks in a row before the curtain is raised on the greatest show on earth.\n\nWe're still short of the heady days of the early-to-mid 2000's when Socceroos filled all corners of England's top division, but it is a relief to see some Australians preparing to play crucial roles at their clubs this season.\n\nAaron Mooy, formally of Melbourne City and the Western Sydney Wanderers, has settled permanently at Huddersfield Town having made a name for himself last season in the Championship.\n\nMooy is a fan's favourite and an important part of David Wagner's team. He's a crafty but combative midfield player, able to operate at the high intensity the manager demands, and will be a regular as the Terriers try to prolong their Premier League adventure.\n\nJoining fellow promoted team Brighton and Hove Albion is goalkeeper Mat Ryan, the man trusted between Australia's sticks for a few good years now. After time in Spain and Belgium, England will be Ryan's biggest test.\n\nBoth will have one eye on the World Cup in Russia next year, so all of us here at home should have an eye on their club performances too.\n\nPicking who wins the league this season is a near impossible task, but if you were to take a basic survey of who fans are tipping, it's likely Manchester City would top the list.\n\nAnother year under Pep Guardiola, a backline bolstered by the big-money acquisitions of keeper Ederson, Kyle Walker, Danilo and Benjamin Mendy and all the attacking flair we've come to expect have the blue half of Manchester at the top of the list.\n\nPerhaps the red half is the next-best bet. United has broken the bank to bring in Romelu Lukaku in the hope he can improve his all-round game while continuing to score goals in abundance, but it's the pick-up of Nemanja Matic that could unlock United's midfield and allow them to attack more freely.\n\nChelsea is the reigning champ, a title that hasn't sat well with many teams for the past few years, and the Blues will be hoping Alvaro Morata can acclimatise quickly enough to keep them at the top.\n\nTottenham's biggest obstacle could be the stadium in which it plays, with Wembley a temporary home while the new White Hart Lane is being completed. The wider expanses of Wembley contradict the tight pressing game Spurs favour, so it will be worth watching Tottenham with interest early in the campaign.\n\nYou can be sure Arsenal will always be there or thereabouts, but last year's fall out of the top four could be a sign of things to come. Alexandre Lacazette is an exciting signing, but all eyes remain on Alexis Sanchez. Arsenal's ambitions could be determined by the Chilean's final destination.\n\nAnd then there's Liverpool, back in the Champions League and filled with hope, but should Barcelona nab Phillipe Coutinho and Virgil Van Dijk not make the move from Southampton, can you really say they've improved enough to fight for top spot?\n\nSix teams will be convinced they can lift the trophy this season, but only one can. Every point will be precious over the course of the next 38 games.\n\nEverton will believe it can break into the above category, hoping an early-window spending spree will be enough. Jordan Pickford, Michael Keane and co definitely improve the team, and Wayne Rooney will (if nothing else) provide some winning experience, but is that enough to counter the loss of Lukaku's goals?\n\nLast season was a poor one for West Ham United, who will be hoping for a repeat of Slavan Bilic's first season rather than his second. Marco Arnautovic, Pablo Zabaleta and Javier Hernandez are all intriguing signings, and the expectation at the London Stadium is that a European chase is more likely than a relegation battle.\n\nLeicester too should be improved after a difficult post-glory season. Kelechi Iheanacho and Harry Maguire are clever pick ups, and there were signs at the end of last season that Craig Shakespeare can bring good things out of the once-brilliant Foxes.\n\nSouthampton is locked in another battle to keep its star player, but time and time again has proven resilient in such circumstances, and Bournemouth has gone from fairy tale story to embedded Premier League team to ambitious spender -- another top 10 finish is just the beginning of the Cherries' ambitions.\n\nThere are fears the top six has broken away for good, but that's not a feeling shared by many of these ambitious clubs.\n\nMooy's Huddersfield and Ryan's Brighton will naturally be facing a tough task in trying to stay up this season, with lack of Premier League experience counting against them, but that's not something Newcastle has to worry about.\n\nRafa Benitez's Magpies are back after a one-season absence, and will be expecting to make this stay a permanent one. The manager is getting antsy over the lack of incoming transfers, but the plan at Newcastle is for a steady rise up the table, not a return to the second division.\n\nSwansea scraped through last season, largely off the back of Gylfi Sigurdsson's brilliance, so what happens if he goes to Everton as many are expecting? The replacements will need to be more than solid or the Welsh side could be in strife.\n\nCrystal Palace has Frank de Boer for a manager now, which will bring about a change in play style for the Eagles. How quickly the Dutchman can get the team gelling will determine how dicey the campaign is.\n\nBurnley stayed up last season thanks to their excellent defence, but with Keane gone, repeating that effort will be awfully difficult. There is still time to plug the gaps in the transfer market, and that will need to be done.\n\nStoke? Arnautavic is gone, but the defence looks solid still, even more so now with Chelsea's Kurt Zouma on loan. Finding goals remains the challenge. Watford has a new manager in Marco Silva, which is certainly an exciting choice, but the Portuguese will have his hands full with a team that still needs work and at a club with a high turnover rate.\n\nIt's tight at the top, the bottom and everywhere in between.

If you pushed me, I'd lean a tiny bit towards City, at the moment. But again, a lot depends on the next three weeks and what happens during the rest of the transfer window. I think it'll be open - it's a very difficult season to predict.\"\n\nAsked why he felt that Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho had the edge over their title rivals, BT Sport presenter Lineker pointed to the mitigating circumstances hindering the title bids of the other four clubs in the traditional top six.\n\nHarder season\n\n\"With Chelsea, they've struggled to defend [their titles]. History tells us that. They've got Champions League football this season as well so it's going to be a lot harder for them.\n\n\"I'd have fancied Tottenham quite strongly if they didn't have to play at Wembley.\n\n\"With Arsenal, I don't see them being much stronger than they were last season. They've brought in a striker and one or two others but I think top four for them would be a reasonable effort.\n\n\"And Liverpool, let's see where Philippe Coutinho goes and whether they get [Southampton's Virgil] van Dijk. That'd make a big difference for them. So at the minute, I think it's quite difficult to predict but if you pushed me, I'd go with one of the Manchester clubs.\"\n\nGolden boot\n\nLineker, who left Tottenham to join Nagoya Grampus Eight just months before the inception of the Premier League, was speaking at BT Sport's Premier League launch event.\n\nHe won the Golden Boot three times in his career - a feat bettered only by Thierry Henry and Jimmy Greaves since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nWhen quizzed about whether Spurs' Harry Kane, the league's top goalscorer two years in a row, might equal Lineker's tally this season, he again cited Tottenham's temporary Wembley home as a reason for doubt.\n\n\"Spurs are not at White Hart Lane this season, so that will probably make a difference to Harry Kane.\"\n\nOn Kane's rivals, Lineker added: \"[Manchester City's Sergio] \u00adAguero is always going to [score goals] and [Romelu] Lukaku will have to be close if Manchester United are to be successful. It will be interesting to see if Morata can fill the boots of [Diego] Costa. He has got the ability but his goalscoring record is not quite so impressive.\"\n\nBT Sport is where the best in sport go head to head, bringing you live coverage of the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and Europa League, Aviva Premiership, European Champions Cup and Challenge Cup, The Ashes, Boxing, UFC, NBA and MotoGP.

This is the age of the full-back - and that says a lot. For years full-backs were scorned as players who were not defensively sound enough to play in the middle of the back four nor technically good enough to play in midfield - \"Nobody,\" as Jamie Carragher has observed, \"grows up wanting to be Gary Neville\" - but this summer an astonishing amount of money has been spent on them. Most of the money, admittedly, has been splurged by Manchester City, who made Kyle Walker the most expensive defender in history at \u00a350m then bought a back-up in Danilo for \u00a326.5m before breaking their own record to sign Benjamin Mendy for \u00a352m.\n\nThis is not just a Premier League phenomenon. Barcelona and Real Madrid have spent more than \u00a326m on full-backs, while Milan have picked up a pair for the better part of \u00a350m. But it is a phenomenon centred on City, where Pep Guardiola, having chosen not to augment his four thirtysomething full-backs last season, has swung to the opposite extreme. In City's outlay on full-backs, three trends meet: Chelsea's success with a back three last season has brought the lateral centre-stage; English clubs are spending mind-boggling amounts of money; and City, perhaps frustrated at how last season turned out, are spending (or, at least, have spent) the most of the lot.\n\nBut it is the overall figures that are most eye-catching. Romelu Lukaku for \u00a375m. \u00c1lvaro Morata for \u00a358m. Alexandre Lacazette for \u00a346m. Bernardo Silva for \u00a343.6m. Ti\u00e9mou\u00e9 Bakayoko for \u00a339.7m. Mohamed Salah for \u00a336.9m. Ederson for \u00a334.9m. Victor Lindelof for \u00a331m. These are not normal figures. These are not prices that have undergone the usual process of inflation; it may be, as Daniel Levy has said, that they are unsustainable. This is a market in which Jordan Pickford, an uncapped 23-year-old goalkeeper who has played 31 Premier League games (most of them very well, admittedly), can move for \u00a325m with barely an eyebrow being raised.\n\nWhether the prices are unjustifiable or immoral depends on perspective, but looking at the flurry of \u00a330m, \u00a340m and \u00a350m deals, it doesn't take a great cynic to wonder whether there might not be some sort of mass hysteria at work. Is this a bubble just waiting to pop? Will there come a day on which someone thinks: \"\u00a350m for Kyle Walker? What were we doing?\" and the market collapses, vindicating the caution of Levy and, to a lesser extent, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger?\n\nThere are reasons for concern. Sky's rebranding of its sports channels comes in response to falling viewing figures last season. Illegal streaming is a major problem, so significant that more than half those surveyed by the Football Supporters' Federation in July admitted to using a Kodi box - more than had a BT subscription. Nonetheless, the expectation is for the next broadcast deal, which will come into force in 2019\u201120, to be even larger than the present one, driven by a significant increase in overseas rights. The Premier League may be coming to the top of the market but it is not there just yet.\n\nPerhaps we get the league we deserve. English football in the 1920s was characterised by innovation and pragmatism as the flux created by the first world war gave managerial opportunities to a class of people who had previously been excluded from such positions and who concerned themselves less with playing in the right way than with winning, because that was what guaranteed an income. The result was increasing use of the offside trap and ultimately, in response to that, an epochal change in the offside law. Or England's 6-3 defeat by Hungary in 1953, followed three years later by the Suez crisis, creating an atmosphere of imperial decline that led to introspection, a questioning of tradition and the creative wave of the 60s, of which Alf Ramsey's radical development of 4-4-2 and the World Cup win were an incongruous part.\n\nFootball is a part of culture, a reflection of the wider world - and that image is not a comfortable one. Ours is a society in which the people's game has led to the extraordinary enrichment of a tiny few, in which we pay for our tickets and our satellite subscriptions, handing more and more money over to billionaires, and gawp when the amounts are relayed back to us via ridiculous transfer fees, salaries and agents' commissions.\n\nNot only do few seem to be appalled by the preposterousness of it all but there is an odd sense that for some fans this is the most enjoyable part of the season, when messiahs loom behind every contorted meme announcing a new deal and the game exists as pure, unsullied potential. The high point of Mesut \u00d6zil's Arsenal career remains the day he signed. Far rather that, far rather the soap opera of agents and whispers, swoops and rumours, tactical projection and imagined combinations, the idealised simulacrum of the game, than the football itself. Behind those falling Sky figures a suspicion lurks that 90 minutes of play is too long to hold the modern attention span.\n\nYet unsettling as the nonsense of summer is, this is another season rich with promise. The fleet of new signings are part of that. This is what the Premier League is best at: turning the generation of cash and its expenditure into a spectator sport in itself. This remains the league of superstar managers and, if last season never quite ignited, that in a sense has only whetted the appetite for this campaign.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mourinho's season was salvaged by the Europa League and Guardiola's by a third-place finish, but neither really impressed in their first campaigns at their new clubs. The expected Rumble by the Irwell never quite came to pass, both too troubled by their own side's failings - one couldn't score; the other couldn't defend - to be able to spend too much time needling. For this season that adds jeopardy. Neither club, having invested so much in appointing them, were going to sack their manager last season; this season they might.\n\nSince joining Porto, Mourinho has always won the league in his second season at a club. There was little in 2016-17 to suggest he can do so again and become only the fourth manager ever to win the league with Manchester United, a club that have overwhelmed each of their leaders in the past century other than Matt Busby and Alex Ferguson - but the way they dragged themselves to the Europa League offers encouragement. The signing of Lukaku should help with the dispatching of the lesser clubs who so often frustrated them last season but the fear nags that football has moved on and Mourinho, energy sapped and charm exhausted, is struggling to keep up. Few managers, after all, have lasted more than a decade at the very top.\n\nThere is pressure too on Guardiola, all the more so now that his reaction to last season's failure has been an extraordinary spree. Does juego de posici\u00f3n have any place in the harum-scarum world of the Premier League?\n\nElsewhere, can J\u00fcrgen Klopp's high\u2011tempo philosophy prosper over a full season at Liverpool? Can Wenger survive another year with Arsenal? Can Mauricio Pochettino keep his young Spurs players invested in his project, even when they could be earning in some cases \u00a35m more a season elsewhere? And what of Everton, expectations raised by spending unthinkable before Farhad Moshiri's takeover?\n\nAnd then there's Antonio Conte, seemingly frustrated by his club's transfer policy, who last season outshone them all to win the title and offered a new tactical template. Has he another trick to pull at Chelsea? It was, after all, his deployment of the 3-4-2-1 system that confirmed the importance of full-backs as attacking players, he who provided the structural underpinning for a world in which a club see their best way of reacting to a poor season as splurging \u00a3130m on a position once regarded as an afterthought.\n\nThe Guardian Sport\n\nJonathan Wilson\n\nMore Posts\n\nFacebook Twitter Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Related", "timeCrawl": "09:04:00", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "-02-01", "date": "-03-04", "textStart": 7541, "amb": false, "textEnd": 7548}], "location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8893659", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "id": 523, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "id": 822, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"09:56:00", "isDuplicate": false, "body": "London: Ending the 2016-17 Premier League campaign above north-London rivals Arsenal for the first time in 22 years was more of a proud achievement than finishing as runners-up for Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nBut the one thing the north-London club has succeeded in proving to the other top 5 clubs - Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool - is that money always does not guarantee success and it looks club chairman Daniel Levy will stick by this motto for the upcoming season as well.\n\nIf we are to compile a table based solely on points scored in the last two Premier League seasons, it's Spurs who take the cherry. Unfortunately, that has resulted in no silverware whatsoever with the likes of Chelsea and Leicester City taking the crown as champions.\n\nWhat looks good:\n\nBelieve it or not, Spurs have the most balanced side in the league and the squad looks exciting the way Mauricio Pochettino has moulded a team that suits his playing style.\n\nOver the years they've managed to fend off interest in key players and with a blend of young players in the current lot, the team will only get better over time. A humongous chunk of their goals has been possible due to the likes Dele Alli, Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen who will once again be entrusted with the same responsibility. Pochettino's men also have the meanest defence in the league, conceding only 26 goals - the lowest last season.\n\nComing to individual honours, Harry Kane bagged the Golden Boot award while Dele Alli was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season. So the signs look promising.\n\nWhat does not:\n\nSpurs' redevelopment of the White Hart Lane seems to have hampered their progress in the summer transfer window. While rival clubs like Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal and Everton have undergone a huge spending spree, including new comers such as Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town who have broken the bank, Spurs are the only team who are yet to sign anyone.\n\nPreviously, defender Danny Rose even expressed his frustration of bagging no silverware and that the club should a sign a player whom people do not have to Google search.\n\nAt a cost of \u00a345 million (biggest fee for a defender before Manchester City signed Benjamin Mendy for \u00a352m), the club has dug their own grave by directly strengthening a Premier League rival.\n\nPochettino's men also have a woeful record at the Wembley Stadium and future looms over how well the team could replicate last season's heroics.\n\nKey signings:\n\nDespite splashing the cash last summer, Spurs are yet to sign a player. Everton's Ross Barkley has been linked with a move in recent weeks as the Toffees are set to rope in Swansea's playmaker-in-chief Gylfi Sigurdsson.\n\nDepartures:\n\nAfter a long transfer saga, Spurs let Kyle Walker leave for Manchester City for a reported sum of \u00a345m, \u00a350m including add-ons.\n\nSchalke have handed Nabil Bentaleb a permanent contract following an impressive loan spell. Clinton N'Jie has joined Lyon, Federico Fazio has signed for Roma and Luke McGee has moved to Portsmouth for more playing time.\n\nTactical view:\n\nDespite sticking to a standard 4-2-3-1 during his initial years, Pochettino has switched to a 3-4-2-1 system mainly due to the addition of ball-winner Victor Wanyama.\n\nThis has enabled the Argentine boss to add stability to his three-man defence with the inclusion of Eric Dier, with full-backs Ben Davies and Kieran Trippier marauding up and down the flanks.\n\nWhat gives the team an edge in the opposition half is the number of bodies going forward. The front three of Alli, Eriksen and Kane are assigned with the responsibility of high pressing, with the former two cutting-inside and playing through the lines. Meanwhile, the full-backs take over the wings and whip delicious crosses into the box.\n\nA trick to dismantle the opposition defence involves playing accurate and quick passes in tight spaces and looking for openings.\n\nPlayers to watch out for:\n\nPremier League top scorer Harry Kane will once again lead the line for Spurs and on his day, the Englishman can batter even the best of defences. Kieran Trippier impressed during the latter stages of the season, creating the same chances as Kyle Walker despite playing fewer games.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nInjury to any of their key players could prove to be nasty; therefore the team needs to reinforce a few back-ups in vital positions. No business in the transfer market could see the team left behind by the likes of Chelsea, Man City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United.\n\nRegardless of wherever the club finish, the priority should be to achieve silverware. Guess how frustrating it could be if Walker tastes glory while the team get their hands on nothing (irrespective of the goals and the star-studded displays)?\n\nThings won't be easy for the Lilywhites but the team needs to acquire something tangible to remind themselves of the stable progress under Pochettino's era.", "timeCrawl": "16:13:00", "sim": 0.4823529422283173, "extractedDates": [{"dateEnd": "-03-01", "date": "-04-02", "textStart": 3160, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3167}, {"dateEnd": "-02-01", "date": "-03-04", "textStart": 3223, "amb": false, "textEnd": 3230}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8938174", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Despite a CV boasting three titles with both Barcelona and Bayern Munich, his experience as a manager -- however impressive -- failed to translate into immediate success at Manchester City.\n\nAmong his first-year foibles, the Catalan's decision to jettison goalkeeper Joe Hart in favour of the erratic Claudio Bravo was certainly his most high-profile, and it dispelled the notion that \"playing from the back\" would work as well for him in England as it did in Spain and Germany.\n\nThe 46-year-old manager also learned that many of the players he inherited at Etihad Stadium were simply not good enough to function with his preferred positional variance, and he has admitted to being caught off-guard initially by the aerial nature of English football.\n\n\"Many times the ball is more in the air than the grass,\" he remarked back in December. \"And I have to adapt.\"\n\nHe'll have learned a lot from City's third-place finish last term, and he'll have long since considered how he and his team can improve. Some of his previously held philosophies will have been thrown out; others will have been reconsidered and tweaked.\n\nThe purchase of Benfica goalkeeper Ederson, for example, shows he recognizes his previous mistake between the sticks. He also has unloaded the likes of Pablo Zabaleta, Gael Clichy and Jesus Navas, and restocked with Kyle Walker, Benjamin Mendy and Bernardo Silva.\n\nThis season's City will be considerably better than last season's, which is why this columnist is tipping this team to win the league.\n\nIf nothing else, it would be foolish to bet that Guardiola -- one of the sport's leading intellectuals -- won't have the Premier League figured out in a second attempt.\n\nFollowing is a complete top-to-bottom prediction, with a line of explanation accompanying each club.\n\n2. Manchester United. Ander Herrera-Nemanja Matic-Paul Pogba is the best midfield trio in the English top flight.\n\n3. Chelsea. Losing Matic was a blow, but Tiemoue Bakayoko is a capable replacement -- as is Alvaro Morata, should Diego Costa depart.\n\n4. Liverpool. Even if the Reds keep Philippe Coutinho, their defence isn't good enough to contend for the title.\n\n5. Arsenal. Look for Granit Xhaka to have an excellent campaign, but the Gunners won't be a Champions League team again in the Arsene Wenger era.\n\n6. Tottenham. This side is one or two injuries away from disaster.\n\n7. Everton. In acquiring Wayne Rooney, Michael Keane, Jordan Pickford and Davy Klaasen this team has done some of the best business of the summer.\n\n8. West Ham. New signings Hart, Marko Arnautovic and Javier Hernandez will have the Hammers pushing for a European place.\n\n9. Southampton. Prying Mario Lemina from Juventus was impressive, but hanging onto Virgil van Dijk would be even more so.\n\n10. Crystal Palace. Timothy Fosu-Mensah and Ruben Loftus-Cheek are decent loan signings, but more transfer activity is needed.\n\n11. Leicester. Having stabilized under Craig Shakespeare, the 2015-16 champions can expect to finish comfortably mid-table.\n\n12. Stoke. Mark Hughes might be the manager on the shortest leash.\n\n13. Bournemouth. Asmir Begovic and Jermain Defoe are terrific signings, and Lewis Cook is coming off U-20 World Cup victory.\n\n16. Newcastle. The team is good enough to stay up, but it needs to sign a striker with Premier League credentials.\n\n17. Swansea. The club's survival depends on Tammy Abraham's ability to pick up where he left off at Bristol City.\n\n18. Brighton & Hove Albion. You almost hope this side stays up just for Chris Hughton, who is one of the finest people in football.\n\n19. Burnley. The Clarets barely survived relegation in the spring and since have sold Gray and Michael Keane.\n\n20. Huddersfield. It's straight back down for the Terriers, who haven't played top-flight football since 1972.", "timeCrawl": "12:36:00", "sim": 0.47843137383461, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8791552", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "id": 673, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy/Football", "id": 829, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

"isDuplicate": false, "body": "The Premier League returned with bang as Arsenal staged a thrilling fightback to beat Leicester, champions Chelsea suffered a shock defeat against Burnley and Romelu Lukaku marked his Manchester United debut with a brace in their rout of West Ham\n\nHere AFP Sport looks at five things we learned from the opening weekend of the new season:\n\nProblems mount for Conte\n\nThroughout a turbulent close-season, Antonio Conte had grown increasingly fraught as Chelsea failed to deliver his transfer targets while allowing several players to leave. The Chelsea boss claimed defending the title would be the toughest test of his career and Conte's worst fears were confirmed in Saturday's stunning 3-2 home defeat against Burnley. Rocked by Gary Cahill's early red card, Chelsea crumbled as Burnley scored three times in the first half with hardly any resistance from the lacklustre champions. Goals from Alvaro Morata and David Luiz put a flattering gloss on the score, but, with Cesc Fabregas also sent off, Conte's already depleted squad will be even more under-manned due to suspensions. \"We lost our composure. We have to improve a lot on this aspect because there was the rest of the game to try to do our best,\" he grumbled.\n\nPerfectionist Guardiola not satisfied\n\nAfter Manchester City's trophyless first season under boss Pep Guardiola, the Spaniard vowed to learn from his failed English exam. Guardiola's main takeaway from City's flop last term was his side must be more ruthless in the penalty area while matching their rivals' work rate. Saturday's 2-0 win at Brighton was a step in the right direction, but the City boss warned his players he still isn't satisfied. Sergio Aguero made the breakthrough after 70 minutes and Lewis Dunk's own goal doubled City's advantage five minutes later, yet Guardiola said: \"We have to learn to attack better. \"Last season we ran a lot but in the boxes, we were not good. Hopefully, in the future we can be more accurate.\"\n\nMan United look like title contenders\n\nIt is very early days, but Manchester United's emphatic 4-0 victory over West Ham United suggested they may be about to mount a first serious title challenge since Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013. Jose Mourinho's side often dominated their opponents last season without being able to make it count, but it was a completely different story at a sun-kissed Old Trafford as a team spearheaded by new striker Romelu Lukaku put West Ham to the sword. Lukaku scored twice, either side of half-time, before late goals from substitute Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba completed United's most convincing opening-weekend win since a 5-1 demolition of Fulham in August 2006.\n\nArsenal's defence is a mess\n\nGoals from substitutes Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud earned Arsenal a thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester City, but there was no glossing over their defensive problems. Leicester's first and third goals came from simple corner routines, while their second stemmed from a loose pass by Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka. Arsenal finished the game with midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at right-back, right-back Hector Bellerin at left-back and two left-backs -- Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac -- in central defence. Laurent Koscielny remains suspended for next weekend's trip to Stoke City and Gabriel is still sidelined, but Shkodran Mustafi and Per Mertesacker could return to give the defence a more conventional -- and solid -- appearance.\n\nLiverpool might not miss Coutinho\n\nLiverpool made a frustrating start to the season, denied victory in a 3-3 draw at Watford after Miguel Britos's stoppage-time leveller for the hosts was allowed to stand despite an apparent offside. At the other end of the pitch, however, Philippe Coutinho was not missed. The Brazil playmaker, absent due to a back injury, is the subject of strong interest from Barcelona, which has been met equally firmly by Liverpool's owners Fenway Sports Group, who are determined not to sell him. But Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and new signing Mohamed Salah all scored and with Adam Lallana still to return from injury and Divock Origi, Daniel Sturridge and Dominic Solanke also at Jurgen Klopp's disposal, if Coutinho were to leave, Liverpool might not miss him as much as their fans fear.", "timeCrawl": "17:47:00", "sim": 0.4745098054409027, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2006-08-", "textStart": 2655, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2666}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8948860", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News_and_Media", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/News and Media", "id": 539, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "id": 645, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

loses its mind over Neymar's move to Paris Saint-Germain and FC Barcelona's subsequent scramble to replace him, the most competitive league in the game opens its season Friday. Some of the world's top teams may reside outside England, but the Premier League is still the sport's marquee league for both its rich history and accessibility.\n\nAn insane amount of spending across the board has marked this offseason, and the teams in play for the coveted league title have each shaken up their rosters. That said, a looming set of questions remains as the soccer season finally returns.\n\nAfter one of the greatest seasons in league history -- one that saw Chelsea win a record 30 games and post a blistering 30-3-5 record -- Chelsea have retooled in some ways and lost strength in others. In short, no, they cannot and will not repeat.\n\nNot only do the Blues lack the depth and firepower to compete in both the Premier League and Champions League, their talent has not gotten any younger -- or more plentiful, for that matter. Sure, Chelsea has added \u00c1lvaro Morata, Bakayoko and Antonio Rudiger, but they also lost Diego Costa, Nemanja Mati\u0107, John Terry, Bertrand Traore and Nathan Ake.\n\nWhile Morata is a flashy, big-name signing, he is unproven and lacks the clout that Costa previously boasted. In fact, much of the soccer Twitterverse roared with laughter as Morata put forth an atrocious penalty attempt in Sunday's community shield loss against Arsenal.\n\nWhile Chelsea is still a good team and will undoubtedly be a contender, down the stretch, they have neither the pieces nor the depth to clinch the title.\n\nManager Pep Guardiola has spent a total of \u00a3123.5 million this transfer window on three players alone, and despite my predisposition toward (Sheikh) Man(sour) City, they have done a first-class job this summer. Signing three quality defenders in Kyle Walker, Danilo and Benjamin Mendy, City has bolstered their weakest area of the pitch.\n\nNow, sporting a potentially world-class defense, City has much more breathing room to play the ball forward to an attacking force that features Sergio Aguero, Wilfried Bony, Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva and Raheem Sterling as well as wonder kids Gabriel Jesus and Leroy San\u00e9.\n\nAfter having a down year, at least according to pundits and fans, City still finished third in the league with the third most goals scored. Expect more of the same -- and probably even better -- this season.\n\nCan Tottenham keep growing?\n\nYes, yes and yes. A thousand times yes. Tottenham Hotspur posted the best goal differential in the entire league last year while scoring the most goals and allowing the fewest. While Spurs lost Kyle Walker to Manchester City, they retain a world-class defense and one of the most threatening forward pairings in the game today: Harry Kane and Dele Alli.\n\nKane took home the Golden Boot after scoring an EPL-high 29 goals, and Dele Alli -- just 21 years of age -- put back 18 himself.\n\nMoreover, all of their major midfielders are hitting their primes, meaning only more cohesive build-up play and excellent passes to Kane and Alli.\n\nWhile pundits and fans alike have slotted Tottenham away in the third or fourth spot, I believe they will win the Premier League outright.\n\nAny team that finishes in the top seven is either guaranteed a European competition the following season or earns a chance to make one. This system makes the top seven crucial -- with a top-four finish earning a Champions League berth -- and I truly foresee quite the shakeup this season up top. As with most of my sports predictions, I will most likely be egregiously wrong.

returned with bang as Arsenal staged a thrilling fightback to beat Leicester, champions Chelsea suffered a shock defeat against Burnley and Romelu Lukaku marked his Manchester United debut with a brace in their rout of West Ham.\n\nHere we looks at five things we learned from the opening weekend of the new season:\n\nProblems mount for Conte\n\nThroughout a turbulent close-season, Antonio Conte had grown increasingly fraught as Chelsea failed to deliver his transfer targets, while allowing several players to leave. The Chelsea boss claimed defending the title would be the toughest test of his career and Conte's worst fears were confirmed in Saturday's stunning 3-2 home defeat against Burnley. Rocked by Gary Cahill's early red card, Chelsea crumbled as Burnley scored three times in the first half with hardly any resistence from the lacklustre champions. Goals from Alvaro Morata and David Luiz put a flattering gloss on the score, but, with Cesc Fabregas also sent off, Conte's already depleted squad will be even more under-manned due to suspensions. \"We lost our composure. We have to improve a lot on this aspect because there was the rest of the game to try to do our best,\" he grumbled.\n\nPerfectionist Guardiola not satisfied\n\nAfter Manchester City's trophyless first season under boss Pep Guardiola, the Spaniard vowed to learn from his failed English exam. Guardiola's main takeaway from City's flop last term was his side must be more ruthless in the penalty area, while matching their rivals' work rate. Saturday's 2-0 win at Brighton was a step in the right direction, but the City boss warned his players he still isn't satisfied. Sergio Aguero made the breakthrough after 70 minutes and Lewis Dunk's own goal doubled City's advantage five minutes later, yet Guardiola said: \"We have to learn to attack better. \"Last season we ran a lot but in the boxes we were not good. Hopefully in the future we can be more accurate.\"\n\nMan United look like title contenders\n\nIt is very early days, but Manchester United's emphatic 4-0 victory over West Ham United suggested they may be about to mount a first serious title challenge since Alex Ferguson's retirement in 2013. Jose Mourinho's side often dominated their opponents last season without being able to make it count, but it was a completely different story at a sun-kissed Old Trafford as a team spearheaded by new striker Romelu Lukaku put West Ham to the sword. Lukaku scored twice, either side of half-time, before late goals from substitute Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba completed United's most convincing opening-weekend win since a 5-1 demolition of Fulham in August 2006.\n\nArsenal's defence is a mess\n\nGoals from substitutes Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud earned Arsenal a thrilling 4-3 win over Leicester City, but there was no glossing over their defensive problems. Leicester's first and third goals came from simple corner routines, while their second stemmed from a loose pass by Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka. Arsenal finished the game with midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain at right-back, right-back Hector Bellerin at left-back and two left-backs -- Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac -- in central defence. Laurent Koscielny remains suspended for next weekend's trip to Stoke City and Gabriel is still sidelined, but Shkodran Mustafi and Per Mertesacker could return to give the defence a more conventional -- and solid -- appearance.\n\nLiverpool might not miss Coutinho\n\nLiverpool made a frustrating start to the season, denied victory in a 3-3 draw at Watford after Miguel Britos's stoppage-time leveller for the hosts was allowed to stand despite an apparent offside. At the other end of the pitch, however, Philippe Coutinho was not missed. The Brazil playmaker, absent due to a back injury, is the subject of strong interest from Barcelona, which has been met equally firmly by Liverpool's owners Fenway Sports Group, who are determined not to sell him. But Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and new signing Mohamed Salah all scored and with Adam Lallana still to return from injury and Divock Origi, Daniel Sturridge and Dominic Solanke also at Jurgen Klopp's disposal, if Coutinho were to leave, Liverpool might not miss him as much as their fans fear.", "timeCrawl": "18:07:00", "sim": 0.5176470875740051, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2006-08-", "textStart": 2649, "amb": false, "textEnd": 2660}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8950832", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "id": 645, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Distance_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Distance Learning", "id": 724, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}], "page": 1, "pages": 30, "totalResults": 30}}}

Why does Capital struggle with flooding?", "body": "People try to pull a two-wheeler from being swept away by rainwater near Old Rajinder Nagar during the rain, in New Delhi, on Wednesday. PTI\n\nThe rain gods unleashed their fury on India's capital on Wednesday night (July 31), bringing Delhi and its adjoining areas of National Capital Region to its knees. Heavy rainfall submerged the streets, caused flights to be delayed and even death and destruction came calling.\n\nIn light of such a situation, the Delhi government announced that all schools would remain shut today -- on August 1. Moreover, India's weatherman, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), has issued a red alert warning, urging citizens to stay at home and avoid travelling.\n\nBut what caused this rain fury? And how bad is the destruction caused by it? Here's what we know so far.\n\nA cloudburst?\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Delhi turned into a watery mess after it experienced heavy rainfall in a short period of time. The capital recorded more than a hundred millimetres of rainfall in one hour, leading to waterlogging in several areas of the national capital and prompting the weather office to issue a 'red' warning.\n\nAs per the IMD's Automatic Weather Station (AWS) network, the Pragati Maidan observatory in central Delhi recorded 112.5 mm of rainfall in one hour.\n\nIncidentally, the IMD describes extreme rainfall in a short period of time, specifically 100 mm of rainfall within an hour, as a \"cloud burst\". However, officials haven't termed this rainfall to be the impact of a cloud burst.\n\nBut then what caused this sudden, heavy rainfall? The IMD around 7 pm on Wednesday said on X: \"Clouds have converged over Delhi from all four sectors. Widespread light/moderate rainfall with isolated intense to very intense spell (3-5 cm/hr) likely over Delhi during the next two hours.\"\n\nLater, the IMD also forecast that the rainy conditions would continue until August 5.\n\nHow bad was the rainfall?\n\nTorrential rainfall unleashed chaos in the national capital on Wednesday, inundating large parts of the city. This led to unending traffic snarls, and people being stranded on roads that resembled rivers.\n\nIn Ghazipur, located in east Delhi, a woman and her three-year-old son fell into a waterlogged drain and drowned. The police in its report identified the victims as Tanuja and Priyansh, adding that they were out to buy household items when they slipped and fell into the drain. The incident occurred near the Khoda Colony area, where the roadside drain was under construction.\n\nAccording to reports, three others in Gurugram aalso died in the deluge, taking the death toll to five.\n\nThe heavy rainfall also led to a house collapse in north Delhi's Sabji Mandi area near Robin Cinema, injuring one person. Authorities also reported a wall collapse in southwest Delhi's Vasant Kunj, in which a woman was injured.\n\nIn Pragati Maidan area, officials recorded 112.5 mm of rain within an hour, leading to waterlogging and a mess. The IMD also recorded 79.2 mm of rainfall between 5.30 pm and 8.30 pm at Safdarjung. In the same timeframe, Mayur Vihar saw 119 mm of rainfall, while Delhi University saw 77.5 mm of rainfall, Pusa saw 66.5 mm and Palam recorded 43.7 mm of rainfall.\n\nWaterlogging in Lutyens' Delhi caused bad traffic snarls, with people complaining on social media about the roads and the watery mess. Visuals from many places across Delhi showed vehicles wading through waterlogged roads while traffic police personnel tried to manage vehicular movement.\n\nOne image shared online also showed rainwater gushing into the Press Club of India, where people were seen sitting in knee-deep water. In other parts of the capital, visuals showed water gushing into showrooms and restaurants. Some parts of Delhi even lost power in the rains, with many residents being forced to sit in darkness for hours.\n\nIncidentally, Old Rajinder Nagar, where students were protesting the death of three UPSC aspirants due to flooding in a coaching institute basement, was under knee-deep water.\n\nThe weather also affected air traffic. At least 10 flights scheduled to land at the Delhi airport were diverted -- eight to Jaipur and two to Lucknow -- due to inclement weather conditions. Airlines also warned of the possibility of more flight disruptions.\n\nThe downpour and the subsequent water mess prompted Delhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena to ask officers to remain on alert. Meanwhile, Delhi Education Minister Atishi announced that all schools in the city will remain closed on Thursday. \"In light of the very heavy rainfall this evening and the forecast of heavy rainfall tomorrow, all schools both government and private will remain closed on August 1,\" she posted on X.\n\nWhy does Delhi struggle with flooding?\n\nWednesday's rain caught Delhi unaware, as they have been witnessing a dry spell and sweltering heat. However, Wednesday's rain chaos isn't new to the capital. Delhi and the surrounding NCR region battles with flooding almost every year.\n\nBut what is the reason for this mess? Experts note that Wednesday's rain was torrential and unexpected. It was, as they say, too much, too soon. As per records, parts of the capital saw over 100 mm of rain within an hour.\n\nBut it's not just the unprecedented rain that leads to this flooding. Unchecked and ill-thought-out urban expansion is also a reason for Delhi struggling. According to data from NASA's Earth Observatory, the geographic size of Delhi almost doubled from 1991 to 2011.\n\nHowever, this expansion hasn't taken the area's topography into consideration. Manu Bhatnagar, principal director, Natural Heritage Division, INTACH, explained to Indian Express, \"Topography determines drainage patterns. If one looks at Delhi's historic cities -- from Tughlakabad, Mehrauli, and Shahjahanabad to Civil Lines, New Delhi, and the Cantonment area -- all were carefully selected, and built on higher ground. In Delhi's villages too, the centre of the village would always be five to six metres higher than the village periphery.\"\n\nThis allowed rainwater to drain out. But as the city has expanded, not enough thought has gone behind the building with regards to the land's drainage capacities.\n\nThe constant construction also doesn't help. Concretisation leaves little room for rainwater to percolate into the soil, leading to flooding.\n\nThe constant encroachment on the Yamuna floodplains is also to blame for Delhi's flooding woes. Lakhs of people live on the floodplains of the Yamuna in the city, several of whom have converted the area to agricultural fields to make a livelihood. According to a report by the Centre for Science and Environment, the Yamuna floodplain had over 600 wetlands and waterbodies, but \"more than 60 per cent of them are without water, making the city prone to flooding.\" The report further states that \"the river-fed water bodies in the Yamuna floodplain are disconnected from the river because of embankments.\"", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

The incident occurred near the Khoda Colony area, where the roadside drain was under construction.\n\nThe heavy downpour also led to a house collapse in north Delhi's Sabji Mandi area near Robin Cinema, injuring one person. In another incident in southwest Delhi's Vasant Kunj, a woman was injured in a wall collapse.\n\nThe inclement weather also hit air traffic. At least 10 flights scheduled to land at the Delhi airport were diverted -- eight to Jaipur and two to Lucknow -- due to inclement weather conditions. Airlines also warned of the possibility of more flight disruptions.\n\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city's primary weather station Safdarjung recorded 79.2 mm of rainfall between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm; Mayur Vihar 119 mm; Delhi University 77.5 mm; Pusa 66.5 mm; and the Palam observatory 43.7 mm.\n\nDelhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena said he has asked officers to remain on alert.\n\n\"Apart from ensuring minimum inconvenience to people in general, they are advised to specifically address issues at sites prone to waterlogging, including coaching centres,\" he said in the post on 'X'.\n\nThe traffic situation was especially chaotic on roads in Lutyens' Delhi and those leading to Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad.\n\nOld Rajinder Nagar, where students were protesting the death of three UPSC aspirants due to flooding in a coaching institute basement, was under knee-deep water. In Connaught Place, water gushed into many showrooms and restaurants.\n\nWidespread waterlogging prompted the traffic police to issue an advisory, asking commuters to avoid certain roads.\n\nThey said vehicular movement was hit on the carriageway from Moolchand towards Chirag Delhi, both carriageways on Anuvrat Marg, Outer Ring Road, Syama Prasad Mukherjee Marg and Mahatma Gandhi Marg among other key roads.\n\nThe traffic police also suggested alternative routes and highlighted diversions imposed for commuters to consider given the waterlogging.\n\nMultiple areas, including in Kashmere Gate, Karol Bagh and Pragati Maidan, were marooned following the heavy downpour.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi said it received four complaints about waterlogging and three calls about fallen trees from different parts of Delhi. Power cuts were also reported across the city.\n\nIn Old Delhi's Daryaganj area, the boundary wall of a school collapsed upon cars parked outside while the road beneath caved in.\n\nIn South Delhi's Chhatarpur area, slippers were seen floating on waterlogged streets as vehicles drove by.\n\nThere was chaos in the Pragati Maidan tunnel as well due to waterlogging. The ITO intersection, the Dhaula Kuan area and the road towards the airport witnessed traffic snarls due to inundation.\n\nRainwater gushed into the Press Club of India, where people were seen sitting in knee-deep water in a purported photo shared online.\n\nWith the BJP slamming the ruling AAP in Delhi over the situation and accusing it of negligence and mismanagement, Atishi said the city government and the MCD were maintaining a close watch.\n\n\"There has been very heavy rainfall in Delhi in the last two hours. Delhi Govt and MCD are maintaining a close watch on low lying areas and vulnerable waterlogging locations, to ensure no untoward incident takes place,\" she said in another post on 'X'.\n\nThe national capital recorded a maximum temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius during the day.\n\nThe IMD has predicted a wet spell in the city till August 5.

The National Flash Flood Guidance Bulletin also included Delhi in its list of \"areas of concern\", it said. The weather office advised people to remain indoors, secure windows and doors, and refrain from unnecessary travel.\n\nAt least 10 flights scheduled to land at the Delhi airport were diverted -- eight to Jaipur and two to Lucknow -- due to inclement weather conditions. Airlines also warned of the possibility of more flight disruptions.\n\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city's primary weather station Safdarjung recorded 79.2 mm of downpour between 5:30 pm and 8:30 pm; Mayur Vihar 119 mm; Delhi University 77.5 mm; Pusa 66.5 mm; and the Palam observatory 43.7 mm.\n\nThe heavy downpour also led to a house collapse in north Delhi's Sabji Mandi area. While details of it were still awaited, the Delhi Fire Services said the house was located close to the Ghanta Ghar near Robin Cinema.\n\nFive fire tenders are at the spot, the department added.\n\nDelhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena said he has asked officers to remain on alert.\n\n\"Apart from ensuring minimum inconvenience to people in general, they are advised to specifically address issues at sites prone to waterlogging, including coaching centres,\" he said in the post on 'X'.\n\nWidespread waterlogging prompted the traffic police to issue an advisory, asking commuters to avoid certain roads.\n\nThey said vehicular movement was hit on the carriageway from Moolchand towards Chirag Delhi, both carriageways on Anuvrat Marg, Outer Ring Road, Syama Prasad Mukherjee Marg and Mahatma Gandhi Marg among other key roads.\n\nThe traffic police also suggested alternative routes and highlighted diversions imposed for commuters to consider given the waterlogging.\n\nVisuals showed waterlogged streets at Connaught Place and in the Kamla Nagar area near Delhi University's North Campus, besides vehicles wading through waterlogged roads in south Delhi's Qutub Minar area.\n\nMultiple areas, including in Lutyens' Delhi, Kashmere Gate, Karol Bagh and Pragati Maidan, were marooned following the heavy downpour. Old Rajinder Nagar, where students were protesting the death of three UPSC aspirants due to flooding in a coaching institute basement, was under knee-deep water.\n\nThe Municipal Corporation of Delhi said it received four complaints about waterlogging and three calls about fallen trees from different parts of Delhi.\n\nThe national capital recorded a maximum temperature of 37.8 degrees Celsius during the day.\n\nThe IMD has predicted a wet spell in the city till August 5.

As the capital continues to experience interruptions and traffic issues, water pumping operations are being carried out to alleviate the situation.\n\nDelhi NCR Waterlogging: Delhi was mauled by heavy rainfall on Wednesday, which caused extensive waterlogging and disruption in daily life. The Indian Meteorological Department issued a red alert, advising people to remain indoors unless necessary. It also advised avoiding areas prone to waterlogging to avoid risks.\n\nIMD Issues Orange Alert for Delhi\n\nThe red alert by IMD, valid till 8:30 am,. This has been followed by an orange alert for the next 24 hours. This precautionary measure is against the backdrop of continuous weather conditions that are likely to bring in moderate rainfall, thunderstorms, and lightning at several places over North Delhi, Central Delhi, New Delhi, South Delhi, South-East Delhi, East Delhi, and the National Capital Region in the next two hours. The weather agency predicted that this precipitation pattern would continue to August 5.\n\nHeavy Rainfall Leads to Widespread Waterlogging in Delhi\n\nHeavy rainfall soon had its effect in the city, as the city witnessed waterlogging in several areas of Delhi. The building of Institute of Town Planners India was inundated, and urgent pumping work started to drain out accumulated water. There were similar reports of waterlogging near major points like Mother Dairy, Ganesh Nagar, and Patparganj Road, which inconvenienced the commuters.\n\nTraffic Advisories Issued\n\nThe Delhi Police issued traffic advisories to help manage the impact of the waterlogging amidst challenging conditions. Even after clear skies this morning, residents found that waterlogged streets remain a problem. The IMD has forecasted intermittent showers for coming days, emphasizing the need for caution.\n\nIncessant rain has warned the residents of slippery roads, less visibility, and anomalies in traffic. Waterlogging in low-lying areas may continue to disrupt the city with continuous rainfall. The alerts issued by IMD prove that a cold diagnosis of the weather conditions becomes very important in being careful to get through the muddles of heavy rain.\n\nBuilding Collapse in Sabzi Mandi\n\nWith heavy rainfalls, a multi-storey building in the Sabzi Mandi area of Delhi collapsed last night. It was responded to by fire teams immediately with the deployment of five vehicles. One person trapped under the debris has been removed and admitted to Hindu Rao Hospital with serious injuries. Torrential rain has caused tragic fatalities across Delhi and NCR. A lady and her small son fell into an open drain in Ghazipur, East Delhi, and died. In Gurugram, three persons were electrocuted by a high-tension wire, while wall collapse in Dadri, Greater Noida, caused two fatalities. The inclement weather has caused heavy loss and damage all around the region.", "source": {"uri": "dnpindia.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNP INDIA"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Weather officials reported that while the intensity lessened after 8:30 pm on Wednesday, the rain persisted in battering most areas of Delhi until around 2:30 am when the clouds finally began to clear.\n\nFor Thursday, the weather office has predicted isolated drizzles to light rains across the city.\n\nIMD data from 8:30 am on Wednesday to 5:30 am on Thursday indicated that several stations, including Safdarjung -- which is representative of Delhi's weather -- had recorded 'heavy' rainfall.

Residents capture 'swimming pools', 'waterfalls' videos", "body": "Delhi and its adjoining National Capital Region (NCR) on Wednesday evening hit by an intense bout of rainfall, bringing both relief from the oppressive humidity and significant challenges due to waterlogging and traffic disruptions. In a dramatic display of nature's power, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported over 100 millimeters of rainfall in just one hour, leading to the issuance of a 'red' warning. This kind of extreme precipitation, often termed a \"cloud burst,\" resulted in severe waterlogging across various parts of the city. Many took to social media to share images of video or Delhi rains.\n\nThe IMD has forecast continued moderate to heavy rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms over the next few days. According to the IMD clouds converged over Delhi from all four sectors, leading to heavy rainfall. The department has advised residents to remain indoors where possible, secure windows and doors, and avoid unnecessary travel due to expected slippery roads and reduced visibility.\n\nMany airlines issued advisory to passengers traveling to and from Delhi, warning that flights may face delays due to the severe weather conditions. The airline has urged travelers to arrive early at the airport, as slow traffic and waterlogging could impact travel times. Passengers are advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport to avoid any last-minute surprises.\n\nThe heavy rainfall has led to widespread waterlogging, severely affecting Delhi's infrastructure and causing significant traffic issues. Several areas have been particularly hard hit:\n\nRohtak Road: This key route is heavily congested in both directions due to severe waterlogging and potholes. Travelers are advised to avoid the Mundka area and seek alternate routes to bypass the affected sections.\n\nRailway Under Bridges: Traffic diversions have been implemented on Ram Bagh Road and Azad Market due to waterlogging. Although efforts are underway to address these issues, commuters should check for the latest updates before traveling.\n\nZakhira Underpass and Ch. Fateh Singh Marg: Similar waterlogging issues have caused traffic disruptions at these locations. The Delhi Traffic Police has reported that the waterlogging has been cleared, but drivers are advised to remain cautious and follow the latest traffic advisories.\n\nMG Road: Traffic congestion is particularly severe in the carriageway from Andheria Mor towards Gurugram, compounded by the breakdown of a heavy transport vehicle. Commuters are advised to plan their trips with this in mind.\n\nThe ongoing Kanwar Yatra has further exacerbated traffic conditions in Delhi and surrounding areas. Traffic restrictions are in place on the carriageway from Kalindi Kunj to Noida, with one side reserved for Kanwariyas (pilgrims). This has led to heavy congestion at key points such as Kalindi Kunj Red Light and Road No. 13-A in Jasola Vihar. Traffic disruptions are also reported in Ghaziabad, with bottlenecks occurring at Meerut Tiraha, Ghukna Mod, and Mohan Nagar due to pilgrim diversions.\n\nIn Gurugram, traffic disruptions have been reported due to waterlogging at Bilaspur Chowk. The Gurugram Traffic Police have advised commuters to anticipate delays and plan their travel times accordingly. Additionally, NH-48 was affected last night by heavy waterlogging at GGR/Parade Road in the carriageway from Dhaula Kuan towards Gurugram. Travelers are encouraged to adjust their routes as necessary to avoid delays.\n\nIn response to the severe weather, Delhi Education Minister Atishi has announced that all schools, both government and private, will remain closed on Thursday, August 1. This decision was made in light of the heavy rainfall and the forecast for continued adverse weather conditions. The closure aims to ensure the safety of students and staff amid the ongoing disruption.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors":

The Pragati Maidan tunnel witnessed chaos due to waterlogging, while major intersections like ITO, Dhaula Kuan, and roads leading to the airport were plagued by traffic snarls.\n\nRainwater even infiltrated the Press Club of India, where people were seen sitting in knee-deep water, as seen in a purported photo shared online.\n\nThe heavy downpour also caused the wall of a private school in Daryaganj to collapse, damaging nearby parked vehicles. In another incident, a house in the Sabzi Mandi area crumbled under the relentless rain.\n\n\"MCD had sent notices to these buildings and were asked to either evacuate or get them fixed.

The incident occurred near the Khoda Colony area, where the roadside drain was under construction.\n\nDelhi minister Atishi announced on social media that all schools, both government and private, would remain closed on August 1 due to the forecast of continued heavy rainfall.

Airlines also warned of the possibility of more flight disruptions.\n\nDelhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena said he has asked officers to remain on alert.\n\n\"Apart from ensuring minimum

(Image: Reuters)\n\nDelhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) are reeling from the aftermath of intense thunderstorms that struck on Wednesday evening, unleashing a deluge of over 50 mm of rain per hour. The Salwan station in East Delhi's Mayur Vihar recorded an unprecedented 147.5 mm of rainfall from 8:30 am Wednesday to 7:15 am Thursday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\n\nThe heavy rainfall has caused significant disruptions across the city. Key locations such as ITO, Rajghat, and Anuvrat Marg remain heavily impacted by waterlogging. The Public Works Department (PWD) has been forced to close several underpasses including Minto Bridge, Pul Prahladpur, Jakhira, and Kirari, further compounding traffic issues. In addition, a house collapse in Subzi Mandi resulted in injuries to two people, and vehicles sustained damage due to a wall collapse in Daryaganj.\n\nThe IMD forecasts that Delhi will experience scattered drizzle to light rain throughout Thursday morning, with a yellow alert issued for the day to caution residents about potential worsening conditions. Officials reported that most waterlogging along major PWD roads was cleared overnight, except at ITO, where over five pumps were deployed to manage the situation.\n\nTraffic disruptions continue as the Delhi Police work to clear waterlogged underpasses in Zakhira, Okhla, Ashram, and Kishanganj (Azad Market). Uprooted trees continue to impede traffic flow in areas such as Sector-1 Dwarka, Rajapuri crossing, and Golf Course Road, Sector 16 Dwarka. A road cave-in at Dhaula Kuan has also led to the closure of affected routes.\n\nWaterlogging was notably severe in Lodhi Colony, Patiala House Court, Nyay Marg, Hanuman Road, Safdar Hashmi Marg, Chanakyapuri, Laxmi Nagar, and Kaka Nagar. Visuals circulating on social media highlighted the extent of the flooding, including a submerged road outside the new Parliament and waterlogged corridors of Connaught Place. Amit Gupta from the New Delhi Traders Association reported significant damage to shops in Connaught Place due to flooding, describing the situation as potentially hazardous due to compromised electrical facilities in service tunnels.\n\nSince Wednesday evening, the Public Works Department control room has received over 110 calls related to waterlogging. While rainfall intensity decreased after 8:30 p.m., it persisted in most parts of Delhi until 2:30 a.m. Thursday before clouds began to clear.\n\nWeather stations across Delhi reported substantial rainfall totals, with Safdarjung recording 107.6 mm, Palam 68.3 mm, Delhi University 104.5 mm, Najafgarh 112.5 mm, and Mayur Vihar 147.5 mm. Despite a lull in rainfall between 2:30 am and 5:30 am, the city remains on high alert as officials and residents cope with the extensive impact of the storm.\n\nAs Delhi prepares for continued unsettled weather, residents are advised to stay updated on conditions and avoid heavily affected areas to ensure their safety amidst the ongoing disruptions.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com",

A road cave-in at Dhaula Kuan has also led to the closure of affected routes.\n\nWaterlogging was notably severe in Lodhi Colony, Patiala House Court, Nyay Marg, Hanuman Road, Safdar Hashmi Marg, Chanakyapuri, Laxmi Nagar, and Kaka Nagar. Visuals circulating on social media highlighted the extent of the flooding, including a submerged road outside the new Parliament and waterlogged corridors of Connaught Place. Amit Gupta from the New Delhi Traders Association reported significant damage to shops in Connaught Place due to flooding, describing the situation as potentially hazardous due to compromised electrical facilities in service tunnels.\n\nSince Wednesday evening, the Public Works Department control room has received over 110 calls related to waterlogging. While rainfall intensity decreased after 8:30 p.m., it persisted in most parts of Delhi until 2:30 a.m. Thursday before clouds began to clear.\n\nWeather stations across Delhi reported substantial rainfall totals, with Safdarjung recording 107.6 mm, Palam 68.3 mm, Delhi University 104.5 mm, Najafgarh 112.5 mm, and Mayur Vihar 147.5 mm. Despite a lull in rainfall between 2:30 am and 5:30 am, the city remains on high alert as officials and residents cope with the extensive impact of the storm.\n\nAs Delhi prepares for continued unsettled weather, residents are advised to stay updated on conditions and avoid heavily affected areas to ensure their safety amidst the ongoing disruptions.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com",

Check route diversions", "body": "Delhi experienced an intense rainfall event on Wednesday evening, with over 100 millimeters of rain recorded in just one hour. This deluge led to significant waterlogging across various parts of the city, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue a 'red' warning. The IMD's Automatic Weather Station at Pragati Maidan reported 112.5 mm of rainfall in the span of just 60 minutes, qualifying it as a \"cloud burst.\" The recent heavy rainfall has led to extensive waterlogging and traffic disruptions across Delhi and its neighboring regions. The IMD's red warning and the ongoing Kanwar Yatra are contributing to the city's traffic woes. Commuters are advised to stay updated on weather and traffic conditions, plan their journeys ahead of time, and follow advisories to mitigate the impact of these disruptions.\n\nThe heavy rainfall has caused significant traffic issues across Delhi. Here are some key updates:\n\nThe ongoing Kanwar Yatra is further exacerbating traffic conditions in and around Delhi. Traffic restrictions are in effect on the carriageway from Kalindi Kunj to Noida, with one side reserved for Kanwariyas (pilgrims). This has led to heavy congestion at the Kalindi Kunj Red Light and Road No. 13-A in Jasola Vihar. Similar disruptions are observed in Ghaziabad at Meerut Tiraha, Ghukna Mod, and Mohan Nagar, where diversions for pilgrims have caused traffic bottlenecks.\n\nGurugram Traffic Police have reported waterlogging at Bilaspur Chowk, which may lead to further traffic disruptions. Commuters are advised to plan their travel time accordingly. Additionally, NH-48 is affected by heavy waterlogging at GGR/Parade Road in the carriageway from Dhaula Kuan towards Gurugram was reported last night. Travelers are encouraged to adjust their routes as needed to avoid delays.\n\nThe IMD has forecasted that Delhi and its surrounding National Capital Region (NCR) will continue to face moderate to heavy rainfall over next two days. In light of the ongoing weather conditions, the IMD has warned of slippery roads, reduced visibility, and potential traffic disruptions. Many airlines have issued an advisory regarding potential delays for flights to and from Delhi. Passengers are urged to arrive early at the airport due to anticipated slow traffic and waterlogging.

A house collapse in Subzi Mandi left two people injured while vehicles were damaged following a wall collapse in Daryaganj.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) said parts of Delhi were expected to get scattered drizzle to light rain on Thursday morning. A yellow alert, which relates to the bad weather that can potentially get worse, has been sounded for the rest of Thursday with light to moderate rainfall likely in parts of Delhi.\n\nOfficials said Moolchand and Tilak Bridge underpasses were waterlogged but they remained open for traffic. \"Most of the waterlogging along the main PWD roads was cleared overnight except ITO. Over five pumps were deployed at ITO to clear the water,\" said an official.\n\nDelhi Police said underpasses in Zakhira, Okhla, Ashram, and Kishanganj (Azad market) were dewatered but uprooted trees continued to impact traffic flow at Sector-1 Dwarka, Rajapuri crossing and Golf Course Road, Sector 16 Dwarka. A road cave-in at Dhaula Kuan led closure of the affected areas for traffic.\n\n\"We noticed much leakage from the DJB pipeline near the Minto Bridge underpass and closed it for traffic movement as a precautionary measure to avoid any untoward incident. At the surface level, waterlogging was reported from ITO, Dhaula Kuan, Sadar Bazaar, and some other areas along the Ring Road,\" said a PWD official.\n\nWaterlogging was also reported from Lodhi Colony, Patiala House Court, Nyay Marg, Hanuman Road, Safdar Hashmi Marg, Chanakyapuri, Laxmi Nagar and Kaka Nagar. Visuals of a waterlogged road outside the new Parliament went viral on social media along with waterlogged corridors of Connaught Place.\n\nAmit Gupta, a member of the New Delhi Traders Association, said several corridors and parking areas of Connaught Place were flooded and entered some shops. \"Water was flowing back from Panchkuian Road. There was waterlogging in A Block Middle Circle, H Block, and G Block...many shops suffered damage. The Middle Circle has a service tunnel with all electrical facilities. It seems like we are sitting on a ticking bomb,\" he said.\n\nAn official at the Public Works Department control room said they received over 110 calls regarding waterlogging on their helpline since Wednesday evening.\n\nA convergence of thunderclouds on Wednesday evening led to rain in Delhi and the National Capital Region with initial extremely intense rainfall of over 50mm per hour. Weather officials said there was a drop in the rain intensity after 8:30 pm on Wednesday but it continued in most parts of Delhi until 2:30 am before clouds began to clear up.\n\nPrivate forecaster Skymet Weather vice-president (meteorology and climate Change) Mahesh Palawat said 107.6 mm of rain in Delhi's Safdarjung was the highest 24-hour rainfall after 2010. In a post on X, he said the record was 184 mm on July 2, 1961.\n\nOn Thursday morning, police said water was drained out of stretches such as Chaudhary Fateh Singh Marg near Majnu Ka Tilla and Okhla underpass, which impacted traffic late on Wednesday evening. On Wednesday evening, warnings were issued to avoid stretches such as Anuvrat Marg, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Marg, Mahatma Gandhi Marg, and the carriageway from Moolchand towards Chirag Dilli, Outer Ring Road.\n\nIMD said weather stations, including Safdarjung, which is representative of Delhi's weather, received heavy rainfall (over 64.4mm in 24 hours) from 8:30 am on Wednesday until 5:30 am on Thursday. Safdarjung recorded 107.6mm of rainfall until 5:30 am, Palam 68.3mm, Delhi University 104.5mm, Najafgarh 112.5mm, and Mayur Vihar 147.5mm. Moderate rainfall was recorded at Narela (39.5mm) and Pitampura (45.5mm) during this period.

Old Rajinder Nagar, where the flooding of a coaching centre's basement resulted in the deaths of three UPSC aspirants days ago, was waterlogged. Area MLA Durgesh Pathak was seen standing in waist-deep water, attempting to clear the inundated stretch. Despite the rain, students protesting against the deaths continued their demonstration.\n\nThe area in front of Karol Bagh Metro Station was also submerged in knee-deep water; so was the popular Connaught Place where water entered the parking area and a few shops. \"The NDMC area, which pays the highest taxes in the city, is struggling because of lack of desilting by authorities. No lesson has been learnt from past years... Water is entering our shops... We are sitting on a ticking time bomb,\" said Amit Gupta, president of the Connaught Place Traders' Association.\n\nWaterlogging choked traffic in key areas such as ITO, Minto Bridge, Pul Prahladpur Railway Underpass, MB Road, Dhaula Kuan, Mathura Road, Sarita Vihar Metro Station, the carriageway from Moolchand towards Chirag Dilli, areas of Jangpura, Gaffar Market, Sadar Bazar, Anuvrat Marg.\n\nThe PWD received 30 complaints related to waterlogging, mostly from East Delhi -- Yamuna Vihar, Laxmi Nagar, Preet Vihar among others. The MCD, meanwhile, received four complaints. \"We have not received many complaints yet, but we are anticipating that more will be filed by early morning,\" an MCD official said. Work is on to remove water from roads, said officials.\n\nL-G V K Saxena urged officials to stay vigilant during the heavy rainfall. \"Apart from ensuring minimum inconvenience to people in general, they are advised to specifically address issues at sites prone to waterlogging, including coaching centres,\" he posted on X.\n\nAtishi said, \"There has been very heavy rainfall in Delhi in the last two hours. The Delhi government and MCD are closely monitoring low-lying areas and vulnerable waterlogging locations to prevent any untoward incidents.\"\n\nDelhi Mayor Shelly Oberoi said, \"Have instructed MCD commissioner and all officials to address any waterlogging occurrences as soon as possible. We all are available round the clock.\"\n\nParts of Gurgaon and Noida were also hit by the rain. In Narsinghpur on the Delhi-Jaipur highway, water had entered the main carriageway hindering traffic.

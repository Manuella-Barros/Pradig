Not only did Wie\u2019s two-stroke win over world No. 1 Stacy Lewis erase a decade of ups and downs that had defined one of the biggest stars in women\u2019s golf who burst onto the scene as a highly touted teenager, but, more importantly, it represented a major step forward for the game. The 2014 tournament marked the first time that the U.S. Women\u2019s Open and the U.S. Open were played on the same course (Pinehurst No. 2) in the same year. The event also featured the largest purse in women\u2019s golf at $4 million, with Wie earning $720,000. A decade later, the 2024 U.S. Women\u2019s Open from May 30 to June 2 at Lancaster (Pa.)

I just feel like as much as the Tour has grown, it\u2019s really still a battle to get bigger and get closer to pay equality. \u201cWe still have a lot of work cut out for us.\u201d As the LPGA finds more stability with tournament and broadcast partners, there\u2019s more money in women\u2019s golf than ever before. While it still pales in comparison to the eye-dropping numbers dominating the headlines and conversation on the PGA Tour and LIV on the men\u2019s side, you\u2019d be hard pressed to bat an eye at the growth in the women\u2019s game.

We\u2019re getting more money and playing better courses. And hopefully down the road, we get more people to watch the sport and really appreciate golf\u2014especially women\u2019s golf and truly appreciate the talent on our Tour.\u201d Led by brands like Ally, Epson, Deloitte, Chevron, Mizuho and KPMG, the increasing support of the LPGA and women\u2019s golf is a microcosm of the growing interest and investment across women\u2019s sports. Women\u2019s soccer and basketball are two major sports benefiting from brands and broadcasters\u2019 burgeoning investment.

It\u2019s about how can we make the space better off than before we were there? \u201cIt\u2019s all about intentionality, so we invest intentionally to move the market forward and move the landscape forward.\u201d Not only are advertisers and sponsors bullish on women\u2019s golf\u2014and women\u2019s sports in general\u2014but broadcasters are realizing the demand is there as well.

It shows them that you can follow your passion, make a living out of it and not have to choose between the two,\u201d Wie West said. \u201cI think that it shows that people care about us. I think a big difference is using charity terms when it comes to women: \u2018Oh, we have to support the women. We\u2019re doing this because it\u2019s going to make us feel good.\u2019 No, companies are raising the purses and being involved because it\u2019s good for them, it\u2019s good for their business and we\u2019re a great entertainment product. \u201cIt shows to the girls out there they are worth something, they\u2019re worth watching and they have that value.\u201d Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

(Reuters)\n\nThe US and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, three US officials said.\n\nAccording to the officials, American and British fighter jets and US ships hit a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide early details of an ongoing military operation.\n\nAlso struck by the US were eight uncrewed aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were determined to be presenting a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nThe Houthis' Al Masirah satellite news said at least two people were killed and 10 others were wounded in one of the strikes, which hit a radio building in the Red City port city of Hodeida. It aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others receiving treatment at a hospital. Other strikes hit outside of the Houthi-held capital, Sanaa, and elsewhere in the country, with little other information being released -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe strikes came a day after a US MQ-9 Reaper drone went down in Yemen, and the Houthis released footage they said showed the aircraft being targeted with a surface-to-air missile in a desert region of Yemen's central Marib province. It was the third such downing this month alone.\n\nAlso earlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThis is the fifth time that the US and British militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since Jan. 12. But the US also has been carrying out almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons that were prepared to launch.\n\nThe US F/A-18 fighter jets launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other US warships in the region also participated.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide early details of an ongoing military operation.\n\nAlso struck by the U.S. were eight uncrewed aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were determined to be presenting a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nThe Houthis' Al Masirah satellite news said at least two people were killed and 10 others were wounded in one of the strikes, which hit a radio building in the Red City port city of Hodeida. It aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others receiving treatment at a hospital. Other strikes hit outside of the rebel-held capital, Sanaa, and elsewhere in the country, with little other information being released -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe strikes came a day after a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone went down in Yemen, and the Houthis released footage they said showed the aircraft being targeted with a surface-to-air missile in a desert region of Yemen's central Marib province. It was the third such downing this month alone.\n\nAlso earlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. The Houthis have claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThis is the fifth time that the U.S. and British militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since Jan. 12. But the U.S. also has been carrying out almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons that were prepared to launch.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nShipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.\n\nU.S. warships, meanwhile, took out a number of missile launchers and drones targeting vessels in the region over the past week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. won't tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping.

The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Joint British-U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday, the highest publicly acknowledged death toll by the rebels from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over their attacks on shipping.\n\nThree U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe a then-ongoing attack, described the strikes Thursday as hitting a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities. They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nBut the Houthis focused Friday morning on just one of the strikes, which they said struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\n\"We confirm this brutal aggression against Yemen as punishment for its position in support of Gaza, in support of Israel to continue its crimes of genocide against the wounded, besieged and steadfast Gaza Strip,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the country's Defense Ministry said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on both Hodeida and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe Houthis ihave stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group [...]\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Joint British-U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday, the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThree U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe a then-ongoing attack, described the strikes Thursday as hitting a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities. They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nBut the Houthis focused Friday morning on just one of the strikes, which they said struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\n\"We confirm this brutal aggression against Yemen as punishment for its position in support of Gaza, in support of Israel to continue its crimes of genocide against the wounded, besieged and steadfast Gaza Strip,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the country's Defense Ministry said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on both Hodeida and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January, with the U.S. regularly carrying out its own in the time since as well. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.

The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group. Etat Major des Armees via Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, three U.S. officials said.\n\nAccording to the officials, American and British fighter jets and U.S. ships hit a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide early details of an ongoing military operation.\n\nAlso struck by the U.S. were eight uncrewed aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that the military had determined to be presenting a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nThe strikes come a day after a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone went down in Yemen. The Houthis released footage they said showed the aircraft being targeted with a surface-to-air missile in a desert region of Yemen's central Marib province. It marked the third such downing this month alone.\n\nAlso earlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. While no group claimed responsibility, suspicion fell on the Houthis.\n\nThis is the fifth time that the U.S. and U.K. militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since Jan. 12. But the U.S. also has been carrying out almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons that were prepared to launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, including the seizure of one vessel and the sinking of another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nShipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.\n\nU.S. warships, meanwhile, took out a number of missile launchers and drones targeting vessels in the region over the past week.\n\nPresident Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. won't tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping. But the counterattacks haven't appeared to diminish the Houthis' campaign against shipping in the region.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nShares in Trump Media slump after former president convicted in hush money trial", "source": {"uri": "centralmaine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kennebec Journal and Morning Sentinel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-National_Force_\u2013_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private military company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Maritime_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Maritime Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A-18 Hornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Joint British-U.S. airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday, the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThree U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity to describe a then-ongoing attack, described the strikes Thursday as hitting a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities. They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes took off from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nBut the Houthis focused Friday morning on a strike they said struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often aren't in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport, and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\n\"We confirm this brutal aggression against Yemen as punishment for its position in support of Gaza, in support of Israel to continue its crimes of genocide against the wounded, besieged and steadfast Gaza Strip,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam posted on X.\n\nMohammed al-Bukhaiti, a Houthi official, threatened both the U.S. and U.K. with further retaliation.\n\n\"We will meet escalation with escalation,\" he wrote on X.\n\nYemen's military spokesman, Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, gave the casualty figures, then alleged without offering any evidence that the rebels targeted the Eisenhower in response with drones and ballistic missiles. Another U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said that the aircraft carrier was fine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the country's Defense Ministry said that Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on both Hodeida and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January, with the U.S. regularly carrying out its own in the time since as well. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He didn't offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA. As many as three may have been lost in May alone.\n\nLolita C.

The strikes targeted a radio building in Hodeidah's Al-Hawk district and port of Salif.\n\nThe US and British militaries said they launched strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen on Thursday as part of efforts to deter the militant group from further disrupting shipping in the Red Sea, which has going on since a month after the Israel-Hamas war broke out. The Houthi rebels say their act of disrupting global commerce was aimed at showing solidarity with the Palestinians.\n\nThe US Central Command said in a statement that the American and British forces had hit 13 targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. The British defence ministry said the joint operation targeted three locations in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, which it said housed drones and surface-to-air weapons. The strikes reportedly struck a range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities.\n\nHouthi spokesperson Mohamed Abdelsalam said the strikes constituted a \"brutal aggression\" against Yemen as \"punishment\" for its position in support of Gaza. Additionally, Houthi-allied Iran condemned the strikes as \"violations of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity..., international laws and human rights\".\n\nThe US FA-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes launched from the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other US warships in the region also participated. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, although it remains to be confirmed. \"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostages. The group has launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nThe Houthis have launched a missile attack on the US aircraft carrier Eisenhower in the Red Sea in response to US and British strikes on Yemen, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said on Friday.\n\nOn Wednesday, another US MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, and the Houthis claimed they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The US Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA. As many as three may have been lost in May alone.\n\nPrior to that, the Houthis on Tuesday launched attacks on six ships in three different seas, the Iran-backed group said on Wednesday, including the Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier Laax which was damaged after reporting a missile strike off the Yemeni coast. Tuesday's Houthi attacks came as Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah for the first time - despite an order from the International Court of Justice to end its attacks on the city, where many Palestinians had taken refuge from bombardment elsewhere.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)", "source": {"uri": "indiatvnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India TV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_integrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Territorial integrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes launched from the USS Dwight D.

Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm.

It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January, with the U.S. regularly carrying out its own in the time since as well. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis\u00b4 secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn\u00b4t report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA. As many as three may have been lost in May alone.\n\nBaldor reported from Washington.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak issues a statement after British and US forces struck Houthi targets in Yemen, at 10 Downing Street, London, Friday May 31, 2024.

They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nBut the Houthis focused Friday morning on just one of the strikes, which they said struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\n\"We confirm this brutal aggression against Yemen as punishment for its position in support of Gaza, in support of Israel to continue its crimes of genocide against the wounded, besieged and steadfast Gaza Strip,\" Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the country's Defense Ministry said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on both Hodeida and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January, with the U.S. regularly carrying out its own in the time since as well. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide early details of an ongoing military operation.\n\nAlso Read | India on Israeli Attack in Rafah: MEA Expresses Deep Concern Over Israeli Air Strike on Refugee Camps for Displaced People in Gaza's Rafah (Watch Video).\n\nAlso struck by the US were eight uncrewed aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were determined to be presenting a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nThe strikes come a day after a US MQ-9 Reaper drone went down in Yemen, and the Houthis released footage they said showed the aircraft being targeted with a surface-to-air missile in a desert region of Yemen's central Marib province. It marked the third such downing this month alone.\n\nAlso Read | Andrew Tate Loses Appeal to Relax Judicial Restrictions as He Awaits Human Trafficking, Rape Trial.\n\nAlso earlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. While no group claimed responsibility, suspicion fell on the Houthis.\n\nThis is the fifth time that the US and British militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since January 12. But the US also has been carrying out almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons that were prepared to launch.\n\nThe US F/A-18 fighter jets launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other US warships in the region also participated.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nShipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.\n\nUS warships, meanwhile, took out a number of missile launchers and drones targeting vessels in the region over the past week.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the US won't tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping. But the counterattacks haven't appeared to diminish the Houthis' campaign against shipping in the region.

The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group. Etat Major des Armees via AP\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. and Britain struck 13 Houthi targets in several locations in Yemen on Thursday in response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, three U.S. officials said.\n\nAccording to the officials, American and British fighter jets and U.S. ships hit a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide early details of an ongoing military operation.\n\nAlso struck by the U.S. were eight uncrewed aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that the military had determined to be presenting a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nThe strikes come a day after a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone went down in Yemen. The Houthis released footage they said showed the aircraft being targeted with a surface-to-air missile in a desert region of Yemen's central Marib province. It marked the third such downing this month alone.\n\nAlso earlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. While no group claimed responsibility, suspicion fell on the Houthis.\n\nThis is the fifth time that the U.S. and U.K. militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since Jan. 12. But the U.S. also has been carrying out almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons that were prepared to launch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, including the seizure one vessel and the sinking of another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nShipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.\n\nU.S. warships, meanwhile, took out a number of missile launchers and drones targeting vessels in the region over the past week.\n\nPresident Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the U.S. won't tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping. But the counterattacks haven't appeared to diminish the Houthis' campaign against shipping in the region.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed strikes took place against the Iranian-backed terror group on Thursday as part of a response to assaults on cargo ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nBritish and American fighter jets as well as US ships hit a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel and other facilities, according to officials. Also struck were eight uncrewed aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen that were determined to be presenting a threat to US and coalition forces.\n\nThe MoD said intelligence had confirmed two locations near Hudaydah as being involved with the anti-shipping attacks, with buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long range drones.\n\nSurface-to-air weapons used to impede coalition operations to safeguard shipping in the region were also believed to be on-site. A set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, were also identified as being involved in the command and control of the group's anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRAF Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on the target buildings at the three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs. The MoD said the 'utmost care' was taken in planning the strikes to 'minimise any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure'.\n\nThe US F/A-18 fighter jets launched from the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other US warships in the region also participated. This is the fifth time the US and British militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since January 12.\n\nThe US has also been carrying out almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons that were prepared to launch. The Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden , demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. The Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration. Shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because of the threat.\n\nEarlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. While no group claimed responsibility, suspicion fell on the Houthis.\n\nMeanwhile US warships took out a number of missile launchers and drones targeting vessels in the region over the past week. President Joe Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the US will not tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping. But the counterattacks have not appeared to diminish the Houthis' campaign against shipping in the region.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, with other U.S. warships in the region also participating, officials said.\n\nHowever, the Houthis focused Friday morning on just one of the strikes, which they said hit a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea.\n\nTheir Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of a bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in a hospital.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians.\n\nThe rebel force has held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014.\n\nOther strikes hit outside Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said.\n\nLittle other information was released on those sites, likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\n\"We confirm this brutal aggression against Yemen as punishment for its position in support of Gaza, in support of Israel to continue its crimes of genocide against the wounded, besieged and steadfast Gaza Strip,\" Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdulsalam wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nIn the U.K., the Defense Ministry said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on both Hodeida and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January, with the U.S. regularly carrying out its own in the time since as well.\n\nAbdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point, as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded.\n\nHe did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end its attacks on Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children.\n\nThe latest conflict began following Hamas' Oct. 7 incursion on south Israel that killed about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel, and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nThis week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it.\n\nThe U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons\".\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" the British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe US and the UK have been carrying out strikes against the Houthis since January, with the US regularly attacking on its own as well. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not give a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nOn Wednesday, another US MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they had fired a surface-to-air missile at it.

Gen. Yahya Saree, gave the casualty figures, then alleged without offering any evidence that the rebels targeted the Eisenhower in response with drones and ballistic missiles. Another U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, said that the aircraft carrier was fine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the country's Defense Ministry said that Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on both Hodeida and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described its targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said. \"There's an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January, with the U.S. regularly carrying out its own in the time since as well.

They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe US F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes launched from the USS Dwight D Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other US warships in the region also participated.\n\nBut the Houthis focused on Friday morning on just one of the strikes, which they said hit a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid.\n\nThe Houthis claimed all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians.

It marked the third such downing this month alone.\n\nAlso earlier this week, missile attacks twice damaged a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-owned ship in the Red Sea off the coast of Yemen, with a private security firm saying radio traffic suggested the vessel took on water after being struck. While no group claimed responsibility, suspicion fell on the Houthis.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nRead more on FRANCE 24 English\n\nRead also:\n\nStrike on Iraq gas complex kills at least four Yemeni workers\n\nSeabed warfare: Did Houthi rebels attack undersea cables in Red Sea?\n\nUS and UK launch new round of strikes against Houthi sites in Yemen", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_and_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command and control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fighter aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-National_Force_\u2013_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-National Force \u2013 Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-to-air_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surface-to-air missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marib_Governorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marib Governorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Maritime_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Maritime Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_military_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private military company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_24", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France 24"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/france_24_english_articles_100/f6dae69fe818bf8f48414b4fedb8a989", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604794", "eventUri": "eng-9604794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels say.\n\nIt is the highest publicly acknowledged death toll by the Houthis from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over their attacks on shipping.\n\nThree US officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the strikes Thursday as hitting a wide range of underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a

just one of the strikes, which they said struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea.\n\nTheir Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one

to protect British interests abroad after the RAF carried out strikes against Houthi rebels.\n\nBritish and US forces struck Houthi targets in Yemen in the fifth combined operation since January.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed it had carried out strikes against the Iran-backed group on Thursday, as a response to attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nIn a statement on Friday morning, the Prime Minister said: \"Last night the RAF successfully conducted a fifth set of strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen alongside the US.\n\n\"These strikes were conducted to further degrade the military capabilities of the Houthis and to prevent further attacks on international shipping.\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\n\"There is an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose, 197 attacks since November, all our intelligence indicates that previous sets of strikes have been successful in degrading military capabilities of the Houthis: targeting supply, command and control launch sites for missiles and there is also a risk in inaction that would damage the global economy and further risk our international security.\"\n\nThe MoD said intelligence had confirmed two locations near Hudaydah, around 142 miles from the capital Sana'a, as being involved with the attacks, with buildings thought to house drone ground control facilities and storage for very long range drones.\n\nSurface-to-air weapons used to impede coalition operations to safeguard shipping in the region were also believed to be on site.\n\nA set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, were also identified as being involved in the command and control of the group's anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRAF Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on the target buildings at the three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs.\n\nTwo people were killed and 10 others injured in one of the strikes, according to the Houthis' Al Masirah satellite news.\n\nThis is the fifth time the US and British militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since January 12.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage.\n\nHouthi rebels have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nThe attacks have disrupted shipping routes in the region.", "source": {"uri":

The targets included underground facilities, missile launchers, command and control sites, a Houthi vessel, and eight uncrewed aerial vehicles that posed a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nThis marks the fifth combined operation against the Houthis by the US and British militaries since January 12.The US has also been conducting almost daily strikes to take out Houthi targets, including incoming missiles and drones aimed at ships, as well as weapons prepared for launch.\n\nThe US F/A-18 fighter jets were launched from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, with other US warships in the region also participating.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding an end to the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel, and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration. As a result, shipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined due to the threat.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and other senior leaders have repeatedly warned that the US will not tolerate the Houthi attacks against commercial shipping. However, the counterattacks have not appeared to diminish the Houthis' campaign against shipping in the region.\n\nUS warships have taken out a number of missile launchers and drones targeting vessels in the region over the past week.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

The GBU-72 bomb was dropped by a U.S. Air Force jet in an effort to destroy an underground Houthi facility. One official said the bomb hit the target, but it wasn't yet clear if it had been destroyed or if there were any civilian casualties.\n\nThe Houthis, who control much of Yemen, said 16 people were killed and 40 more wounded, including an unspecified number of civilians, but there was no independent confirmation of those numbers. If confirmed, it would be one of the deadliest strikes since the U.S. and the U.K. started their campaign in January against the Houthis, whose rocket attacks have severely disrupted the vital Red Sea trade route.\n\nThe Iran-backed Houthis have carried out scores of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, including U.S. warships, since November, citing solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. Central Command, CENTCOM, said 13 Houthi sites were targeted in the latest strikes.\n\n\"The American-British aggression will not prevent us from continuing our military operations,\" Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said on X, formerly Twitter, vowing to \"meet escalation with escalation.\"\n\nIn response, the rebels launched a missile attack on the U.S. aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Red Sea, according to Houthi spokesman Yahya Saree, who added that the group \"will not hesitate to respond directly and immediately to every new aggression on Yemeni territories.\"\n\nU.S. military officials did not immediately comment on the Houthi claim to have targeted the USS Eisenhower.\n\nYemen's Houthi-controlled Al-Masirah TV network broadcast a video showing bloodied men wounded in a purported strike on a building housing a radio station in the western port city of Hodeida. The channel showed victims receiving treatment at a hospital, although the authenticity of the images could not be independently verified.\n\nA hospital employee in Hodeida said many militants were among those killed and wounded in the attack but was unable to give exact figures.\n\nThe British defense ministry said its warplanes launched strikes in \"a joint operation with U.S. forces against Houthi military facilities.\"\n\nThe ministry said intelligence indicated two sites near Hodeida were involved in the attacks on shipping, \"with a number of buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons.\"\n\nAnother \"command and control\" site had been identified further south, it said in a statement.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said \"the strikes were taken in self-defense against an ongoing threat,\" adding the rebels had carried out 197 attacks since November.\n\nCENTCOM said the strikes were \"necessary to protect our forces, ensure freedom of navigation, and make international waters safer and more secure.\"\n\nIran condemned the U.S.-U.K. military action, saying it aims to \"spread insecurity in the region.\"\n\nThe \"governments of the United States and the United Kingdom are responsible for the consequences of these crimes against the Yemeni people,\" said its foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanani.\n\nSince January, the United States and Britain have launched repeated strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen in response to the rebels' harassment of shipping. In February, the Houthis held a mass funeral in Sanaa for 17 fighters they said were killed in U.S. and British strikes.\n\nThe U.S. and British strikes have not stamped out the campaign by the rebels, who have vowed to target American and British vessels as well as all ships heading to Israeli ports.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USS Dwight D.

combined operation since January.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed it had carried out strikes against the Iran-backed group on Thursday, as a response to attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nIn a statement on Friday morning, the Prime Minister said: \"Last night the RAF successfully conducted a fifth set of strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen alongside the US.\n\n\"These strikes were conducted to further degrade the military capabilities of the Houthis and to prevent further attacks on international shipping.\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nAsked whether this new round of strikes risked escalation with Iran, who back the Houthis, Mr Sunak said: \"We have always said that we will not hesitate to protect British interests abroad and at home.\n\n\"There is an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose, 197 attacks since November, all our intelligence indicates that previous sets of strikes have been successful in degrading military capabilities of the Houthis: targeting supply, command and control launch sites for missiles and there is also a risk in inaction that would damage the global economy and further risk our international security.\"\n\nThe MoD said intelligence had confirmed two locations near Hudaydah, around 142 miles from the capital Sana'a, as being involved with the attacks, with buildings thought to house drone ground control facilities and storage for very long range drones.\n\nSurface-to-air weapons used to impede coalition operations to safeguard shipping in the region were also believed to be on site.\n\nA set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, were also identified as being involved in the command and control of the group's anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRAF Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on the target buildings at the three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs.\n\nThe MoD said the \"utmost care\" was taken in planning the strikes to \"minimise any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure\".\n\nTwo people were killed and 10 others injured in one of the strikes, according to the Houthis' Al Masirah satellite news.\n\nThis is the fifth time the US and British militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since January 12.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in recent months, demanding that Israel ends the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe war began after

At least 42 people were reportedly injured.\n\n\"The American-British aggression will not prevent us from continuing our military operations in support of Palestine,\" Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said on X, warning that the rebels would \"meet escalation with escalation\".\n\nThe US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on X that attacks against 13 Houthi targets had \"successfully destroyed\" eight uncrewed aerial vehicles, or drones, in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and over the Red Sea.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted attacks on Hodeidah and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons\".\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the military action was a form of \"self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose\".\n\nThe Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group that controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a Western-backed and Saudi-led coalition, has emerged as a strong supporter of Palestinians in Israel's ongoing war on Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 people.\n\nThe group has launched repeated drone and missile attacks on ships in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb strait, and the Gulf of Aden since November, demanding that Israel end the war.\n\nIn Tehran, Houthi-allied Iran condemned the US-UK strikes as \"violations of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity..., international laws and human rights\", Iranian state media reported.\n\n\"The aggressor US and British governments are responsible for the consequences of these crimes against the Yemeni people,\" Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said.\n\nAccording to the US Maritime Administration, the Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping in total, killing three sailors, seizing one vessel and sinking another. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran.\n\nThe campaign has forced shipping firms to avoid the Red Sea route, which normally carries about 12 percent of global trade, rerouting cargo to longer and more expensive journeys around Southern Africa.\n\nSince January, the United States and the United Kingdom have launched retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, aiming to degrade their ability to attack the vital waterways. But the attacks have done little to deter the Houthis.\n\nOn Wednesday, they said they had attacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier and several other vessels in response to Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.", "source": {"uri": "vocfm.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "Voice of the Cape"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aneeqa_du_plessis@vocfm.co.za", "name": "Aneeqa Du Plessis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

interests in Red Sea: UK PM Rishi Sunak", "body": "London, May 31 (IANS/DPA) UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has vowed to protect British interests abroad after the Royal Air Force (RAF) carried out strikes against Houthi rebels.\n\nThe UK and US forces struck Houthi targets in Yemen in the fifth combined operation since January.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed strikes took place against the Houthis on Thursday as part of a response to Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nIn a statement on Friday morning, Sunak said, \"Last night, the RAF successfully conducted a fifth set of strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen alongside the US.\"\n\n\"These strikes were conducted to further degrade the military capabilities of the Houthis and to prevent further attacks on international shipping.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nAsked whether this new round of strikes risked escalation with Iran, Sunak said, \"We have always said that we will not hesitate to protect British interests abroad and at home.\"\n\n\"There is an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose, 197 attacks since November, all our intelligence indicates that previous sets of strikes have been successful in degrading the military capabilities of the Houthis: targeting supply, command and control launch sites for missiles and there is also a risk in inaction that would damage the global economy and further risk our international security.\"\n\nThe MoD said intelligence had confirmed two locations near Hudaydah as being involved with the anti-shipping attacks, with buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones.\n\nSurface-to-air weapons used to impede coalition operations to safeguard shipping in the region were also believed to be on-site.\n\nA set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, were also identified as being involved in the command and control of the group's anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRAF Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on the target buildings at the three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs.\n\nThe MoD said the \"utmost care\" was taken in planning the strikes to \"minimise any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure.\"\n\nTwo people were killed, and ten others injured in one of the strikes, according to the Houthis' Al Masirah satellite news.\n\nThis is the fifth time the US and UK militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since January 12.\n\nThe Houthis, in recent months, have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nThe attacks have disrupted shipping routes in the region.",

Eisenhower in the Red Sea following US strikes on targets inside Yemen, reports the Mirror.\n\nThe Houthi rebels said they carried out an attack on the massive US vessel in response to strikes on Thursday, May 30, on Houthi targets in Yemen by the Britain and US. Yahya Saree, the Houthis military spokesman, claimed that 16 people have been killed and 41 others, including civilians, have been injured in the strikes, carried out by the UK and US in order to try and curb attacks on commercial shipping.\n\nTwo locations near Hudaydah have been confirmed by intelligence as being involved in the anti-shipping attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) confirmed. Buildings in the area have also been identified as ground control facilities for drones and storage for long-range drones.\n\nAnother facility at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, have also been linked to the Houthi attacks on shipping in the region. The MoD said that strikes have been carried out on a wide range of targets in Yemen, using American and British fighter jets and US ships.\n\nTyphoon FGR4 fighters from the Royal Air Force hit buildings at the three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs, the ministry said. Prime minister Rishi Sunak said last night's strikes were conducted \"to further degrade the military capabilities of the Houthis and to prevent further attacks on international shipping\".\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose,\" he added. Houthi fighters have attacked ships passing through the area more than 50 times since November, after they began targeting ships in solidarity with Hamas, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nThe Houthis released images on Wednesday which they claim showed a US MQ-9 Reaper drone being downed by a surface-to-air missile in Yemen's central Marib province. The images appear to show the MQ-9 with the aircraft's tail section broken off.\n\nHowever, there was no clear blast damage to the downed drone and it seemed broadly intact. One of the images released bore Wednesday's date.\n\nA US defence official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters, told the Associated Press that \"the US Air Force has not lost any aircraft operating within US Central Command's area of responsibility.\" The CIA is also believed to have been operating reaper drones in the area - the agency declined to comment when approached by AP.\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond.

At least 42 people were reportedly injured.\n\n\"The American-British aggression will not prevent us from continuing our military operations in support of Palestine,\" Houthi official Mohammed al-Bukhaiti said on X, warning that the rebels would \"meet escalation with escalation\".\n\nThe US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on X that attacks against 13 Houthi targets had \"successfully destroyed\" eight uncrewed aerial vehicles, or drones, in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and over the Red Sea.\n\nThe British Ministry of Defence said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s conducted attacks on Hodeidah and further south in Ghulayfiqah. It described targets as \"buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones, as well as surface-to-air weapons\".\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the military action was a form of \"self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose\".\n\nThe Houthi movement, an Iran-aligned group that controls much of Yemen after nearly a decade of war against a Western-backed and Saudi-led coalition, has emerged as a strong supporter of Palestinians in Israel's ongoing war on Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 people.\n\nThe group has launched repeated drone and missile attacks on ships in the Red Sea, the Bab al-Mandeb strait, and the Gulf of Aden since November, demanding that Israel end the war.\n\nIn Tehran, Houthi-allied Iran condemned the US-UK strikes as \"violations of Yemen's sovereignty and territorial integrity..., international laws and human rights\", Iranian state media reported.\n\n\"The aggressor US and British governments are responsible for the consequences of these crimes against the Yemeni people,\" Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said.\n\nAccording to the US Maritime Administration, the Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping in total, killing three sailors, seizing one vessel and sinking another. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran.\n\nThe campaign has forced shipping firms to avoid the Red Sea route, which normally carries about 12 percent of global trade, rerouting cargo to longer and more expensive journeys around Southern Africa.\n\nSince January, the United States and the United Kingdom have launched retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, aiming to degrade their ability to attack the vital waterways. But the attacks have done little to deter the Houthis.\n\nOn Wednesday, they said they had attacked a Greek-owned bulk carrier and several other vessels in response to Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebellion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebellion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Improved tension between Houthi rebels, the US and UK due to alleged attacks and escalation of military strikes in Yemen. The Yemen war involves complicated historical context, religious division and Houthis' opposition to Israel.\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen reportedly launched missile attacks at the US aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Red Sea. As of the time of writing, the US DoD has not confirmed these claims by the Houthis. Carriers never travel alone (and especially in a conflict zone) and are heavily protected by the rest of the task force. The claimed strike comes as retaliation for renewed Anglo-American strikes on Houthi targets within Yemen. The British stated the strikes were carried out by Typhoon fighter jets, while the Americans likely used F/A-18 jets.\n\nHouthis reportedly attack US carrier\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen have claimed to have launched a missile attack on the US Nimtz-class carrier, USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69), in the Red Sea. Newsweek stated, \"Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree stated in a televised announcement that the missile attack was a direct response to the coalition's recent operations in Yemen.\" He claimed that several missiles and rockets reached their target and scored a \"precise hit.\" This claim should be taken with skepticism for now.\n\nPhoto: USN\n\nThe Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree also claimed that the Anglo-American strikes killed 16 people and wounded another 41, including civilians. These claims have not been independently verified. Saree went on to say that the strikes targeted a port, a radio building, the Ghalifa camp, and two houses. The British have said that \"utmost\" care was been taken to avoid civilian causalities.\n\nThe Eisenhower (Ike) has been involved in operations in the Red Sea - including against the Houthis - since January. USNI News previously reported in April that Ike has shot down Houthi missiles and drones.\n\nThe Eisenhower is one of the US Navy's older carriers having been commissioned in 1977. She is the second of the ten Nimitz-class carriers. During her career, she has participated in the Gulf War and American operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. So far, she has not been certified to operate F-35Cs (and so she carries F/A-18s). She is currently scheduled to be decommissioned in 2029, although this might be pushed back.\n\nPhoto: Lawrence Reid US Navy\n\nIke's website states the carrier is the flagship for Commander, Carrier Strike Group (CCSG) 2 and is the \"Navy's finest 5-star aircraft carrier.\" It also states the vessel provides a \"wide range of flexible mission capabilities, includingmaritime security operations, expeditionary power projection, forward naval presence, crisis response, sea control, deterrence, counter-terrorism, information operations, security cooperation and counter-proliferation.\n\nRelated 30 Years: The Eurofighter Typhoon's Growth Since Maiden Flight The fighter is expected to remain in service until the 2050s.\n\nMore Anglo-American strikes on the Houthis\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom have launched a new wave of attacks on Houthis in the northern provinces of Sanaa, Hodeidah, and Taiz. The US Central Command stated the two nations hit 13 targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nPhoto: perfect-picture-hunter | Shutterstock\n\nThe Americans and British have stated the strikes are to deter the rebel group from further attacking civilian shipping in the Red Sea.\n\n\"Overnight, Royal Air Force Typhoons conducted a fifth wave of strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen in order to further degrade their capabilities and help prevent further attacks on international shipping.\" - British Ministry of Defense\n\nThe British released a statement saying the UK participated in a joint operation with US forces against Houthi military facilities to \"degrade their ability to persist with their attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\" The British MoD further stated these attacks had killed innocent merchant mariners from Vietnam and the Philippines and sunk the bulk carrier Rubymar.\n\n\"Between approximately 3:15 and 5 p.m. (Sanaa time) on May 30, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) forces successfully destroyed eight uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) in Iranian-backed Houthi controlled areas of Yemen and over the Red Sea.\" - USCENTCOM\n\nPhoto: Jamie Hunter | Royal Air Force\n\nThe report said that intelligence had confirmed locations housing drone ground control facilities, storage for very long-range drones, and surface-to-air weapons.\n\nThe British strikes were conducted by Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s. The Typhoons used Paveway IV-guided bombs and were refueled by RAF Voyager tankers.\n\nRelated What Are The Combat Capabilities Of The Royal Saudi Air Force? Saudi Arabia has been fighting the Houthi menace since 2015. Simple Flying now examines the combat capabilities of the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF).\n\nThe Houthis & the failed Yemen state\n\nYemen is a complicated Arab nation in the southern corner of the Arabian Peninsula. It overlooks the vital Red Sea lanes, meaning many of the world's freighters pass close to Yemen. With a population of around 35 million, it is the most populous country on the peninsula. The country is religiously divided between the Shia Muslim Houthis and the Sunni majority south. Between 1962 and 1990, much of what is now controlled by the Houthi rebels was an independent country called North Yemen.\n\nPhoto: Peterfz30/Shutterstock\n\nIn 1990, North Yemen united with South Yemen to form the modern Republic of Yemen. However, following ongoing political instability since the Arab Spring of 2011, Yemen collapsed into civil war in 2015. Since then, the country has been de facto split between North and South Yemen again.\n\nThe Houthis (allied with Iran) are deeply opposed to the State of Israel and the ongoing war in Gaza. They say their attacks on international shipping are targeting Israel-affiliated ships and are in solidarity with Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aaron_spray@simpleflying.com", "name": "Aaron Spray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

These actions are necessary to protect our forces, ensure freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US, coalition and merchant vessels.\"\n\nThe Pentagon has not publicly released any information on the nature or location of the targets. But the UK Defense Ministry said Royal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s partaking in the overnight strikes hit buildings at two locations in Hodeidah and other facilities further south along the coast at Ghulayfiqah.\n\nThe UK Defense Ministry said its intelligence indicated the target buildings at all three locations were linked to the Houthis' drone attacks on commercial shipping off Yemen's coast.\n\n\"Intelligence had confirmed two locations near [Hodeidah] as being involved with the Houthi anti-shipping attacks, with a number of buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long range drones, as well as surface to air weapons used to impede coalition operations to safeguard shipping in the region,\" the statement read.\n\nWhy it matters: The Houthis said 16 people were killed and 42 wounded, marking the highest recorded death toll of the campaign the United States and United Kingdom kicked off in January in a bid to clamp down on the Houthi attacks.\n\nHouthi media claimed that civilian homes were bombed overnight on the Red Sea coast and said a building housing a radio station in Hodeidah was struck. Explosions were also reported in Sanaa.\n\nThe US and UK have not confirmed any civilian casualties. \"As ever, the utmost care was taken in planning the strikes to minimise any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure. Conducting the strikes in the hours of darkness should also have mitigated yet further any such risks,\" the UK Defense Ministry statement read.\n\nWhat's next: The airstrike campaign is heating up once again, but Western officials say they have little expectation the Houthis will back down anytime soon.\n\nThe Yemeni rebels have vowed to continue their attacks on what they describe as international shipping linked to Israel until Israel ends its war in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"The American-British aggression will not prevent us from continuing our military operations in support of Palestine, and we will meet escalation with escalation,\" Muhamad al-Bukhaiti, a member of the Houthis' political bureau, wrote on X.\n\nUS F/A-18s launched from the USS Eisenhower have led a campaign of mid-air interceptions over the southern Red Sea to protect international shipping and coalition ships patrolling commercial waterways.\n\nHouthi spokesperson Yehiya Saree on Friday said his side had retaliated with a drone and ballistic missile attack against the Eisenhower. US defense officials pushed back, however, saying no such attack materialized.\n\nSince the start of the campaign early this year, senior US commanders have acknowledged that their intelligence underestimated the size of the Houthis' Iranian-made missile and drone stockpiles, leaving an open question as to how long the campaign to degrade the militia's weaponry will take.\n\nThe Biden administration has not authorized the military to target Houthi leadership, but rather to neutralize its weapons capabilities.

confirmed strikes took place against the Houthis on Thursday as part of a response to Houthi attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden.\n\nThe MoD said intelligence had confirmed two locations near Hudaydah as being involved with the anti-shipping attacks, with buildings identified as housing drone ground control facilities and providing storage for very long-range drones.\n\nSurface-to-air weapons used to impede coalition operations to safeguard shipping in the region were also believed to be on-site.\n\nA set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, were also identified as being involved in the command and control of the group's anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRAF Typhoon FGR4s conducted strikes on the target buildings at the three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs.\n\nThe MoD said the \"utmost care\" was taken in planning the strikes to \"minimise any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure.\"\n\nTwo people were killed and ten others injured in one of the strikes, according to the Houthis' Al Masirah satellite news.\n\nThis is the fifth time the US and UK militaries have conducted a combined operation against the Houthis since January 12.\n\nThe Houthis, in recent months, have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians.\n\nThe war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nShipping through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has declined because

Eisenhower, a spokesman said in a televised speech on Friday. He gave no more details and there's no indication the ship was damaged or close to being hit. The Houthis have regularly attacked U.S. naval vessels this year with drones and missiles, all of them missing or being intercepted.\n\nThe U.S. and U.K. militaries struck 13 Houthi targets in Yemen and, according to the Houthis, killed at least 16 people. That would make it the deadliest assault on the group since the start of a military campaign in January to prevent its attacks on ships in the Red Sea.\n\nThe Houthis said some of those people were civilians who were in the port city of Hodeida. Sanaa, the capital, and other areas were also struck, the Houthis said.\n\nThe U.S. military said that, in addition to the strikes, it destroyed eight unmanned aerial vehicles in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and surrounding waters on Thursday.\n\n\"It was determined that these UAVs and sites presented a threat to U.S. and coalition forces and merchant vessels in the region,\" U.S. Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in the Middle East, said.\n\nHouthi missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden started in November and have disrupted global trade. Many major shipping firms are avoiding the area, which links to the Suez Canal, and sending ships going between Asia and Europe on much longer voyages around southern Africa.

A communications network in the neighboring Taiz province was also reported to be targeted.\n\nUS Central Command said that its forces \"alongside UK Armed Forces conducted strikes against 13 Houthi targets\" in Houthi-controlled Yemen, which is where most Yemenis live.

The US has also launched hundreds of unilateral strikes, which have done nothing to deter Houthi attacks on shipping that began in response to Israel's onslaught in Gaza.\n\nThe latest round of US-UK airstrikes came after the Houthis struck a ship in the Red Sea and said they downed a US MQ-9 Reaper drone for the sixth time since November 2023. The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, have made clear they will not stop their attacks until there is a ceasefire in Gaza and a lifting of the Israeli siege.\n\nThe US backed a brutal Saudi/UAE war against the Houthis from 2015-2022 that involved heavy airstrikes and a blockade, and the Houthis only became more of a capable fighting force during that time.\n\nThe war killed at least 377,000 people, with more than half dying of starvation and disease caused by the siege. A ceasefire between the Houthis and Saudis has held relatively well since April 2022, but new US sanctions are now blocking the implementation of a lasting peace deal.", "source": {"uri": "news.antiwar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News From Antiwar.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airstrike", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airstrike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiz_Governorate", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taiz Governorate"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taiz Governorate"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hudaydah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Hudaydah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Aden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Atomics_MQ-9_Reaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blockade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational_Forces", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Multinational Forces", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Special Operations", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://news.antiwar.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/awc_logo_for-circle-profile_600sq-01.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604794", "eventUri": "eng-9604794", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Wednesday said that they had attacked another commercial ship in the Mediterranean as part of the fourth phase of their missile and drone campaign against ships in support of the Palestinian

less than a week.\n\nHe also said the militia had attacked the Marshall Island-flagged bulk ship Laax and the Malta-flagged bulk carriers Morea and Sealady in the Red Sea.\n\nThose ships were targeted because they breached a ban on sailing to Israel.\n\nThe Houthi official said that they launched cruise missiles against two American ships, Alba and Maersk Hartford, in the Arabian Sea.\n\nLast week, the Houthis claimed their first strike on a ship in the Mediterranean, as they extended their missile and drone operations into new waters.\n\nSince November, the Houthis have seized one commercial ship, sunk another, and fired hundreds of ballistic missiles, drones and remotely controlled and explosives-laden boats at commercial and naval ships in international waters off Yemen, as well as in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Houthis say they want to put pressure on Israel to end its war on Gaza while also targeting US and UK ships for backing Israel and bombing Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis' announcement of new attacks came hours after the US Central Command reported that the Houthis fired five ballistic missiles from areas under their control at international ships in the Red Sea on Tuesday, three of which struck the bulk carrier Laax.\n\nAccording to the US military, the ship's crew is safe and sailing to its destination and that neither the US-led marine coalition nor any other international ship reported being hit by the other Houthi missiles.\n\nFive drones fired by the Houthis over the Red Sea on Tuesday morning failed to reach their target after being destroyed by CENTCOM forces.\n\nTwo UK maritime agencies reported on Tuesday that a commercial ship in the Red Sea was damaged after being struck by three missiles off Hodeida in Yemen.\n\nAt the same time, Houthi media said on Tuesday that US and UK aircraft carried out two raids on the Al-Jabanah area in the western province of Hodeida, but provided no specifics about the targets.\n\nThe US and the UK have conducted airstrikes on Houthi-controlled Yemen, saying they are targeting drone and missile launchers as well as storage sites.", "source": {"uri": "arabnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

insisting it was in \"self defence\".\n\nIn an announcement on Friday morning, the embattled resident of number 10 said the action was done alongside the US.\n\nThis comes after Iran-backed Houthi rebels have launched attacks on ships in the Red Sea in a bid to disrupt international shipping.\n\nThe group claims it is doing so in a bid to undermine the United States and Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nThe Red Sea, which leads to the essential Suez Canal linking the Mediterranean Sea to the Indian Ocean, is one of the world's busiest shipping routes.\n\nUK and US-backed forces have been patrolling the region targeting rebels to ensure ships can pass freely.\n\nThe prime minister said in a statement: \"Last night the RAF successfully conducted a fifth set of strikes against Houthi military targets in Yemen alongside the US.\n\n\"These strikes were conducted to further degrade the military capabilities of the Houthis and to prevent further attacks on international shipping.\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defence in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nAdditionally, speaking about the impact of the fresh strikes on already fraught relations with Iran, Sunak said: \"We have always said that we will not hesitate to protect British interests abroad and at home.\n\n\"There is an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose, 197 attacks since November, all our intelligence indicates that previous sets of strikes have been successful in degrading military capabilities of the Houthis: targeting supply, command and control launch sites for missiles and there is also a risk in inaction that would damage the global economy and further risk our international security.\"\n\nThis comes after Iran's influence over the Middle East has been growing ever-stronger, amid the war in Gaza.\n\nIt has been financially and politically supporting proxies opposing Israel since the Hamas-launched October 7 attacks, including Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, the Houthis in Yemen, and elsewhere.\n\nRecently, a number of high-profile Iranian military and political leaders have been killed straining trust and relations further, and

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to provide early details of an ongoing military operation.\n\nAlso struck by the U.S. were eight air drones in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen and over the Red Sea that were determined to be presenting a threat to American and coalition forces.\n\nWhile the Navy reportedly engaged with fewer assets launched by the Yemen-based group in May than in some earlier months of the conflict, the sea service continues to be occupied by nearly daily interactions with the rebel organization, which kicked off its campaign of assaults in the fall after the war between Israel and Hamas began.\n\nAs of publishing time, U.S. and coalition forces destroyed, or tracked the firing, or the intent to launch, of at least 15 Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles, 38 air drones, a land attack cruise missile and two missile launchers in May that the Houthis launched or were prepared to use, according to a tally of incidents announced by U.S. Central Command, as well as reporting by Military Times and The Associated Press.\n\nThat all comes as at least three U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drones were purportedly downed in May alone, according to The Associated Press. While not immediately clear what brought down the drones, the outlet reported that U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations in the region, acknowledged seeing \"reports\" of the most recent incident.\n\nMeanwhile, the Navy destroyer Carney returned home after a lengthy deployment to the Middle Eastern waters, where the warship fended off, or participated in, at least a dozen incidents with the Houthis.\n\nJean-Loup Samaan, a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council, wrote recently that a key challenge for the White House in responding to the continued Houthi threat against international shipping in the Red Sea has been rallying its allies and partners. That in part reflects concerns from Europeans over strategic objectives with the U.S. operation, he said, as well frustration from Gulf countries over the conflict in Yemen, which predated the current circumstances in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.\n\n\"The U.S. supports peace in Yemen, but a peace agreement can only proceed after the Houthis stop their reckless attacks on international shipping in the Red Sea and surrounding waterways,\" State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said during a briefing in May.\n\n\"All of our partners are united around the need for Houthi attacks to cease before an agreement can be signed,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There were no injuries and the vessel continued on its journey to the Iranian port of Imam Khomeini.\n\nBritish Prime Minster Rishi Sunak said Friday that the airstrikes had been a last resort to prevent further following 'exhaustive diplomacy,\" vowing his government \"will not hesitate to protect our security.\"\n\n\"The strikes were taken in self-defense in the face of an ongoing threat that the Houthis pose.\"\n\nSunak said the action sent the Houthis \"a strong message\" that attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea was \"unacceptable\".\n\nThe MoD stressed the lengths the two militaries went to avoid hurting civilians or inflicting collateral damage.\n\n\"As ever, the utmost care was taken in planning the strikes to minimize any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure.

Describing their actions as solidarity with Palestinians, the Houthis have escalated missile strikes in busy waterways since November, impacting global shipping routes and causing significant disruptions.\n\nYemen's Houthis launched attacks on six ships in three different seas, the Iran-backed group said on Wednesday, including the Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier Laax that was damaged after reporting a missile strike off the Yemeni coast.\n\nThe Houthis attacked Laax in a barrage of attacks on Tuesday. They also targeted the Morea and Sealady in the Red Sea, the Alba and Maersk Hartford in the Arabian Sea and the Minerva Antonia in the Mediterranean, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised speech. The Houthis, who describe their attacks as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza, have launched repeated drone and missile strikes in the Red Sea region since November. They have since expanded attacks to other busy waterways.\n\nTuesday's Houthi attacks came as Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah for the first time - despite an order from the International Court of Justice to end its attacks on the city, where many Palestinians had taken refuge from bombardment elsewhere. Five missiles fired from Yemen struck the Laax, which was carrying grain, but the vessel was still able to sail to its destination and the crew were safe, the ship's security company, LSS-SAPU, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\n\"The vessel has sustained damage, she is not taking water, she is not tilting and there are no wounded onboard,\" a LSS-SAPU spokesperson said. \"She is proceeding to her destination with a normal speed.\"\n\nThe spokesperson with LSS-SAPU, which was responsible for evacuating the crew from the Rubymar ship which sank after being hit by a Houthi missile earlier this year, said Laax's Greece-based owner had no connection with Israel or the United States. The vessel last reported its position on May 28 with a destination of Bandar Imam Khomeini in Iran, LSEG shipping data showed.\n\nThe Houthis have promised to attack any ships sailing towards Israeli ports, even in the Mediterranean. They also have identified U.S. and UK-affiliated vessels as targets. The U.S.-flagged Maersk Hartford container ship appears to be the only vessel among the recently attacked with ties to nations the Houthis say they target, according to LSEG data. The Morea coal bulker and Sealady wheat carrier are Malta-flagged, the Minerva Antonia chemical tanker is Greek-flagged and the Alba coal carrier flies the flag of Portugal.\n\nRegistered owners for those vessels in LSEG's database are linked to addresses in the United States, Singapore, Malta, Germany and Greece, respectively. Reuters was not immediately able to reach those vessels' registered owners for comment. The Houthi campaign has sunk one ship, the Rubymar, and involved the seizure of another vessel, killed two crew members and disrupted global shipping by forcing vessels to avoid the nearby Suez Canal and reroute trade around Africa.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news",

This assault is part of an ongoing Houthi campaign in the Red Sea aimed at pressuring Israel and the West. French naval forces found no remaining explosives aboard the vessel after inspecting the damage.\n\nA Greek-owned, Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier that came under attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels earlier this week had a cargo of grain bound for Iran, the group's main benefactor, authorities said Thursday. The attack on the Laax comes as the Houthis continue their attacks on shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor, part of a campaign they say aims at pressuring Israel and the West over the war in Gaza. However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the rebels have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia. Initially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship. Images released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck. Tuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis. LSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement. The Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA. As many as three may have been lost this month alone.(AP) RUP RUP\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri":

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the rebels have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On May 30, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA search for deterrence in the Red Sea\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nMay 28's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nIsrael's 'limited' military operation in Rafah | Explained\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.

While some ships like the Maersk Hartford were unaffected, the attacks created significant disruption. The Houthis, targeting vessels linked to Israel and its allies, have intensified their campaign since November, complicating global shipping routes.\n\nYemen's Houthis launched attacks on six ships in three different seas, the Iran-backed group said on Wednesday, including the Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier Laax that was damaged after reporting a missile strike off the Yemeni coast. Security and shipping sources confirmed the Houthis hit the Laax in a barrage of attacks on Tuesday. In a televised speech, the group also said it targeted the Morea and Sealady in the Red Sea, the Alba and Maersk Hartford in the Arabian Sea and the Minerva Antonia in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe U.S.-flagged Maersk Hartford container ship was not the subject of a drone or missile attack, said Ed Hanley, chief operating officer of U.S.-based Maersk Line, which owns the vessel. \"I can't speak to the other five ships, but the Hartford is fine,\" Hanley said in a telephone interview. \"Nothing happened.\" Reuters was not immediately able to reach the registered owners of the other vessels for comment.\n\nThe Houthis, who describe their attacks as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza, have launched repeated drone and missile strikes in the Red Sea region since November. They have since expanded attacks to other busy waterways. Tuesday's Houthi attacks came as Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah for the first time - despite an order from the International Court of Justice to end its attacks on the city, where many Palestinians had taken refuge from bombardment elsewhere.\n\nFive missiles fired from Yemen struck the Laax, which was carrying grain, but the vessel was still able to sail to its destination and the crew were safe, the ship's security company, LSS-SAPU, told Reuters on Wednesday. \"The vessel has sustained damage, she is not taking water, she is not tilting and there are no wounded onboard,\" a LSS-SAPU spokesperson said.\n\n\"She is proceeding to her destination with a normal speed.\" The spokesperson with LSS-SAPU, which was responsible for evacuating the crew from the Rubymar ship which sank after being hit by a Houthi missile earlier this year, said Laax's Greece-based owner had no connection with Israel or the United States.\n\nThe vessel last reported its position on May 28 with a destination of Bandar Imam Khomeini in Iran, LSEG shipping data showed. The Houthis have promised to attack any ships sailing toward Israeli ports, even in the Mediterranean. They also have identified U.S. and UK-affiliated vessels as targets.\n\nThe Houthi campaign has sunk one ship, the Rubymar, and included the seizure of another vessel and the killing of three crew members in yet another attack. It has disrupted global shipping by forcing vessels to avoid the nearby Suez Canal and reroute trade around Africa.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the rebels have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nTuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there.

They called it a response to a recent surge in attacks by the Iran-backed militia group on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe U.S. F/A-18 fighter jets involved in the strikes took off from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, officials said. Other U.S. warships in the region also participated.\n\nBut the Houthis focused Friday morning on a strike they said struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried down stairs and others in the hospital, receiving aid.

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the rebels have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nTuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it.

They also targeted the Morea and Sealady in the Red Sea, the Alba and Maersk Hartford in the Arabian Sea and the Minerva Antonia in the Mediterranean, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised speech.\n\nThe Houthis, who describe their attacks as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza, have launched repeated drone and missile strikes in the Red Sea region since November. They have since expanded attacks to other busy waterways.\n\nTuesday's Houthi attacks came as Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah for the first time - despite an order from the International Court of Justice to end its attacks on the city, where many Palestinians had taken refuge from bombardment elsewhere.\n\nFive missiles fired from Yemen struck the Laax, which was carrying grain, but the vessel was still able to sail to its destination and the crew were safe, the ship's security company, LSS-SAPU, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\n\"The vessel has sustained damage, she is not taking water, she is not tilting and there are no wounded onboard,\" a LSS-SAPU spokesperson said.\n\n\"She is proceeding to her destination with a normal speed.\"\n\nThe spokesperson with LSS-SAPU, which was responsible for evacuating the crew from the Rubymar ship which sank after being hit by a Houthi missile earlier this year, said Laax's Greece-based owner had no connection with Israel or the United States.\n\nThe vessel last reported its position on 28 May with a destination of Bandar Imam Khomeini in Iran, LSEG shipping data showed.\n\nThe Houthis have promised to attack any ships sailing towards Israeli ports, even in the Mediterranean. They also have identified US and UK-affiliated vessels as targets.\n\nThe US-flagged Maersk Hartford container ship appears to be the only vessel among the recently attacked with ties to nations the Houthis say they target, according to LSEG data. The Morea coal bulker and Sealady wheat carrier are Malta-flagged, the Minerva Antonia chemical tanker is Greek-flagged and the Alba coal carrier flies the flag of Portugal.\n\nRegistered owners for those vessels in LSEG's database are linked to addresses in the United States, Singapore, Malta, Germany and Greece, respectively. Reuters was not immediately able to reach those vessels' registered owners for comment.\n\nThe Houthi campaign has sunk one ship, the Rubymar, and involved the seizure of another vessel, killed two crew members and disrupted global shipping by forcing vessels to avoid the nearby Suez Canal and reroute trade around Cape Town.", "source": {"uri": "news24.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Two children and four women were among the dead.\n\nPalestinians in the border city of Rafah have reported heavy fighting in recent days as Israel's military widened its offensive in the south, seizing control of the entire length of Gaza's border with Egypt. Fighting in Rafah has spurred more than 1 million Palestinians to flee, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war. They now seek refuge in makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the United Nations says.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nJoint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday. That's the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250.

Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nAIRSTRIKES TARGETING YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS KILL AT LEAST 16\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "clickorlando.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WKMG"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The strikes allegedly targeted civilian infrastructure and resulted in the deaths of 16 people and over 40 wounded.\n\nSeveral missiles allegedly struck a Hodeidah radio station building, as well as the area surrounding Al-Thawra Hospital and a Coast Guard headquarters in Port Al-Salib, where several commercial ships were damaged. \"This represents a clear targeting of civilian objects, a blatant violation of all international laws, and a full-fledged war crime. Therefore, in response to these crimes and the American-British aggression... the Yemeni armed forces carried out a joint military operation targeting the American aircraft carrier Eisenhower in the Red Sea,\" Saree said in his statement.\n\nHe claimed that the strike on the US aircraft carrier \"was accurate and direct,\" but did not give details on damage the vessel suffered.\n\nThe US Navy has not yet issued any statements regarding the purported attack on its ship.\n\nOn Thursday, British and American forces launched a large-scale attack on alleged Houthi targets in Yemen as part of an ongoing operation to halt the group's strikes on commercial ships traversing the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. According to media reports citing military officials, the coalition attacks hit multiple Houthi underground facilities, missile launchers, and command and control sites, as well as a Houthi ship and aerial vehicles in areas of Yemen said to be controlled by the militants.\n\nThe Houthis, a Shia Islamist group that controls a large part of Yemen, have been attacking merchant vessels since October, calling it an act of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.

Two children and four women were among the dead.\n\nPalestinians in the border city of Rafah have reported heavy fighting in recent days as Israel's military widened its offensive in the south, seizing control of the entire length of Gaza's border with Egypt. Fighting in Rafah has spurred more than 1 million Palestinians to flee, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war. They now seek refuge in makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the United Nations says.\n\nJoint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday. That's the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

They also targeted the Morea and Sealady in the Red Sea, the Alba and Maersk Hartford in the Arabian Sea and the Minerva Antonia in the Mediterranean, Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saree said in a televised speech.\n\nThe Houthis, who describe their attacks as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza, have launched repeated drone and missile strikes in the Red Sea region since November. They have since expanded attacks to other busy waterways.\n\nTuesday's Houthi attacks came as Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah for the first time - despite an order from the International Court of Justice to end its attacks on the city, where many Palestinians had taken refuge from bombardment elsewhere.\n\nFive missiles fired from Yemen struck the Laax, which was carrying grain, but the vessel was still able to sail to its destination and the crew were safe, the ship's security company, LSS-SAPU, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\n\"The vessel has sustained damage, she is not taking water, she is not tilting and there are no wounded onboard,\" a LSS-SAPU spokesperson said.\n\n\"She is proceeding to her destination with a normal speed.\"\n\nThe spokesperson with LSS-SAPU, which was responsible for evacuating the crew from the Rubymar ship which sank after being hit by a Houthi missile earlier this year, said Laax's Greece-based owner had no connection with Israel or the United States.\n\nThe vessel last reported its position on May 28 with a destination of Bandar Imam Khomeini in Iran, LSEG shipping data showed.\n\nThe Houthis have promised to attack any ships sailing towards Israeli ports, even in the Mediterranean.

The Morea coal bulker and Sealady wheat carrier are Malta-flagged, the Minerva Antonia chemical tanker is Greek-flagged and the Alba coal carrier flies the flag of Portugal.\n\nRegistered owners for those vessels in LSEG's database are linked to addresses in the United States, Singapore, Malta, Germany and Greece, respectively. Reuters was not immediately able to reach those vessels' registered owners for comment.\n\nThe Houthi campaign has sunk one ship, the Rubymar, and involved the seizure of another vessel, killed two

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the militia have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nTuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, another US MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The US Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

Two children and four women were among the dead.\n\nPalestinians in the border city of Rafah have reported heavy fighting in recent days as Israel's military widened its offensive in the south, seizing control of the entire length of Gaza's border with Egypt. Fighting in Rafah has spurred more than 1 million Palestinians to flee, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war. They now seek refuge in makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the United Nations says.\n\nJoint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday. That's the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Houthi rebels say at least 16 killed and 35 others wounded in joint U.S.-British airstrikes in Yemen.\n\n-- Slovenia's government endorses recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\n-- A pro-Palestinian camp at Wayne State is dismantled while MIT students walk out of commencement.\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA KILL AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nAIRSTRIKES TARGETING YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS KILL AT LEAST 16\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the terrorists have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nTuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, another U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The U.S. Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

Two children and four women were among the dead.\n\nPalestinians in the border city of Rafah have reported heavy fighting in recent days as Israel's military widened its offensive in the south, seizing control of the entire length of Gaza's border with Egypt. Fighting in Rafah has spurred more than 1 million Palestinians to flee, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war. They now seek refuge in makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the United Nations says.\n\nJoint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday. That's the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Houthi rebels say at least 16 killed and 35 others wounded in joint U.S.-British airstrikes in Yemen.\n\n-- Slovenia's government endorses recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\n-- A pro-Palestinian camp at Wayne State is dismantled while MIT students walk out of commencement.\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed.\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nAIRSTRIKES IN CENTRAL GAZA KILL AT LEAST A DOZEN PEOPLE\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nAIRSTRIKES TARGETING YEMEN'S HOUTHI REBELS KILL AT LEAST 16\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 35 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.\n\nMore from this section\n\nLocal West Virginia Business Owners Jessica and Martin Herbert Named to NSBA

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the rebels have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. On Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nTuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hours-long assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told the Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on October 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.\n\nOn Wednesday, another US MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it. The US Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA. As many as three may have been lost this month alone.

The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that\u00b4s held Yemen\u00b4s capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites - likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis\u00b4 secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels\u00b4 main benefactor.\n\nA Palestinian moves a wounded child in an Israeli bombardment on the Gaza Strip to Al Aqsa hospital in Deir al Balah, central Gaza Strip, late Thursday, May 30, 2024.

Two children and four women were among the dead.\n\nAt least a dozen people were killed in two airstrikes Friday in central Gaza. Two children and four women were among the dead.\n\nPalestinians in the border city of Rafah have reported heavy fighting in recent days as Israel's military widened its offensive in the south, seizing control of the entire length of Gaza's border with Egypt. Fighting in Rafah has spurred more than 1 million Palestinians to flee, most of whom had already been displaced earlier in the war. They now seek refuge in makeshift tent camps and other war-ravaged areas, where they lack shelter, food, water and other essentials for survival, the United Nations says.\n\nJoint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday. That's the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians.\n\nIsrael launched its war in Gaza after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack in which militants stormed into southern Israel, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and abducted about 250. Israel says around 100 hostages are still captive in Gaza, along with the bodies of around 30 more.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Houthi rebels say at least 16 killed and 42 others wounded in joint U.S.-British airstrikes in Yemen\n\n-- Slovenia's government endorses recognition of a Palestinian state\n\n-- A pro-Palestinian camp at Wayne State is dismantled while MIT students walk out of commencement\n\n-- A global aid group asks warring forces to respect its neutrality, saying 24 of its aid workers have been killed\n\nFollow AP's coverage of the war in Gaza at https://apnews.com/hub/israel-hamas-war\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel -- Israel's army said Friday that it completed its mission in part of the Gaza Strip's northern city of Jabaliya and will continue operations in other parts of the enclave.\n\nThe army said during its operations in eastern Jabaliya that it killed hundreds of fighters, destroyed dozens of targets and combat compounds and located hundreds of weapons.\n\nIt also said it destroyed more than 10 kilometers (6 miles) of underground tunnels and retrieved the bodies of seven hostages and returned them to their families in Israel.\n\nIsraeli troops returned to Jabaliya and the surrounding areas in northern Gaza in early May, months after an earlier operation. The United Nations said that about 100,000 Palestinians were displaced in northern Gaza following Israel's evacuation orders.\n\nNorthern Gaza was the first target of Israel's ground offensive launched after Hamas and other militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people.\n\nIsraeli troops have relaunched attacks in the north as Hamas repeatedly returns to areas that Israel withdraws from.\n\nDEIR AL-BALAH -- At least a dozen people were killed, including children, in two airstrikes Friday in Central Gaza, according to hospital officials and Associated Press journalists who counted the bodies.\n\nThe strikes hit Nuseirat and Bureij, two children and four women were among those killed and the bodies were brought to the Al Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\n\nA funeral for all 12 people was held Friday.\n\nIsrael's campaign of bombardment and offensives in Gaza has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 80,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between civilians and combatants.\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Joint British-United States airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels killed at least 16 people and wounded 42 others, the rebels said Friday -- the highest publicly acknowledged death toll from the multiple rounds of strikes carried out over the rebels' attacks on shipping.\n\nThe Houthis have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. It said all the dead and nearly all the wounded from the strikes came from there.\n\nThe Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press couldn't immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck. One person was wounded in Sanaa.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "wral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WRAL"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They did not say exactly when the attacks took place and they did not name the two U.S. destroyers they claim to have targeted with drones.\n\nThe Largo Desert is an oil and chemicals tanker sailing under the flag of the Marshall Islands. The Mechela appeared to be a container ship flagged from Portugal. The Minerva Lisa is a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of Liberia.\n\nThe Houthis claim their piracy is conducted on behalf of the Palestinians in Gaza and they are supposedly targeting ships owned by, or doing business with, Israel and the United States. They have attacked numerous vessels that did not meet any of those criteria, however.\n\nIranian state media quoted Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree describing the Larego Desert as an \"American\" ship and the Mechela as an \"Israeli\" vessel. He did not elaborate on why the Minerva Lisa was targeted.\n\nRELATED: U.S. Forces Strikes Houthi Targets in Red Sea Show of Defense\n\nMaritime tracking experts noted there does not appear to be a ship named Mechela, or anything close to that name, operating in the Red Sea or Indian Ocean. The Portuguese ship with a similar name, Michela, is currently sailing through the Atlantic Ocean en route to Brazil.\n\nSaree claimed the drone \"hits\" on two American destroyers in the Red Sea were \"accurate.\"\n\nU.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) reported a Houthi anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM) launch on Saturday with no injuries or damage and a drone launch from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Sunday.\n\nCENTCOM said the uncrewed aerial system (UAS) launched on Sunday was deemed an \"imminent threat to merchant vessels in the region\" and destroyed.\n\n\"This continued malign and reckless behavior by the Iranian backed Houthis threatens regional stability and endangers the lives of mariners across the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,\" CENTCOM said. The U.S. military offered no further comment on the Houthi claims.\n\nOn Tuesday, UKMTO reported what appears to be another Houthi attack, this one apparently inflicting significant damage on a civilian vessel in the southern Red Sea near Yemen's port city of Hodeidah.\n\nHodeidah is close to the Bab el-Mandeb Strait linking the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden, an area that has seen many Houthi attacks on shipping.\n\nA maritime security firm called Ambrey picked up radio signals from the stricken vessel, saying that it \"sustained damage to the cargo hold\" and was \"taking on water.\"\n\nThe location of the attack matched up with a Marshall Islands-flagged, Greek-managed bulk carrier called the Laax, which was en route to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\n\"The crew are reported safe and the vessel is proceeding to its next port of call,\" UKMTO said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri":

However, as shipping through that artery has dropped during the months of attacks, the rebels have struck vessels associated with Iran, as well as Tehran's economic lifelines of China and Russia.\n\nInitially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. Yesterday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck.\n\nTuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press. LSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis.\n\nLSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration.", "source": {"uri": "macaudailytimes.com.mo", "dataType": "news", "title": "Macau Daily

The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nHouthis said Friday morning that one of the strikes struck a building housing Hodeida Radio and civilian homes in the port city on the Red Sea. Their Al Masirah satellite news channel aired images of one bloodied man being carried downstairs and others receiving aid in the hospital. The Houthis described all those killed and hurt in Hodeida as civilians, something The Associated Press could not immediately confirm. The rebel force that's held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, since 2014 includes fighters who often are not in uniform.\n\nOther strikes hit outside of Sanaa near its airport and communication equipment in Taiz, the broadcaster said. Little other information was released on those sites -- likely signaling that Houthi military sites had been struck.\n\nThe U.S. and the U.K. have launched strikes against the Houthis since January. Abdul Malik al-Houthi, the Houthis' secretive supreme leader, offered an overall death toll for the strikes up to that point as 40 people killed and 35 others wounded. He did not offer a breakdown between civilian and combatant casualties at the time.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the U.S. Maritime Administration. This week, they attacked a ship carrying grain to Iran, the rebels' main benefactor.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In a televised speech, the group also said it targeted the Morea and Sealady in the Red Sea, the Alba and Maersk Hartford in the Arabian Sea and the Minerva Antonia in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe U.S.-flagged Maersk Hartford container ship was not the subject of a drone or missile attack, said Ed Hanley, chief operating officer of U.S.-based Maersk Line, which owns the vessel.\n\n\"I can't speak to the other five ships, but the Hartford is fine,\" Hanley said in a telephone interview. \"Nothing happened.\"\n\nReuters was not immediately able to reach the registered owners of the other vessels for comment.\n\nThe Houthis, who describe their attacks as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's war in Gaza, have launched repeated drone and missile strikes in the Red Sea region since November. They have since expanded attacks to other busy waterways.\n\nTuesday's Houthi attacks came as Israeli tanks moved into the heart of Rafah for the first time - despite an order from the International Court of Justice to end its attacks on the city, where many Palestinians had taken refuge from bombardment elsewhere.\n\nFive missiles fired from Yemen struck the Laax, which was carrying grain, but the vessel was still able to sail to its destination and the crew were safe, the ship's security company, LSS-SAPU, told Reuters on Wednesday.\n\n\"The vessel has sustained damage, she is not taking water, she is not tilting and there are no wounded onboard,\" a LSS-SAPU spokesperson said.\n\n\"She is proceeding to her destination with a normal speed.\"\n\nThe spokesperson with LSS-SAPU, which was responsible for evacuating the crew from the Rubymar ship which sank after being hit by a Houthi missile earlier this year, said Laax's Greece-based owner had no connection with Israel or the United States.\n\nThe vessel last reported its position on May 28 with a destination of Bandar Imam Khomeini in Iran, LSEG shipping data showed.\n\nThe Houthis have promised to attack any ships sailing toward Israeli ports, even in the Mediterranean. They also have identified U.S. and UK-affiliated vessels as targets.\n\nThe Houthi campaign has sunk one ship, the Rubymar, and included the seizure of another vessel and the killing of three crew members in yet another attack. It has disrupted global shipping by forcing vessels to avoid the nearby Suez Canal and reroute trade around Africa.\n\nReporting by Nayera Abdallah and Clauda Tanios in Dubai, Jonathan Saul in London

Initially after the attack, the Laax had listed its destination as Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nOn Thursday, however, its listed destination instead appeared to be Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nAlso Read | Iran opens registration period for the presidential election after Raisi's death\n\nA statement released by French naval forces based in the UAE that patrol the Middle East also identified the vessel's grain shipment as being bound for Iran. It said that a team from Djibouti had inspected the damage caused by the attack, which it said involved both drones and missiles, and found no remaining dangerous explosives onboard the ship.\n\nImages released by the French navy showed damage both at the waterline of the vessel, as well as on its deck. Tuesday's attack saw five missiles hit the Laax during the hourslong assault, the private security firm LSS-SAPU told The Associated Press.\n\nLSS-SAPU, which earlier helped evacuate mariners from the Houthi-attacked Rubymar that later sunk, said there had been no prior warning by radio from the Houthis. LSS-SAPU had three armed security guards onboard the Laax at the time of the attack. Among the ship's crew were 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers said in a statement.\n\nAlso Read | From Iran to India: 6 men, a fishing boat and a daring getaway on the high seas\n\nThe Houthis in recent months have stepped up attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, demanding that Israel end the war in Gaza, which has killed more than 36,000 Palestinians there. The war began after Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking around 250 hostage.\n\nThe Houthis have launched more than 50 attacks on shipping, killed three sailors, seized one vessel and sunk another since November, according to the US Maritime Administration.On Wednesday, another US MQ-9 Reaper drone apparently crashed in Yemen, with the Houthis claiming they fired a surface-to-air missile at it.\n\nThe US Air Force didn't report any aircraft missing, leading to suspicion that the drone may have been piloted by the CIA.

AP File\n\nAs the tensions in the Middle East continue to escalate, the US and the UK have carried out a series of strikes against Iran-backed Houthis for the first time in more than three months.\n\nIn a statement following the attack, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) stated that the attack took place on Saturday. In addition to this, the body noted that the United States has unilaterally destroyed eight aerial attack drones over Yemen and the Red Sea.\n\nIn the recent attack, the coalition strikes targeted 13 Houthi targets in parts of Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed militant group. This marked the fifth round of coalition strikes against the Houthis who have notoriously attacked several navy ships and commercial vessels following the commencement of the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe last strike the two nations conducted was on February 24 when both the US and the UK targeted Houthi's weapons and radar sites.\n\nUS plans to disrupt Houthi's target abilities\n\nThroughout the course of tensions between the Houthis and the West, the United States has tried to disrupt Houthi's ability to target commercial vessels and US warships by going after their primary weapons, including anti-ship cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and one-way attack drones.\n\nAs a part of this endeavour, the US has also destroyed maritime drones and underwater drones. It is pertinent to note that the resumption of the strikes follows an uptick in Houthi attacks over the last week.\n\nEarlier this week, the US intercepted the Yemeni group's aerial attack and eventually destroyed the militant group's missile launchers. The US has also destroyed the maritime drones and underwater drones that were being used by the group in the region.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, three Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles struck a Greek-owned and operated merchant ship in the Red Sea. However, there were no injuries and the M/V Lax was able to continue its voyage.\n\nIn December last year, the United States spearheaded Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect international maritime navigation. Under the operation, it branded together with other nations to intercept Houthi attacks. Recently, the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and a number of destroyers have patrolled the waters of the region to intercept Houthi launches.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Central_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Central Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_underwater_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned underwater vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballistic_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballistic missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-ship_missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-ship missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merchant ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_launcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rocket launcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Mr. Sare'e said one person was injured in one of the strikes inside Sana'a, while another 41 were wounded and 16 were killed during the six strikes across the Hodeidah Governorate.\n\nThe U.S. government, across multiple presidential administrations, has waivered over whether to classify the Houthis as a terrorist group.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's administration had provided U.S. military logistical and targeting support for a Saudi Arabian-led military coalition fighting against the Houthis, though his administration did not elect to designate them as a terrorist group.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration continued U.S. support for the Saudi-led counter-Houthi coalition throughout his presidency but only moved to designate the Houthis as a specially designated global terrorist (SDGT) and as a foreign terrorist organization (FTO) in his final days in office.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's administration reversed the Trump-era terror designations against the Houthis within days of taking office.\n\nThe Biden administration may again change course with the Houthis. Announcing the decision to add the Houthis to the SDGT list, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the move was intended to \"promote accountability for the group's terrorist activities\" but said the United States \"will reevaluate this designation\" if the attacks stopped.\n\n\"My hope as the envoy for Yemen is that we can find diplomatic offramps to find ways to de-escalate and allow us to pull back eventually the designation and of course to end the military strikes on Houthis' military capability,\" Mr. Lenderking told reporters on April 3.\n\nAnnouncing the casualties from the joint U.S.-U.K. strikes on Friday, Mr. Sare'e said the Houthi attacks will continue \"until the aggression stops and the siege on the oppressed Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.\"",

The video included photos of what appeared to be a crashed Reaper in the desert, with its tail assembly separated and one of its hatches opened.\n\nThe footage also depicted Houthi fighters celebrating the shootdown by standing atop the crashed drone. The alleged Reaper appeared intact, raising the possibility that the Houthis will pass it along to their patrons in Iran, who have a history of reverse-engineering advanced technology from other countries to improve their own drone weapons.\n\nIf the Houthi claim is confirmed, it would be the sixth Reaper drone destroyed by the insurgents and the third downed in the past month alone. There has not yet been any confirmation of the shootdown from outside sources, including the government of Marib province, which is aligned with the legitimate government of Yemen.\n\nAn unnamed U.S. defense official told the Associated Press (AP) on Wednesday that \"the U.S. Air Force has not lost any aircraft operating within U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility.\"\n\nThe AP saw this as a carefully worded denial because other agencies besides the Air Force have been known to operate Reapers over Yemen, including the CIA. The drone seen in the Houthi footage did not have any identifying markings on its fuselage.\n\nOn Thursday, French naval officials based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the Greek-owned, Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship Laax, damaged by Houthi missiles on Tuesday, was carrying a shipment of grain bound for Iran. This would be awkward for the Houthis, who have been extensively funded and armed by the terror masters of Tehran.\n\nThe Laax was originally listed in maritime tracking databases as bound for the port of Fujairah in the UAE. As of Thursday, however, its destination was listed as Bandar-e Emam Khomeyni in Iran. The French Navy confirmed this was the correct destination for the ship and its cargo.\n\nFrench officials released photos of the Laax that showed significant damage at the waterline and on deck. According to a team of inspectors dispatched from Djibouti, both Houthi drones and missiles hit the ship. The inspectors found no further undetonated ordnance aboard the vessel, a major concern before allowing it to complete its journey.\n\nA private security firm called LSS-SAPU, which has worked with previous Houthi attack victims and had armed guards stationed aboard the Laax, said at least five missiles hit the ship during an assault that lasted for hours.\n\nAn assault of such intensity and duration would be another black eye for President Joe Biden's \"Operation Prosperity Guardian,\" a multinational security initiative that was supposed to protect international shipping from the Houthis.\n\nThe Houthis have declared their intention to attack American and Israeli ships, as well as ships bound for Israel, to pressure the Israelis to end their military operation against Hamas, another terrorist client of Iran. Houthi target selection has proven slipshod over the past eight months, as they have attacked numerous ships that did not fit their declared criteria, including other ships bound for Iran.", "source":

militia reported on Friday.\n\nAt least 34 others were injured in the overnight strikes, al-Masirah TV said, citing a local official in the militia-controlled province.\n\nThe broadcaster said the strikes had targeted the provincial radio building and al-Salif port in Hodaidah.\n\nThe US army said its forces destroyed eight uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen and over the Red Sea on Thursday.\n\nThe Central Command added in an X post that the US and UK forces had also struck 13 Houthi targets, saying the UAVs and sites \"presented a threat\" to US and coalition forces and merchant vessels in the region.\n\nThe Houthis, who have controlled parts of Yemen since 2014, have been targeting ships bound for Israeli ports or those owned by Israeli companies in the Red and Arabian seas and Indian Ocean for months in what they say is retaliation for Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe militia also attacked US and UK ships off Yemen after the two countries began launching strikes on areas under the group's control.\n\nThe US, UK, and other Western countries have launched operations to protect ships in the region.\n\nThe European Union has also deployed a military operation to secure merchant shipping in the Red Sea, one of the most important shipping routes for world trade, as it connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Indian Ocean

Furthermore, a set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, had also been identified as being involved in the command and control of their anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRoyal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s therefore conducted strikes on the target buildings at these three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs.

They claimed attacks in the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean on a total of six ships while Iran's Tasmin News Agency reports the Houthis have a new missile based on an Iranian design.\n\nThe article from the semi-official Iranian news agency says that the Houthis now have a missile based on the Iranian Ghadr. They claimed greater accuracy but did not discuss range while saying the missile is fitted with an \"optical seeker\" to target ships. Independent reports said the ballistic missile can also be fired from sea. Tasmin said it was an advancement on the Thunder 69 missile which was Chinese with a range of 150 km (93 miles).\n\nThe United States has repeatedly accused Iran of arming the Houthis. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to an inquiry from Reuters about the Tasmin report.\n\nWhile the Houthis alleged a barrage of attacks only one has been confirmed by the international forces. That was the multiple missile assault on the Greek-owned bulker Laax, which was hit twice on Tuesday. It is believed that at least five missiles were fired at the one ship with U.S. Central Command confirming it was stuck by three anti-ship ballistic missiles. The Houthis and others all said there was severe damage.\n\nA spokesperson for a security firm told Reuters that the Laax was damaged but denied the reports that the vessel was listing. Independent reports yesterday said the vessel was taking on water in one of its cargo holds. The spokesperson told Reuters the vessel is loaded with grain and while damaged is proceeding at a normal speed. The French command is reporting that one of its vessels assisted the Laax. They are saying there were several leaks aboard the vessel and that a French mine clearance team stationed in Djibouti, reinforced by Italian soldiers, carried out an inspection of the impact zones to ensure the absence of residual dangerous materials.\n\nFrench forces inspected the Laax ans escorted it from the danger zone (FFEAU.ALINDIEN)\n\nThe Philippines' Department of Migrant Workers reported that it had been in touch with the shipping agent and confirmed that the 13 Filipino crewmembers were uninjured. They said they had been told, \"the bombing caused severe damage.\" Separately, the Joint Maritime Information Center however said it had been informed that one crewmember on the Laax was injured, but they did not identify the nationality.\n\nAlso in the Red Sea, the Houthis reported targeting two Greek-owned bulkers both registered in Malta and managed by Eastern Mediterranean Maritime. The Morea built in 2015 is 63,280 dwt and reports it is traveling from Russia to India. The Sealady was built in 2016 and is 60,436 dwt and is displaying a message on her AIS saying guards are aboard with a Russian cargo.\n\nIn the Arabian Sea, the Houthis reported targeting two \"American\" ships. The Alba, a 91,972-dwt bulker is registered in Portugal and reported managed by Peter Doehle in Germany. She is reported heading from the UAE to Algeria. The Maersk Hartford (84,783 dwt) is one of the U.S. registered containerships operated by Maersk Line Ltd. and was last reported rounding Africa on a trip from Spain to the UAE.\n\nFinally, the Houthis also claimed their second attack on a vessel in the Mediterranean. The Minerva Antonia (46,923 dwt) is a Greek-registered product reported in the anchorage in Egypt. Last week, the Houthis also claimed an attack on another vessel which was reported to be the anchorage in Egypt.\n\nCENTCOM however reported that its forces destroyed five drones over the Red Sea overnight. They did not report additional attacks on specific vessels nor did the UK Maritime Trade Organizations.", "source": {"uri": "maritime-executive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Maritime

Furthermore, a set of Houthi facilities at Ghulayfiqah, further south on the Yemeni coast, had also been identified as being involved in the command and control of their anti-shipping campaign.\n\nRoyal Air Force Typhoon FGR4s therefore conducted strikes on the target buildings at these three locations, using Paveway IV guided bombs. As ever, the utmost care was taken in planning the strikes to minimise any risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure. Conducting the strikes in the hours of darkness should also have mitigated yet further any such risks.

Eisenhower (CVN-69), which recently returned to the Red Sea after a brief deployment to the Eastern Mediterranean. The Houthis said their attack was in response to strikes carried out by aircraft launched from the carrier on targets in Yemen on Thursday.\n\nYahya Saree, the Houthi's military spokesman, said in a statement to the media that 16 people were killed and 41 others - including civilians - had been injured in the U.S. and UK-led strikes.\n\nThe UK Ministry of Defence had confirmed that two locations near Hudaydah had been targeted after it was determined the buildings were housing ground control facilities and the drones employed in the Houthi's anti-shipping attacks. The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) announced that U.S. and British forces successfully struck 13 targets in Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has not confirmed that the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower came under any attack. The aircraft carrier and units of her carrier strike group (IKECSG) departed their homeports of Norfolk, Virginia, and Mayport, Florida, on Oct. 13 & 14 for a scheduled deployment to the region, and since last fall conducted operations as part of the U.S. 5th Fleet in the Red Sea, Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, Gulf of Aden and Arabian Gulf including Operation Prosperity Guardian and self-defensive strikes into Iranian-backed Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\n\nOver its lengthy service history, the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has been deployed to a litany of combat operations. The ship's first deployment was dubbed Operation Eagle Claw during the 1980 Iran hostage crisis. One of the carrier's most notable deployments took place during Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and it was during that deployment that she became the second nuclear-powered carrier ever to transit the Suez Canal - making this recent deployment to the Red Sea all the more noteworthy.\n\nThe carrier strike group remains in the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command/U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to support maritime security and stability in the Middle East region. CVN-69 has been deployed for more than 200 days as of the beginning of May, and will likely remain in the Red Sea a bit longer.\n\nAccording to USNI News, the last three U.S. Navy flattops to be deployed from the East Coast since December 2021 have averaged 267 days deployed.\n\nThis is a developing story.", "source": {"uri": "nationalinterest.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Interest"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "USS Dwight D.

The Houthis' offensive is part of a broader strategy to exert pressure on Israel and Western nations amid the Gaza conflict. Despite the region's volatile state, the Laax initially reported its destination as Fujairah, UAE, before redirecting to Bandar Khomeini, Iran.\n\nFrench naval forces stationed in the UAE disclosed that an inspection team from Djibouti assessed the Laax's damages, confirming the absence of hazardous explosives after the attack, which involved drones and missiles. The French navy's imagery depicted significant damage to the ship's structure.\n\nThe security firm LSS-SAPU, engaged in the vessel's defence, recounted the ordeal, noting that five missiles struck the Laax in a prolonged attack without any forewarning from the insurgents. The firm, previously involved in the evacuation of another Houthi-targeted vessel, had stationed three armed guards on the Laax, which was manned by a crew comprising 13 Filipinos and one Ukrainian, as per the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers.\n\nThe Houthi faction has intensified its maritime assaults, demanding cessation of the Gaza war, which has resulted in substantial Palestinian casualties. The conflict escalated following an attack by Hamas-led militants on Israel last October.\n\nThe US Maritime Administration has recorded over 50 Houthi-initiated maritime attacks, including the capture and sinking of vessels, and the loss of sailors' lives since the previous November.\n\nIn a related incident, a US MQ-9 Reaper drone reportedly crashed in Yemen on Wednesday, with Houthis claiming responsibility for downing it with a missile. The absence of reports of missing aircraft from the US Air Force has fueled speculation about the drone's operators, with losses mounting this month.

The Ike has run flight operations from the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which is at a greater remove from Houthi missiles.\n\nThe Eisenhower, a Nimitz-class carrier, is a lead ship in the US Navy's response to the Houthis attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea, and its aircraft have been involved in strikes on the rebel group in Yemen as well as intercepting missile and drone threats.\n\nSince the carrier's strike group -- which consists of the Ike, the destroyers USS Gravely and Mason and the cruiser Philippine Sea -- first arrived in the Red Sea, they've engaged with Houthis forces in a high-tempo combat environment, defending shipping lanes for relentless attacks.\n\nThe Eisenhower and Gravely recently made a port visit in Greece to rearm as US intelligence suggests the conflict with the Houthis may continue on with no end in sight.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_panella@yahoo.com", "name": "Chris Panella", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aircraft carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yemen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Yemen"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USS Dwight D.

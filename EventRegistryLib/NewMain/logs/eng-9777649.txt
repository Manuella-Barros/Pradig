A talented hitter and a plus glove, Paredes has several years of control after this, so this is a long-term move for the Cubs. Can the 16 home run hitter from Tampa Bay start hot with his new team?\n\nCincinnati Reds\n\nElly De La Cruz: De La Cruz is one of the most entertaining watches in baseball, hitting .263 with an MLB high 55 steals to his name. He got the day off on Monday in the Reds 7-1 win, can he make an impact quickly against Steele and the Cubs?\n\nChicago Cubs vs. Cincinnati Reds Prediction and Pick\n\nJustin Steele has struggled out of the All-Star break, posting a 6.30 ERA in two starts, but this matchup against the Reds should suit him well, a team that is 23rd in OPS against southpaws.\n\nSteele has looked the part against Cincy this season especially, allowing two earned runs in 12 innings pitched against the NL Central foe.\n\nBoth teams are struggling since the All-Star break offensively, both bottom five in OPS over the last few weeks. The Cubs are hitting below .200, .199 since the break, but the Reds aren't much better at 2.06.\n\nThe key is Steele's arm against Nick Martinez, who has operated as an opener or a long reliever this season. He has been good, posting a 3.77 ERA with elite underlying metrics, but the Reds bullpen as a whole is bottom half of the bigs in ERA, which makes me confident the Cubs can scrape together a complete effort and win.\n\nPICK: Cubs ML (-146)\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.\n\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem and wants help, call 1-800-GAMBLER.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Cubs vs. Reds Prediction, Odds and Probable Pitchers for Tuesday, July 30.", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reed_wallach@theolympian.com", "name": "Reed Wallach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Alcoholic_Beverages", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Alcoholic Beverages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Reviews", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/4lijao/picture290573909/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/8f02e8a6-486c-4f53-84ec-10ec56fd78f2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777649", "eventUri": "eng-9777649", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-30", "textStart": 2367, "textEnd": 2374}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

He has owned the Reds to date this season and will look to welcome new addition Isaac Parades to the lineup with a stellar start.\n\nHere's our betting preview for Cubs vs. Reds on Tuesday.\n\nIsaac Paredes: Paredes was a deadline add for the Cubs, set to make his debut on Tuesday. A talented hitter and a plus glove, Paredes has several years of control after this, so this is a long-term move for the Cubs. Can the 16 home run hitter from Tampa Bay start hot with his new team?\n\nElly De La Cruz: De La Cruz is one of the most entertaining watches in baseball, hitting .263 with an MLB high 55 steals to his name. He got the day off on Monday in the Reds 7-1 win, can he make an impact quickly against Steele and the Cubs?\n\nJustin Steele has struggled out of the All-Star break, posting a 6.30 ERA in two starts, but this matchup against the Reds should suit him well, a team that is 23rd in OPS against southpaws.\n\nSteele has looked the part against Cincy this season especially, allowing two earned runs in 12 innings pitched against the NL Central foe.\n\nBoth teams are struggling since the All-Star break offensively, both bottom five in OPS over the last few weeks. The Cubs are hitting below .200, .199 since the break, but the Reds aren't much better at 2.06.\n\nThe key is Steele's arm against Nick Martinez, who has operated as an opener or a long reliever this season. He has been good, posting a 3.77 ERA with elite underlying metrics, but the Reds bullpen as a whole is bottom half of the bigs in ERA, which makes me confident the Cubs can scrape together a complete effort and win.\n\nPICK: Cubs ML (-146)\n\nGame odds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Steele", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Mays", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie Mays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stolen base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4972,h_2796,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j426na1xrdr2t34dzt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777649", "eventUri": "eng-9777649", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

He struck out two.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Nick Martinez has had more success on the road than at home where he is 2-3 with a 4.70 ERA and 1.36 WHIP.\n\nAs the Chicago Cubs head to Cincinnati to face the Reds on Tuesday night, the pitching matchup between Justin Steele and Nick Martinez will be pivotal.\n\nJustin Steele has been a standout performer for the Cubs this season. With a 3.08 ERA and a WHIP of 1.06, Steele has consistently shut down opposing lineups. His recent form is particularly impressive, as he has posted a 1.65 ERA over his last seven starts, including a dominant seven-inning, scoreless outing against Baltimore. Steele's ability to limit baserunners and generate strikeouts makes him a formidable opponent for any team.\n\nOn the other side, Nick Martinez has struggled with consistency this season, sporting a 4.70 ERA at home. Montas has been particularly vulnerable early in games, often finding himself in high-stress situations that the Cubs' potent lineup can exploit. His inconsistency presents a significant challenge against a Cubs team that has shown offensive prowess.\n\nWhile the Cubs have a mixed record against the Reds this season (2-5), their all-time success (1,203-1,178) and recent offensive output suggest they can capitalize on Montas' vulnerabilities. The Cubs have scored 92 runs in their last 20 games against the Reds, while Cincinnati has managed just 69 runs in the same span. This offensive edge will be crucial in supporting Steele's efforts on the mound.\n\nThe Cubs' lineup, featuring key hitters like Nico Hoerner and Ian Happ, has the firepower to take advantage of Montas' struggles. Their ability to generate runs and provide run support for Steele will be a decisive factor in this matchup.\n\nThe combination of Justin Steele's stellar pitching, Frankie Montas' inconsistencies, and the Cubs' recent offensive success against the Reds makes Chicago the favorite to win on Tuesday night. Expect Steele to lead the way as the Cubs aim to secure a crucial road victory.\n\nWhy The Reds Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nAs the Cincinnati Reds gear up to host the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday night, the pitching matchup between Nick Martinez and Justin Steele will be a key factor.\n\nNick Martinez, with a 3.77 ERA this season, has shown flashes of brilliance. His most recent outing was particularly promising, allowing no runs in two innings in relief against the Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nThe Reds hold a 25-28 record at home this season, demonstrating their ability to compete in front of their fans, especially against division rivals. The familiar environment and supportive crowd often give the Reds an extra edge, which could be crucial against a Cubs team that has struggled on the road with a 24-31 record.\n\nCincinnati boasts a roster filled with emerging talent, including outfielder TJ Friedl and infielder Elly De La Cruz. These young players have the potential to capitalize on any mistakes made by Steele. De La Cruz, in particular, has been a spark plug for the Reds' offense, providing timely hitting and speed on the bases.\n\nThe Cubs have had a tough time away from Wrigley Field, holding a 24-31 road record this season. Additionally, Justin Steele will be facing the Reds for the second time in July after a previous loss, which could add pressure on him against a hot Reds lineup.\n\nThe combination of Frankie Montas' potential to dominate at home, the Reds' home field advantage, and their emerging talent makes Cincinnati the favorite to win on Tuesday night. Expect Montas to lead the way as the Reds aim to secure a crucial victory against the Cubs.\n\nFinal Cubs-Reds Prediction & Pick\n\nJustin Steele and the Cubs will edge out Nick Martinez and the Reds in their upcoming matchup. Steele has been a more consistent starter this season, boasting a solid 3.08 ERA compared to Martinez's role primarily as a reliever. Steele's ability to go deeper into games and his higher strikeout rate (23.1% vs. 19.1% for Martinez) give the Cubs a significant advantage. Additionally, the Cubs' offense has shown more power potential, which could be the difference-maker in a close game as the Cubs come away with the win on the road Tuesday night.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_kerman@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Garrett Kerman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Steele", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wrigley Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Rays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Rays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Happ", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Happ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Metals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Metals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cubs-vs.-Reds-prediction-odds-pick-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777649", "eventUri": "eng-9777649", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

He had a career day at the plate tallying four hits, a home run and two RBI. Espinal's four-hit game was the first of his major league career. He also extended his hit streak to 10 games in the win.\n\nDespite playing in just his fourth game since the All-Star break, Espinal is 17-31 (.548) with three doubles, three home runs and eight RBI in his last 10 games.\n\nTJ Friedl gave Cincinnati an early 2-0 lead in the first inning.

The Cubs are helpless against the National League Central, a 13 and 25 record.\n\nThe Reds are 14-14, thanks to those seven wins against the Cubs.\n\nIt was a career night for Cincinnati's part-time infielder Santiago Espinal. Posing as the designated hitter and batting ninth, Espinal went a career-best 4-for-4 with a home run, two doubles and a single.\n\nEspinal, clearly the hottest hitter on the roster, extended his hitting streak to 10 games in the second inning when he punched a two-run GABP-type home run, 341 feet just inside the foul pole in right field.\n\nKnown for his glue glove, Espinal is capable of hot streaks. He once put together a 16-game hitting streak with Toronto.\n\nHe led off the fourth with a double and reached third but didn't score. He beat an infield single in the fifth, but didn't score.\n\nThen he doubled, just missing a second home run, leading off the eighth and scored a big insurance run on Spencer Steer's two-out double.\n\nTyler Stephenson helped out with three hits. He singled on the first pitch he saw from Steele in the first and scored a run. He singled again on the first pitch from Steele in the second, driving in a run.\n\nAnd the return to the lineup of TJ Friedl has proved beneficial to the Reds. His two-run single in the first scored two and gave the Reds a 2-0 lead. He added a walk and another single to the Reds' 12-hit attack.\n\nFrankie Montas was the scheduled starter, but when he was shipped off to Milwaukee, manager David Bell made it another Bullpen Day.\n\nTony Santillan started and pitched a scoreless first, Nick Martinez, he of the dancing feet, followed with four scoreless four-hit innings, protecting the 5-0 lead.\n\nThen it got shaky.\n\nLyon Richardson, just called up from Triple-A Louisville, started the sixth and gave up a leadoff single to Seiya Suzuki. Cody Bellinger, just off the injured list, had one homer in his last 30 games.\n\nNow he has two in 31 games, a drive just over the right field wall, cutting the Reds lead to 5-2.\n\nJustin Wilson was on the mound to start the seventh and issued a walk. With two outs, Fernando Cruz, much-troubled lately, replaced him.\n\nHe walked Suzuki on four pitches and gave up a single to Bellinger to load the bases.\n\nThat brought up Isaac Paredes, playing his first game with the Cubs after he was obtained via trade from Tampa Bay. Cruz threw a wild pitch to score a run and it was 5-3.\n\nBut with runners on third and second, Cruz retired Paredes on a soft liner to shortstop Elly De La Cruz.\n\nBuck Farmer pitched a 1-2-3 eighth with a pair of strikeouts. Closer Alexis Diaz walked pinch-hitter Mike Tauchman on four pitches to open the ninth, then retired the next three for his 22nd save.\n\nThere was much talk that Martinez might be traded before the deadline but the Reds dealt relief pitcher Lucas Sims to the Boston Red Sox instead. So Martinez was still around to get credit for Tuesday's win, pushing his record to 5-5.\n\nSteele, 16-5 last season and a top five finisher in the Cy Young voting, looked as if he realized that GABP is his personal haunted house.\n\nHe started his game by walking Jonathan India and Stephenson singled with two outs. Jeimer Candelario walked on a full count to load the bases and Friedl drove a two-run single up the middle.\n\nNoelvi Marte drew a leadoff walk to start the second and stole second. Espinal then cracked his two-run home run. India, 1 for his last 18, doubled.\n\nAfter De La Cruz and Steer both struck out, Stephenson singled home India for the 5-0 lead.\n\nSteele stayed in and pitched three scoreless innings, but left

TJ Friedl singled in two runs off Justin Steele in the first inning. That's not awful, but the second inning was worse. After a leadoff walk, Santiago Espinal homered to make it 4-0.\n\nSantiago Espinal. There's a reason you don't hear that name much around baseball, he came into the game with a .595 OPS. He's been a journeyman infielder for the Blue Jays and Reds for the last five seasons.\n\nBeyond the homer, Espinal had a four-hit game Tuesday, the first of his career. That gives him the following splits this year:\n\nAgainst Cubs: .444/.444/.778 (8-for-18), two home runs, five RBI\n\nAgainst everyone else: .218/.260/.316 (42-for-193), four home runs\n\nGood thing the Cubs don't play the Reds again after this week until the last three games of the season. Maybe he'll have it out of his system by then.\n\nThe Reds scored one more run off Justin Steele in that second inning. Steele completed five innings and didn't give up any more and struck out seven. But of the four walks Steele issued, two of them led off innings and both of them scored. You just can't do that and expect to succeed.\n\nThe Cubs might have had a run in the top of the second, but Dansby Swanson missed a homer by maybe a few inches [VIDEO].\n\nIt was reviewed but ruled \"call confirmed.\" You can see the ball bounce off the very top of the wall. Another few inches and it's a homer. This is just the way the Cubs season has gone. Swanson was stranded.\n\nThe Cubs did attempt a comeback in this game. In the top of the sixth, Seiya Suzuki led off with a single.\n\nCody Bellinger followed with his 10th home run of the year [VIDEO].\n\nThat was Bellinger's first home run since June 12 against the Rays in St. Petersburg. Yes, Bellinger has missed some time with an injury since then but that's still 109 plate appearances between home runs for him.\n\nIn the seventh, Ian Happ walked with one out and one out later, Seiya Suzuki walked. Bellinger followed that with a single too shallow to score Happ, so the bases were loaded.\n\nA wild pitch by Fernando Cruz scored Happ to make it 5-3 and put runners on second and third. That put the tying runs in scoring position for new Cub Isaac Paredes. A base hit could have tied the game!\n\nParedes hit a line drive toward left, but Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz caught it to end the inning. Paredes went 0-for-4 in his Cubs debut and I might as well mention it or someone else will, Christopher Morel homered in his Rays debut Tuesday evening.\n\nEthan Roberts, recalled to replace the traded Mark Leiter Jr. on the active roster, allowed one run in two innings of work, so it was now a three-run deficit entering the ninth inning. Mike Tauchman led off the ninth with a walk and took second on defensive indifference, but was stranded there to end the game.\n\nThe Cubs now stand 2-7 against the Reds and 13-25 against NL Central teams in 2024, with 14 games remaining within the division. I've been an advocate for more divisional play, but yikes, not this year. That 13-25 record means the Cubs are 38-33 against teams NOT in the NL Central. Now go make sense of that. I sure can't.\n\nThe Cubs thus lost the two games in this series where they appeared to have the pitching matchup advantage. Watch, they'll win tonight, where the Kyle Hendricks vs. Nick Lodolo pitching matchup appears to be to their disadvantage. It's just been that kind of season. And if they do win the series finale, they'll wind up with a winning month of July, as they are currently 12-12 this month. Game time is again 6:10 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network (and MLB Network outside the Cubs and Reds market territories).", "source": {"uri": "bleedcubbieblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleed Cubbie Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "al_yellon@bleedcubbieblue.com", "name": "Al Yellon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Steele", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Espinal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Espinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seiya_Suzuki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seiya Suzuki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dansby_Swanson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dansby Swanson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._A._Happ", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It was also his first game with three extra-base hits.\n\nNick Martinez (5-5) allowed four hits over four shutout innings in relief of opener Tony Santillan to earn the win.

With Cincinnati up 4-0, Stephenson singled home Jonathan India for a five-run lead.\n\nEspinal added a leadoff double in the fourth and a single in the sixth but could not get a triple for the cycle, settling for his second double of the game in the eighth.\n\nAfter being activated from the 10-day injured list on Monday, Cody Bellinger got Chicago on the board in the sixth with a two-run homer off right-hander Lyon Richardson.\n\nDown 5-2, the Cubs mounted a threat with two outs in the seventh when they loaded the bases against relievers Justin Wilson and Fernando Cruz. Ian Happ scored on a wild pitch to make it 5-3, but the inning and rally ended when Isaac Paredes lined out softly to Elly De La Cruz at short.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bradenton.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bradenton Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bradenton.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago_Espinal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Santiago Espinal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Santillan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tony Santillan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ_Friedl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TJ Friedl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Steele", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Stephenson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Stephenson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Paredes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Isaac Paredes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_India", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Bellinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Bellinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Happ", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Happ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Wilson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Wilson (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/prizmh/picture290596454/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/fe1c3082-dcfc-4da0-b729-b41502019949", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777649", "eventUri": "eng-9777649", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Our Cubs vs. Reds predictions and MLB picks are calling for the mediocre results to continue for the southpaw Tuesday.\n\nMy analysis\n\nChicago Cubs starter Justin Steele was cruising along a nine-game heater leading into the All-Star break with a 1.48 ERA and 0.85 WHIP. He held opposing hitters to an unsustainably low .233 BABIP and his 3.44 xFIP was considerably higher than the highlighted ERA.\n\nAs noted, things haven't gone as smoothly out of the break, with the Chicago southpaw sporting a 6.30 ERA, WHIP, and 4.60 xFIP across his past two starts. Opposing hitters have also been incredibly fortunate with an unsustainably high .455 BABIP.\n\nI'm anticipating Steele to settle in the middle Tuesday, with the Cincinnati Reds also eyeing some statistical correction to their 23rd-ranked .284 BABIP against left-handed pitchers this season. Additionally, Great American Ball Park is hitter-friendly, and the Reds have a .312 wOBA at home compared to a .297 mark on the highway.\n\nIt's also notable that Cincy has the luxury of trotting out an entire lineup of righty bats to give them the handedness advantage against Steele. Right-handed bats have far more success against the lefty with a .281 wOBA, while left-handed hitters sport a far lower .201 mark.\n\nI also value the market moving to this Under, and this being a five-star recommendation from our MLB prop projections. The prop-projection insights highlight umpire James Hoye's grading as hitter-friendly and the weather forecast being favorable for offense.\n\nCubs vs Reds same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nThe Reds haven't officially announced a starting pitcher for tonight after trading projected starter Frankie Montas to the Brewers on Monday, and even with Steele's recent hiccups, he's still sporting high-end numbers with a seventh-ranked 3.07 ERA and 13th-ranked 3.47 xFIP among the 91 pitchers with 200+ innings over the past two years.\n\nI expect both offenses to have success with the discussed favorable hitting setup, and the market has been moving to the Over 9 across the board. I expect Steele to have a sound outing, just not a long one in the heat and on the road Tuesday night.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Steele", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Steele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_on_balls_in_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average on balls in play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WOBA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WOBA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Montas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frankie Montas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Metals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Materials/Metals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Whips", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/4e3b1265-b571-42de-a7b5-f4e70a527f6a.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777649", "eventUri": "eng-9777649", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Find out how to watch Cubs-Reds.\n\nThe Cincinnati Reds did not make any big moves at the MLB trade deadline. Some fans might be unhappy, but frankly, the unhappiness should be more with the fact that the Reds are under .500 and not really in a good position to make a run at a playoff spot. It was supposed to be better than this. It's true that injuries have hit the Reds, but Cincinnati has played a lot of sloppy, below-average baseball this season. Winnable games have slipped away due to preventable mistakes on a number of occasions. The players the Reds put on the field just haven't been good enough. This is not a team which was -- or is -- one piece away from figuring it all out. Elly De La Cruz is must-see television for fans at home, and he is a constant thrill for anyone who goes to the ballpark to watch a game in person, but one man can't do it all. Elly needs help, and it's more than just one player. The Reds need to overhaul their roster, and that's an offseason project. An overpay for a short-term rental is something a true contender does. The Reds would be wishing and hoping if they did that, and it would reduce their leverage heading into the offseason. They were right to stand pat at the trade deadline. They have a bigger job ahead, and they were smart to not give up assets with a short-term thought process which would have been completely inappropriate for their situation.\n\nKyle Hendricks (2-9) has a 6.95 ERA. Want to know what the 2024 season has been like for the Cubs? Consider Kyle Hendricks. He was just plain bad for most of the first two months of the season. Then he began to figure things out and play well for a period of time, offering the brief hope that the Cubs could still make something of their season. However, the good times just haven't been good -- or long -- enough. Moreover, on many occasions when a Chicago starting pitcher does well, the offense doesn't do well, and it leaves this team stuck in no-man's land. Hendricks pitched four shutout innings to start last Friday's game against Kansas City. However, his offense got shut out in the first five innings. Hendricks had zero margin for error, and he completely fell off the ledge in a bloody six-run fifth inning. He could have given up only two runs, however, instead of six, and it wouldn't have mattered. The Cubs didn't score a single run in the game. That's the 2024 Cubs for you. Not much has worked at all, even when things go well for a short period of time.\n\nLast Start: Friday, July 26 versus the Kansas City Royals: 5 IP, 8 H, 6 R, 1 HR, 0 BB, 4 K\n\n2024 Road Splits: 8 starts, 45 2/3 IP, 53 H, 38 R, 11 HR, 13 BB, 27 K\n\nNick Lodolo (8-3) has a 3.45 ERA. The Reds have a really good pitcher here. He doesn't get national headlines, but Lodolo takes the ball and usually gives Cincinnati a strong start. Last Friday against the Rays on the road was a textbook example. Going nearly seven full innings and allowing two runs with only one walk is superb pitching. Any starter in today's MLB world will take that as a baseline for consistent success. Lodolo is a source of real hope for the future in Cincy.\n\nLast Start: Friday, July 26 versus the Tampa Bay Rays: 6 2/3 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 0 HR, 1 BB, 5 K\n\nTV: Marquee Sports (Cubs) / Bally Sports Ohio (Reds) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe Cubs have played two bad baseball games in Cincinnati, so the thought process is simple: They're due for a good game.\n\nWhy The Reds Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nLodolo is clearly a better pitcher than Hendricks, and it's not even close. The Reds have the pitching edge by a lot.\n\nFinal Cubs-Reds Prediction & Pick\n\nLodolo outpitches Hendricks. It's that simple.

Hendricks has never been overpowering and succeeded in the past with precision and a smoke-and-mirrors pitch mix that kept hitters off balance.\n\nUnfortunately, the smoke has cleared, and the mirrors are broken.\n\nTurning to Cincinnati Reds starter Nick Lodolo, he's having a much better season and is a promising young arm with three plus pitches. Lodolo just hasn't been as sharp at hitter-friendly Great American Ball Park with a 4.05 ERA, 1.39 WHIP, and 4.50 xFIP this season and respective 4.19, 1.46, and 3.84 marks for his career. Additionally, opposing hitters have squared him up for a healthy .361 wOBA over 135 1/3 career innings at home and a .343 mark this year.\n\nFinally, both the Cubs and Reds are eyeing offensive statistical correction. Chicago has only scored 2.6 runs per game with a 29th-ranked .258 wOBA and 30th-ranked .241 BABIP since the All-Star break, and Cincy hasn't been much better. The Reds have scored 4.1 runs per game with a 26th-ranked .290 wOBA and 20th-ranked .272 BABIP\n\nCubs vs Reds same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nCincinnati has a huge advantage on the mound and even with Lodolo's highlighted ho-hum home metrics, Hendricks is serving up batting practice numbers. Chicago has also been strikeout-prone against righties with its 23.8 K% rate ranking 10th highest, and Lodolo has fanned 13 over his two starts out of the All-Star break.\n\nI also recommend this same-game parlay through bet365 because it's priced at just +307 through FanDuel. The difference checks out as a positive expected value of 11%.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nCubs vs Reds trend\n\nKyle Hendricks has allowed nine runs on 11 hits and three walks through 10 innings over his two starts out of the All-Star break.

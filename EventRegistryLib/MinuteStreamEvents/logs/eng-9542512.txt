The carrier has also announced the further expansion of its network in Europe with the launch of flights to Basel, Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius. With the start of its seasonal summer operations between June and October, the carrier's network spans more than 125 destinations in 58 countries.\n\nGhaith Al Ghaith, Chief Executive Officer at flydubai, said: \"flydubai continues to consistently grow its network and I am pleased to see our operations grow further in South-East Asia with the addition of Malaysia as well as the ongoing expansion in the African and European markets in particular. The added capacity has seen more passengers travel with us since the beginning of this year even though this growth has been dampened by the ongoing delays in aircraft deliveries. We are still on track for one of the busiest summers on record with the start of the seasonal summer schedule from June. Our focus for the coming few months is the ambitious retrofit project across the fleet which will ensure an elevated and more consistent onboard experience for our customers.\"\n\nInvestment in product development\n\nTwo new aircraft joined the flydubai fleet since the start of 2024, growing its fleet to 86 Boeing 737 aircraft serving its expanding network with six more aircraft expected to be delivered by the end of the year amid ongoing challenges in supply chain and delays in its aircraft delivery schedule.\n\nflydubai's fleet consists of 29 Next-Generation Boeing 737-800, 54 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 03 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft. The carrier has launched a retrofit project that will see a complete upgrade of the cabin interior for the majority of its Next-Generation Boeing fleet.\n\nThe multi-million dollar retrofit project was launched in January 2024 and eight aircraft have had a full cabin refresh with the installation of the carrier's flagship lie-flat Business Class seats and the new economy seats from RECARO that mirror the cabin product on its newer aircraft in the fleet. All the retrofitted aircraft will be equipped with Inflight Entertainment and will ensure a more cohesive and consistent travel experience for passengers across the fleet. The airline will retain an all-economy configuration on some of its aircraft and will upgrade the seats to the new RECARO economy seats with Inflight Entertainment.\n\nAs part of its investment in enhancing its onboard experience, the airline will also increase the seat pitch on its recliner Business Class seat product on some of its newer aircraft from 45 to 53 inches. This project will be rolled out after the summer and is predominantly designed to offer a more comfortable travel experience on shorter to medium-haul flights around the region.\n\nThe target is to complete the retrofit programme before the end of the year and the ambitious project is being carried out by both flydubai's inhouse maintenance team and GMR Aerotech MRO.\n\nStrong performance and growing network\n\nflydubai carries almost five million passengers between 01 January and 28 April 2024; a 13% increase compared to the same period last year. The growth was supported by additional capacity across its network.\n\nflydubai has built an expanding network of more than 125 destinations in 58 countries, more than 90 of these routes did not have direct air links to Dubai or were not served by a UAE national carrier from Dubai.\n\nflydubai continues to add capacity across its markets with the frequency across its GCC market back to pre-pandemic levels.\n\n* Colombo frequency increased to 28 flights per week this year compared to 21 per week last year\n\n* Doha frequency increased to 42 flights per week compared to 21 per week last year\n\n* Krakow frequency increased to 10 flights per week from a daily service last year\n\n* Milan service has increased from a five-weekly service to a daily service and will see this frequency double during the peak summer period\n\n* Salalah frequency will increase to 14 flights per week compared to a daily service for the peak summer period\n\n* Beirut frequency will increase to

The airline also added two new aircraft in 2024, growing its fleet to 86 Boeing 737 aircraft.\n\nSix more aircraft are expected to be delivered by the end of the year, amid the ongoing challenges in the supply chain causing delays in its aircraft delivery schedule.\n\nIn a statement on Monday at the Arabian Travel Market, the airline revealed that the multi-million dollar retrofit project was launched in January this year, with eight aircraft having had a full cabin makeover.\n\nThe carrier's cabins now sport a fresh look due to the installation of lie-flat Business Class seats, as well as the new Economy seats from Recaro that mirror the cabin product on its newer aircraft in the fleet.\n\nAll the retrofitted aircraft will be equipped with in-flight entertainment, ensuring a more cohesive and consistent travel experience for passengers.\n\nThe airline will retain an all-economy configuration on some of its aircraft, upgrading the seats to the new Recaro Economy seats that feature in-flight entertainment.\n\nThe airline will also increase the seat pitch on its recliner Business Class seat product on some of its newer aircraft from 45 to 53 inches. This project will be rolled out after the summer for a more comfortable travel experience on shorter to medium-haul flights.\n\nFlydubai reported carrying nearly five million passengers this year until April 28, a 13 per cent increase over the same period last year, thanks to its increased network capacity.\n\nIt has a network of more than 125 destinations in 58 countries, more than 90 of these routes did not have direct air links to Dubai or were not served by a UAE national carrier from Dubai.\n\nIts Colombo frequency was increased to 28 flights per week this year as compared to 21 per week last year. Similarly, Doha frequency was increased to 42 flights per week, compared to 21 per week last year; Krakow increased from a daily to 10 flights per week; Milan service has increased from a five-weekly service to a daily service and will see this frequency double during the peak summer period.\n\nThe airline's operations grew further in Southeast Asia with the addition of Malaysia, and the ongoing expansion in the African and European markets in particular, said Ghaith Al Ghaith, CEO of Flydubai.\n\n\"The added capacity has seen more passengers travel with us since the beginning of this year even though this growth has been dampened by the ongoing delays in aircraft deliveries,\" he said.\n\nWe are still on track for one of the busiest summers on record with the start of the seasonal summer schedule from June.

Taking a walk along the famous Albert Street of the city or in Riga's Old Town, is recommended.\n\nSituated on the bay of north Estonia, Tallinn is a metropolis that has become the birthplace of many international high-technology and start-up companies. The capital also has a rich history and is abundant in nature.\n\nTourists who enjoy culture and architecture should opt for capital of Lithuania, Vilnius, known for its art and culture, urban neighbourhoods and magnificent Baroque architecture.\n\nPassengers travelling with flydubai can enjoy lie-flat seats, internationally-inspired menus and hours of entertainment in Business Class and seats designed to optimise space and comfort in Economy Class.\n\nThe carrier has built a network of 129 destinations in 58 countries and is served by a young and efficient fleet of 86 Boeing 737 aircraft. Since the start of 2024, flydubai has welcomed the start of flights to Mombasa in Kenya, Langkawi and Penang in Malaysia as well as Al Jouf and The Red Sea in Saudi Arabia.\n\nOver the summer,

The diverse panel provided a broad perspective on the challenges and opportunities facing today's hospitality industry.\n\nHaitham Mattar, Managing Director, Middle East, Africa and South West Asia, IHG Hotels & Resorts, initiated the hospitality trends session with an insightful discussion on the dynamic transformation within the hospitality landscape.\n\nAddressing a packed venue of trade professionals, Mattar highlighted the importance of how destinations and hotels identify their respective source markets. \"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way generations choose travel, with outdoor adventure now taking the No. 1 spot away from \"beach, sun and sand\". For the industry to stay afloat in difficult times, the private sector needs to mirror the vision of their respective tourism authorities and work together to ensure appealing spending packages for those markets.\"\n\nHe also outlined how generational shifts and emerging travel behaviours are giving rise to global travel trends such as slow travel and similarly, with the hospitality industry responsible for 10% of global emissions, consumers are now willing to spend up to 31 percent more on hospitality companies that execute sustainable practices.\n\nFurthermore, he highlighted how innovation in the hospitality industry is triggering the pace of digitalisation. \"The future use of technology and AI will be critical for us to get a clear idea of how to enhance consumer preferences. Specifically, travel anxiety is starting to reduce with technology, and the focus should now be firmly on the traveller's experiences,\" he added.\n\nAlso speaking about the transforming needs of the market, Sandeep Walia, Chief Operating Officer, Middle East - Marriott International, echoed Mattar's sentiments as he highlighted slow holidays, sustainability, the rise of AI and dupe destinations - similar to traditional holiday destinations but closer in geography - as some of the key travel trends for the next three years, according to the \"Marriott Bonvoy Travel Trends report 2024 and beyond'.\n\n\"The insights shared today go beyond theories to offer direct reflections of the transformations we aim to foster through ATM. As we continue to drive innovation and entrepreneurial spirit within the travel industry, sessions like these equip our attendees with the knowledge and tools necessary to lead the hospitality industry forward,\" said Danielle Curtis, Exhibition Director ME, Arabian Travel Market.\n\nThe 31st edition of ATM, under the theme \"Empowering Innovation: Transforming Travel Through Entrepreneurship\", also hosted the fascinating Global Stage Welcome: The Gateway to Global Insights session, outlining Dubai's key tourism objectives for the coming years.\n\nElsewhere today, the Market Insights Summit also took centre stage, exploring the potential of developing markets such as China, India and Latin America as they emerge as key players in global tourism.\n\nflydubai\n\nflydubai recorded sustained growth in passenger numbers since the beginning of the year, carrying almost five million passengers between 1st January and 28th April 2024; a 13% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nSince the start of 2024, flydubai has further expanded its network with the start of operations to Al Jouf, Langkawi, Mombasa, Penang and The Red Sea.\n\nThe carrier has also announced the further expansion of its network in Europe with the launch of flights to Basel, Riga, Tallinn and Vilnius.\n\nWith the start of its seasonal summer operations between June and October, the carrier's network spans more than 125 destinations in 58 countries.\n\nGhaith Al Ghaith, Chief Executive Officer at flydubai, said, \"flydubai continues to consistently grow its network and I am pleased to see our operations grow further in South-East Asia with the addition of Malaysia as well as the ongoing expansion in the African and European markets in particular. The added capacity has seen more passengers travel with us since the beginning of this year even though this growth has been dampened by the ongoing delays in aircraft deliveries.\n\nWe are still on track for one of the busiest summers on record with the start of the seasonal summer schedule from June. Our focus for the coming few months is the ambitious retrofit project across the fleet which will ensure an elevated and more consistent onboard experience for our customers.\"\n\nTwo new aircraft joined the flydubai fleet since the start of 2024, growing its fleet to 86 Boeing 737 aircraft serving its expanding network with six more aircraft expected to be delivered by the end of the year amid ongoing challenges in supply chain and delays in its aircraft delivery schedule.\n\nflydubai's fleet consists of 29 Next-Generation Boeing 737-800, 54 Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 03 Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft. The carrier has launched a retrofit project that will see a complete upgrade of the cabin interior for the majority of its Next-Generation Boeing fleet.\n\nThe multi-million dollar retrofit project was launched in January 2024 and eight aircraft have had a full cabin refresh with the installation of the carrier's flagship lie-flat Business Class seats and the new economy seats from RECARO that mirror the cabin product on its newer aircraft in the fleet.\n\nEtihad Airways\n\nEtihad Airways, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, is showcasing its successful growth story, ambitious plans, and investment in guest experience at the Arabian Travel Market, which opens today.\n\nThe UAE's national airline expects to welcome thousands of visitors to its stand including distinguished guests, travel trade customers, members of the media and tourism partners.\n\nJavier Alija, Vice President Sales and Distribution, Etihad Airways, said: \"We're looking forward to a great week ahead at the Arabian Travel Market, where we have the opportunity to showcase the growth story at Etihad Airways, in partnership with Zayed International Airport, our new home in Abu Dhabi. We look forward to welcoming our trade and tourism partners and industry peers to our stand and look forward to a fruitful week for the important travel trade industry.\"\n\nThe stand is presented in partnership with Zayed International Airport, showcasing the stunning new home of Etihad Airways. The new airport, which opened in November 2023, offers streamlined check-in including dedicated spaces for families, First and Business class, as well as biometric self-check in and security facilities.

Eventually, the entirety of its operations will transition to the proposed passenger terminal at DWC by the end of the decade, confirmed Al Ghaith.\n\n\"flydubai has always operated from both airports [DXB and the existing DWC terminal],\" he said. The carrier operated flights from DWC during the pandemic when flight capacities were restricted and during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar in 2022.\n\n\"We reassembled all of our flights (operations) to DXB. However, for continued growth, we need to move to DWC. So, we will start operating from DWC in the 'next couple of years' We will have two operations: one in DWC and one in DXB,\" said Al Ghaith.\n\nAl Ghaith said the new terminal will give the airline a much bigger scope for growth. The airline placed a $11 billion order for 30 Boeing 878 Dreamliners during the Dubai Airshow last year, and Al Ghaith said the move to the proposed terminal is imperative for airline growth.\n\nThe CEO said flydubai is \"working on deployment plans\" for the Dreamliners; however, he said it is \"too early\" to finalise plans for the widebodies. \"The aircraft is expected to come to us in 2026. It is still too early to finalise (deployment plans) until we have clarity on delivery timelines,\" he said. However, a majority of the aircraft will be used to \"go further\", implying long-haul destinations.\n\nDelays in deliveries\n\nThe airline CEO also expressed his concerns about the continued aircraft delivery delays by American plane maker Boeing. flydubai, an all-Boeing operator, has an order backlog of more than 130 737 MAXs to be delivered by 2035, according to an airline report from November 2023. Al Ghaith said the flydubai team has made several trips to inspect the company's production plants and its suppliers to ensure manufacturing standards are \"consistently at a high level\".\n\n\"We have an ongoing discussion with them and have a strong relationship with them. We are very concerned about the delays and the negative issues about them (being) discussed in the media. But we work closely with Boeing, and they work very hard to regain the trust of the customers, and we are one of them,\" he added.\n\n\"Our teams interact with Boeing from the highest level to the lowest level,\" said Al Ghaith.\n\nHe also commended Boeing's decision to buy Spirit Aerosystems - its fuselage supplier and former subsidiary. Boeing has been in talks to acquire the company to address quality control issues on the 737 MAX narrow-body jets.\n\n\"This particular action shows they care (for the stakeholders) and are not looking at the profits and margin. It is a bold and good commitment from Boeing to show they are very serious about this. We value that,\" Al Ghaith said. The airline expects six more aircraft to be delivered by 2024 end. In the meantime, the airline, like Emirates, has undertaken a \"multi-million dollar\" cabin retrofit project to meet growing demand.\n\nGrowth plans\n\nOn Wednesday, the airline announced plans to expand its operations in Europe with the launch of flights to four new destinations: Basel (Switzerland), Riga (Latvia), Tallinn (Estonia), and Vilnius. (Lithuania). \"With the addition of these routes, flydubai becomes the first national carrier to operate direct flights from Dubai,\" the airline said. The airline has also doubled the size of its employees since the pandemic. \"Our attrition rate last year was at 4 per cent, the lowest it has ever been in the history of flydubai,\" he added.\n\nAl Ghaith also believes that travel demand will remain sustainable at current levels for the foreseeable future.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GULF NEWS"}, "authors":

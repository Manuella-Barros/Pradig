Two black bear cubs are back in their natural habitat after they spent 10 months at the San Diego Humane Society\u2019s Ramona Wildlife Center, according to a press release from the organization obtained by PEOPLE. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) began tracking the cubs, who are brothers, in July 2023 after their mother was found dead. Given that they wouldn't be able to survive on their own without their parent, the CDFW rescued the first bear on July 4, 2023, and the second cub, on July 7, 2023. The CDFW released the animals into the San Bernardino National Forest, near where they were first found, on May 15, 2024. The bears had been given a clean bill of health from the Humane Society\u2019s wildlife veterinary team and were microchipped and fitted with GPS collars.

During their time at the San Diego Humane Society, wildlife rehab specialists watched over the cubs with \"minimal contact\" in an effort to make sure that they \"would not become habituated to humans,\" the organization said. The young bears were kept in an outdoor enclosure that mimicked their natural environment, according to the Humane Society. Their living quarters included native plants and substrates such as California live oak, pine, clover, mulberry branches, fruit tree branches, mulch, hummingbird sage, sumac, chamomile flowers and herbs. They were also given food such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, peanut butter and bear chow daily during their stay. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate skill to raise wild bears in captivity,\u201d said Andy Blue, campus director of San Diego Humane Society\u2019s Ramona Wildlife Center. \u201cBears eat more than 10 pounds of food per day, so to ensure they are fed without our staff ever being seen, and that they have plenty of enrichment to exhibit their natural behaviors without leaving human scents behind, takes meticulous planning.\u201d", "summary": "The animals, who were rescued in July 2023 following their mother&#39;s death, were returned to the wild in May 2024", "url": "https://people.com/orphaned-black-bear-cub-siblings-return-to-wild-in-california-8652878", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/B7FU6rIziVsY1hrJmvic2fSNSDE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/black-bear-cubs-return-tout-052324-4d856aaf15764b848dae103c1e3c4a18.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 12:00:00", "author": "Nicholas Rice", "authors": ["Nicholas Rice"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.199}

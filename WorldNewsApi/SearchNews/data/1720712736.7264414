Tesco has issued a recall for its Nutty Nougat Caramel Chocolate Bars and Dreamy Caramel Chocolate Bars multipacks owing to some of these products failing to list peanuts as an allergen. This means the items may pose a risk to anyone with an allergy to peanuts. The best before date on the products considered to pose a \u2018health risk\u2019 is February 28, 2025. A notice on food.gov.uk said: \u2018If you have bought the above products do not eat them. \u2018Instead, return them to any Tesco store for a full refund. \u2018For more information contact Tesco Customer Services on 0800 505 555.\u2019 The supermarket\u2019s Dreamy Caramel Chocolate Bars Multipacks are believed to have been \u2018mispacked\u2019 A warning was also issued Nutty Nougat Caramel Chocolate Bars Multipacks Signs of a potential allergic reaction to peanuts include swelling, particularly of the mouth or throat, fast breathing, blue skin, dizziness, fainting and non-responsiveness. It\u2019s not the only time so far this year that supermarkets have had to issue recall notices for faulty or otherwise dangerous items. Earlier this year, customers at Waitrose were asked to return the supermarket\u2019s own-brand Pitted Spanish Queen Olives amid fears small bits of glass may have found their way into some samples. It followed after Waitrose and Sainsbury\u2019s had warned in March that certain containers of Pataks Aubergine Pickle may have carried exactly the same risk. Meanwhile, Asda and Morrisons had also recalled some of their own-brand cheese after the alarm was raised that some samples may have contained listeria, a bacteria that can cause meningitis. This itself followed after thousands of other items were recalled by Lidl, Asda, Tesco and B&M over exactly the same fears that prompted the most recent warnings: unlisted peanuts.

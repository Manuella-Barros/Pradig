If delivered as promised, Hyundai's upcoming fuel cell vehicle will travel 40 percent farther than its first generation fuel cell SUV, the Tucson ix FCEV, launched in 2013.\n\nFuel cell cars, emission-free like pure electric cars, can be refueled in two to three minutes unlike electric vehicles that can take several hours to fully recharge. But the dearth of hydrogen fueling stations is an obstacle for mass adoption. Toyota, Honda and General Motors are also investing heavily in fuel cell technology but fuel cell cars are gaining less traction than electric vehicles, which can find charging stations more easily.\n\nSouth Korea plans to increase the number of hydrogen fueling stations from 16 stations this year to 100 stations by 2020 to sharply raise sales of fuel cell vehicles. The country is aiming to have 10,000 fuel cell vehicles on its roads by 2020 as part of its plans to tackle air pollution, its environmental ministry said in March. That would be a jump from just 121 fuel cell cars in 2016.\n\nHyundai Motor also plans to catch up in the eco-friendly car race with longer driving range electric vehicles.\n\nIt plans to launch an electric vehicle with a driving range of 311 miles after 2021. Before the summer of next year, it plans to release a small electric sports utility vehicle with a driving range of 242 miles per charge. In 2021, its luxury brand Genesis will unveil an electric vehicle model as well.\n\nOne reason that makes drivers reluctant to buy electric vehicles is a fear that they may not find a charging station in the middle of a trip. Hyundai's first pure electric car IONIQ launched last year had a driving range of 118 miles per charge, shorter than the electric vehicles made by Tesla and General Motors.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 100, "id": 170, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 657, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Automobiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "303971", "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304300", "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "307753", "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309782", "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "311793", "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "335727", "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "380894", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "418661", "label": {"eng": "Driving range"}}]}

a contrast to its 2014 announcement for 22 models, of which only two were slated to be battery-powered.\n\nHyundai also confirmed a Reuters report that it is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges.\n\nLast year, it launched its first mass-market pure electric car IONIQ, but the vehicle's per-charge driving range is much shorter than offerings from Tesla and General Motors.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 100, "id": 170, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "wgt": 100, "id": 1377, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302575", "label": {"eng": "Kia Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302722", "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "303971", "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304070", "label": {"eng": "News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304300", "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305061", "label": {"eng": "Battery (electricity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307166", "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309694", "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "371405", "label": {"eng": "Media event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "437300", "label": {"eng": "Guk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "454231", "label": {"eng": "Green vehicle"}}]}

But it has mainly provided the vehicle to public organizations due to high prices and lack of the charging infrastructure.\n\n\"We are now putting a bigger focus on developing the 'ultimate' environment-friendly vehicles, such as all-electric and fuel-cell electric cars,\" Hyundai Motor Senior Vice President Lee Ki-sang said in a press conference held to unveil the next-generation vehicle.\n\nTo boost the sale of fuel-cell electric models, Hyundai Motor will closely cooperate with the government to increase the number of chargers and promote public awareness about eco-friendly cars, Executive Vice President Lee Kwang-guk said.\n\nThis photo provided by Hyundai Motor shows its fuel-cell electric SUV. (Yonhap)\n\nHyundai Motor also plans to introduce an all-electric Genesis sedan in 2021, the company said in a statement. It sells Genesis sedans as an independent brand as Toyota Motor Corp. does with its Lexus models.\n\nThe electric Genesis will be the high-performance, long-range electric car to be sought by Hyundai Motor, the executives said.\n\nThe move comes as Hyundai Motor struggles with a lack of new models, particularly SUVs, and declining sales in major markets, such as China and the United States.\n\n\"Hyundai aims to take the lead in the eco-friendly vehicle markets with the launch of the new fuel-cell electric car. With the pure electric Genesis model, it will globally compete with Tesla Motors Inc.'s luxury Model X and Model S in the long term,\" a company spokesman said.\n\nThe new fuel-cell electric SUV can travel more than 580 kilometers on a single charge, he said.\n\nIn extended efforts to strengthen its electric car lineup, the carmaker plans to launch the electric version of the Kona subcompact SUV with a driving range of 390 km in the first half of 2018, it said.\n\nThe electric version of the luxury Genesis sedan will have a range of 500 km on a charge. The range is similar to the driving ranges of 400 km-540 km for Tesla's Model S and X.\n\nAll the planned launches are in line with Hyundai Motor Group's renewed goal of introducing 31 eco-friendly models in global markets by 2020. The world's No. 5 automaker by sales previously targeted to launch 28 eco-friendly cars.\n\nHyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. will jointly develop the 31 vehicles that include 10 hybrid electric models, 11 plug-in hybrids, eight all-electric cars and two fuel-cell electric cars by that year, the statement said.\n\nThe two carmakers have suffered sharp sales declines in China amid diplomatic rows between the two countries over the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system in South Korea.\n\nChina has taken measures against South Korean products and the sale of group travel packages to its neighboring country in an apparent retaliation against the deployment. Beijing has argued the system could spy on its military though Seoul has said it is aimed at countering missile threats from North Korea.\n\nIn the January-June period, Hyundai and Kia sold a combined 430,947 vehicles in China, down 47 percent from 808,359 units a year earlier.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label":

That vehicle, a luxury Genesis sedan, will follow an electric version of the Kona sport utility vehicle that the Korean automaker hopes to release in the first half of next year. The electric Kona should have a range of 243 miles, Reuters noted.\n\nAlong with affiliate company Kia, Hyundai announced eight electric cars and two fuel-cell vehicles coming to market in the near future -- a significant jump in the number of electric vehicles (EVs) that the company has planned to bring to market in years prior. Hyundai, like Toyota, has boosted the fuel cell vehicle for years. Fuel cell vehicles use hydrogen as fuel and emit water as a byproduct. But the compressed hydrogen that runs fuel cell vehicles is hard to store and hard to transport, so it has been slow reaching the market, although fuel cell vehicles do have the advantage of being fast to refuel, unlike electric vehicle batteries.\n\nToyota has also recently shown signs that it's pouring more resources into mass-producing a long-range electric car as well. In July, an article in The Wall Street Journal noted that the Japanese automaker was working on building a battery with a solid electrolyte that would go into production in 2022. With Tesla and Chevrolet rolling out moderately priced EVs with long-range capabilities, other automakers known for moderately priced cars seem to be ready to get in the ring as well.\n\nHyundai also told Reuters that it's developing its first electric vehicle platform -- a step toward quickly building multiple electric models in the future.\n\nThe automaker also showed off a \"near-production\" version of a new fuel cell SUV that can travel 360 miles on a full tank. Still, lack of infrastructure is a major problem for fuel cell vehicles that aren't use-specific (like forklifts in Amazon warehouses). \"Hyundai will achieve economies of scale for fuel cell cars by 2035 at the earliest,\" Lee Hang-koo, a senior research fellow at Korea Institute for Industrial Economics & Trade, told Reuters.\n\nElectric vehicles, on the other hand, are quickly gaining critical infrastructure around the world, although they're hardly well-served.

It sells Genesis sedans as an independent brand as Toyota Motor Corp. does with its Lexus models.\n\nThe move comes as Hyundai Motor struggles with a lack of new models, particularly SUVs, and declining sales in major markets, such as China and the United States.\n\n\"Hyundai aims to take the lead in the eco-friendly vehicle markets with the launch of the fuel-cell electric car. With the pure electric Genesis model, it will globally compete with Tesla Motors Inc.'s luxury Model X and Model S in the long term,\" a company spokesman said over the phone.\n\nThis photo courtesy of Hyundai Motor shows its fuel-cell electric SUV. (Yonhap)\n\nHyundai Motor aims to launch a fuel-cell electric SUV that can travel more than 580 kilometers on a single charge, the company said in a statement.\n\nIn extended efforts to strengthen its electric car lineup, the carmaker plans to launch the electric version of the Kona subcompact SUV with a driving range of 390 km in the first half of 2018, it said.\n\nThe electric version of the luxury Genesis sedan will have a range of 500 km on a charge. The range is similar to the driving ranges of 400 km-540 km for Tesla's Model S and X.\n\nAll the planned launches are in line with Hyundai Motor Group's renewed goal of introducing 31 eco-friendly models in global markets by 2020. The world's No. 5 automaker by sales said last year it will launch 28 eco-friendly cars.\n\nHyundai Motor and its affiliate Kia Motors Corp. will jointly develop the 31 vehicles that include 10 hybrid electric models, 11 plug-in hybrids, eight all-electric cars and two fuel-cell electric cars by that year, the statement said.\n\nThe two carmakers have suffered sharp sales declines in China amid diplomatic rows between the two countries over the deployment of an advanced U.S. missile defense system in South Korea.\n\nChina has taken measures against South Korean products and the sale of group travel packages to its neighboring country in an apparent retaliation against the deployment. Beijing has argued the system could spy on its military though Seoul has said it is aimed at countering missile threats from North Korea.\n\nIn the January-June period, Hyundai and Kia sold a combined 430,947 vehicles in China, down 47 percent from 808,359 units a year earlier.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label":

But the dearth of hydrogen fueling stations is an obstacle for mass adoption.\n\nToyota, Honda and GM are also investing heavily in fuel cell technology but fuel cell cars are gaining less traction than electric vehicles, which can find charging stations more easily.\n\nSouth Korea plans to increase the number of hydrogen fueling stations from 16 stations this year to 100 stations by 2020 to sharply raise sales of fuel cell vehicles. The country is aiming to have 10 000 fuel cell vehicles on its roads by 2020 as part of its plans to tackle air pollution, its environmental ministry said in March. That would be a jump from just 121 fuel cell cars in 2016.\n\nHyundai also plans to catch up in the eco-friendly car race with longer driving range electric vehicles.\n\nSources: AP & Hyundai", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 657, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Automobiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "303971", "label": {"eng": "Toyota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304300", "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honda", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "307753", "label": {"eng": "Honda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309703", "label": {"eng": "Mass production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309782", "label": {"eng": "Air pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "311793", "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charging_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "335727", "label": {"eng": "Charging station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "380894", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jin", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "643675", "label": {"eng": "Lee Jin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areal_density_(computer_storage)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "1334676", "label": {"eng": "Areal density (computer storage)"}}]}

Looks like its hydrogen-dreams aren't going away anytime soon. For all we know, Hyundai is betting big on fuel cell technology. The next fuel cell vehicle is near-production ready and will be revealed in January at the CES 2018.\n\nThe 2018 Hyundai fuel cell SUV draws heavily on the FE Fuel Cell concept first seen at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. Although, the lighting and side-view mirrors are far more realistic. The door handles rest alongside the bodywork to reduce any kind of an aerodynamic drag. The overall design makes it look like anything but an ordinary vehicle.\n\nThe upcoming Hyundai fuel cell vehicle will have 20 percent more power than the ix Fuel Cell car, at 120 kW. There's also good news for those living in extreme climates. The vehicle will start in temperatures below -30\u00b0 C - all thanks to the new fuel cell technology. Tidbit: Recently, two FE prototypes had undergone testing in Australia's Snow Mountains.) For what it's worth, the new fuel cell technology will also help the automaker drastically reduce production costs.\n\nHydrogen will be stored in three tanks with plastic liners which will help squeeze more fuel. The design of the tanks is one major factor contributing to the promised 580-km range. Moreover, the fuel cell will operate at 60 percent efficiency, which is a huge improvement over the existing Tucson vehicle.\n\nHyundai also announced that it will launch a new line of battery-electric cars during the next year. This includes an electric version of the Kona SUV, the Genesis luxury model which will be all-electric, and a third model with a range of 500 km.\n\nThe Seoul-based automaker is also planning to launch a dedicated platform for electric vehicles. This will make things less complicated as the automaker can easily work on futuristic concepts and develop models with better battery technology.\n\nThe pricing of the Hyundai fuel cell SUV is yet to be announced. It will launch next year in South Korea, shortly followed by North America and Europe. The company might even look into breaking into emerging markets such as India and China.\n\nDespite bold ambitions, the realities look nothing less than grave. For starters, we lack proper fueling infrastructure for hydrogen vehicles?

Even Toyota, which has focused on hybrid for today and fuel-cell for tomorrow, is now scrambling to get an EV plan on track. Hyundai, another believer in fuel-cell tech, is also slightly behind the curve in EVs.\n\nSeeking to address investor concerns that it is lagging rivals in the battery-powered green car race, Hyundai said today that it will launch a long-range electric vehicle with a range of 500 km per charge after year 2021, Reuters reports.\n\nHyundai and Kia also have plans to roll out 31 eco-friendly models by 2020, up from a previously intended 28. The new models will include three plug-in hybrid vehicles, which come on top of eight full EVs and two fuel-cell vehicles.\n\nAs previously reported, an EV version of the new Hyundai Kona compact SUV will debut in the first half of 2018, and it will come with a range of 390 km. That's a big improvement from Hyundai's previous and first mass-market battery-powered car - the Ioniq Electric with a range of 169 km, far below the range touted by the likes of GM with the Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla.\n\nThe newswire also said that Hyundai has confirmed its report that the Korean carmaker is developing its first dedicated electric vehicle platform, which will allow the group to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges per charge.\n\nBut all of the company's efforts on hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles has not gone to waste. Hyundai has unveiled a near production version of an FCEV SUV with a zero-emissions range of more than 800 km per charge, nearly double the 415 km of its current Tucson FCEV. The futuristic mid-size SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, followed by the US and Europe. A FCEV sedan is also being planned.

The new fuel cell SUV will spearhead Hyundai Motor's plans to accelerate development of low emission vehicles, in line with Hyundai Motor Group's renewed goal of introducing 31 eco-friendly models (Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors combined) to global markets by 2020.\n\nThe yet-to-be-named model shown previews Hyundai Motor's second commercially produced hydrogen model and uses the company's fourth-generation of hydrogen fuel cell technology. The vehicle, its capabilities and fuel cell technologies are an evolution of Hyundai Motor's global research, development and real-world evaluation programs. The company launched its first commercial fuel cell vehicle in 2013.\n\nThe new fuel cell model was developed on four key pillars that focus on fuel cell system efficiency; performance (maximum output); durability; and tank storage density.\n\nThe mass-produced new vehicle will also feature advanced driver assistance technologies, alongside its extensive hydrogen-powered range. The details of the new ADAS features will be disclosed in January at the 2018 CES, along with the official model name.\n\nHyundai Motor will reveal the new hydrogen SUV early next year in Korea, followed by the North American and European markets. The company will also consider expanding availability of its new fuel cell model to markets with high growth potential for eco-friendly vehicles such as China.\n\nNew eco-vehicle development roadmap. Hyundai Motor plans to take a multi-pronged approach to its eco-vehicle program. The company is committed to a future vehicle line-up comprising a variety of powertrain options -- electric, hybrid and fuel cell -- to suit customers' varied lifestyles.\n\nThe roadmap sets out the brand's goal of leading the global popularization of hybrid vehicles, expanding its lineup to SUVs and large vehicles. Another part of the plan is the development of 4WD and FR (Front Engine Rear Wheel Drive) variants, building on its proprietary Transmission-Mounted Electrical Device (TMED) system, which was developed in 2011. (Earlier post.)\n\nWhile Hyundai Motor continues to develop its leadership of the electric vehicle market with its current IONIQ model, the company also aims to establish a lineup ranging from small EVs to large and luxurious Genesis-brand models. Hyundai Motor's electric vehicle development will take place in multiple phases:\n\nFurthermore, Hyundai Motor will develop its first dedicated architecture for pure electric vehicles, which will allow the company to produce multiple models with longer driving ranges.\n\nHyundai Motor will also strengthen its global leadership in hydrogen fuel cell technology. This will center on enhancing research and development efforts to boost FCEV performance and durability, while also making the technology smaller and cheaper so that it can be applied to smaller sedans. As part of these efforts, Hyundai Motor will unveil a new hydrogen-powered bus in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nHyundai Motor will also take part in the Hydrogen House, projected by the Seoul city government, displaying prototypes of the new fuel cell vehicle starting today until 17 November that will promote emission-free fuel cell vehicles and a Hydrogen Society. It is through initiatives like this that Hyundai Motor will demonstrate how a Hydrogen Energy Society could be realized in the not-too-distant future.\n\nHyundai Motor now sells fuel cell vehicles in 18 countries. The company began researching fuel cell technology in 1998 and developed its first fuel cell vehicle based on the Santa Fe SUV, as part of a collaboration with CaFCP (California Fuel Cell Partnership).", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 100, "id": 170, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1105, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302575", "label": {"eng": "Kia Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309703", "label": {"eng": "Mass production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314837", "label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "362311", "label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "380893", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "450302", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "454231", "label": {"eng": "Green vehicle"}}]}

Known only by its internal \"FE\" name, the hydrogen-powered SUV will be capable of up to 800 kilometers of driving range per hydrogen fill, and will integrate a range of autonomous driving capabilities.\n\nThe yet-to-be-named fuel cell car is set to make its official debut at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January 2018.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the brand, 31 new eco-friendly models are set tol roll-out across the globe by 2020 across both the Hyundai and Kia brands.\n\n\"Hyundai Motor plans to take a multi-pronged approach to its eco-vehicle program,\" the statement says.\n\n\"The company is committed to a future vehicle line-up comprising a variety of powertrain options - electric, hybrid and fuel cell - to suit customers' varied lifestyles.\"\n\nHyundai is preparing to introduce new hybrid variants of four-wheel-drive and rear-wheel-drive vehicles, pointing to new driveline technology for next-generation versions of the Santa Fe and the growing Genesis range.\n\nIt aims to \"establish a lineup ranging from small [electric vehicles] to large and luxurious Genesis-brand models\" rolled out over the next five years.\n\nDespite the official announcement it's still unclear which models are on the horizon for Australia.\n\nHybrid-powered models are certainly nothing new for the brand, with Hyundai selling a range of hybrid-powered models overseas without introducing them to Australia. That's set to change later this year with the introduction of the Prius-rivalling Ioniq hybrid, with the plug-in hybrid version and pure EV Ioniq variants still under evaluation for introduction at a later date.\n\nHyundai spokesman Bill Thomas says it is too early to discuss which all-electric cars will come to Australia, saying only that \"we always evaluate all future models for their feasibility\".", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 587, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 657, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Automobiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity", "wgt": 100, "id": 1377, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Electricity"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "loc", "id": "12"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302575", "label": {"eng": "Kia Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302722", "label": {"eng": "Brand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Prius", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303969", "label": {"eng": "Toyota Prius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305061", "label": {"eng": "Battery (electricity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308032", "label": {"eng": "Four-wheel drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309796", "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_CES", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312203", "label": {"eng": "International CES"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312316", "label": {"eng": "Hybrid (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(botany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314240", "label": {"eng": "Variety (botany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314837", "label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "319415", "label": {"eng": "Book of Genesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319947", "label": {"eng": "Luxury vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319951", "label": {"eng": "Autonomous car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348311", "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}]}

Although Hyundai has yet to name the new model, it promises increased range, performance, and durability over the outgoing ix35 Fuel Cell, known as the Tucson Fuel Cell here in the U.S.\n\nPower will increase 20 percent over the outgoing model, Hyundai says, and system efficiency will jump 9 percent. With the updated fuel cell system, the SUV should achieve a driving range of more than 580 km (360 miles) on a single charge, based on Korean testing standards.\n\nCertain components increase aerodynamic performance on the new model. A tunnel inside the D-pillar in addition to wheels designed in a two-piece construction help boost aero efficiency.\n\nThe new model borrows certain design elements from Hyundai's FE fuel cell concept, which was revealed in March. Not only does it feature the same rounded hood, but the headlights take on a similar shape, and the door handles once again sit flush to the vehicle.\n\nHyundai has also bolstered the longevity of the hydrogen-powered SUV by using highly durable catalyst technology. New components in the fuel stack have improved performance at start-up in cold temperatures. The vehicle has been optimized to start at 22 degrees Fahrenheit. The new SUV also improves tank storage density, now that there are three equally-sized tanks instead of two different sizes.\n\nExpect the new Hyundai fuel cell SUV to offer advanced driver assistance technologies. More details on this front will be shared at the 2018 CES Show, where we'll also learn the official name of the model. The SUV will launch in Korea early next year, and after that, it will arrive in North America and Europe. Hyundai is also considering whether or not to bring the model to China.\n\nThe new fuel cell SUV is just one green model Hyundai plans to introduce globally in the coming years. Hyundai confirmed that it will launch a Kona EV in the first half of 2018. It's unclear which markets will receive the new model, but it should offer a range of 390 km (242 miles) on a single charge, likely based on Korean testing standards. Meanwhile, a Genesis EV will arrive in 2021, and a new EV with a range of 500 km (310 miles) is slated to arrive later.\n\nAs we previously reported, Hyundai plans to launch its first dedicated architecture for all-electric vehicles.

It will be sold in certain markets in Korea, North America, Europe and possibly China.\n\nIt can go about a quarter farther than the previous hydrogen fuel cell model, a version of the Hyundai Tuscon.\n\nThe new vehicle, modeled after the FE Concept revealed at the 2017 Geneva Auto Show, is one of 31 electric, hybrid or fuel cell models Hyundai and sister brand Kia play to introduce globally by 2020.\n\nHyundai is also investing in a new vehicle architecture designed to support long-range electric cars. The company recently introduced a battery-powered vehicle called the Ioniq, but it falls well short of the range of General Motors' Chevrolet Bolt and Tesla's Model 3.\n\nHyundai said it would make a long-range electric car sometime after 2021.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2xaqYdg", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Automobiles", "wgt": 100, "id": 657, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Automobiles"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc", "id": "47"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302575", "label": {"eng": "Kia Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc", "id": "303048"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303165", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304300", "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "305061", "label": {"eng": "Battery (electricity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_efficiency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307578", "label": {"eng": "Fuel efficiency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "362317", "label": {"eng": "Geneva Motor Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "380893", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}]}

Hyundai-Kia is the only competitor that truly scares industry colossus Toyota.\n\nThirty years ago, the Korean company was a bit player, producing designs adapted from obsolete Mitsubishi technology.\n\nToday it's a major global player, reacting fast to market swings -- and its goal is to be second only to Toyota itself in global production of green cars by 2020.\n\nDON'T MISS: Hyundai, Kia Target # 2 Green-Vehicle Slot By 2020 (Nov 2014)\n\nOne more example of Hyundai's adaptation to changing market conditions came today in an announcement Thursday that it would place electric cars at the center of its future product strategy.\n\nAs part of that shift, it will expand its portfolio of battery-electric vehicles to newly independent luxury brand Genesis, which will get a long-range electric car to compete directly with Tesla as well as several future German electric models.\n\nThe new Hyundai electric car will be a luxury sedan to arrive in 2021, according to a Reuters report early Thursday that expanded on the Hyundai release.\n\nThe future Genesis competitor for the Tesla Model S may be the company's first \"long range\" electric vehicle (meaning 200 to 300 miles on a charge), but it won't be the last.\n\nBefore that, an all-electric Hyundai Kona subcompact crossover utility vehicle will launch next year, perhaps with a range of 125 to 200 miles.\n\nThe combined Hyundai and Kia brands have added three further models to their green-car lineup (hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electrics, and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles), for a total of 31 separate vehicle versions by 2020.\n\nCHECK OUT: Hyundai Ioniq hybrid, electric model demand higher than expected, company says\n\nIn 2014, when Hyundai announced its plan to become the world's second-largest maker of green cars by 2020, just two of 22 planned models were to be pure battery-electrics.\n\nNow, fully eight of the expanded roster of 31 cars will be all-electric, with the Hyundai Ioniq Electric and Kia Soul EV already in production jointed by the battery-powered Kona and an all-electric Kia Niro that may replace the Soul EV.\n\nWhile Hyundai also released images of its future hydrogen-powered large crossover vehicle, which will be formally unveiled next year, only two of the planned 31 vehicles will use fuel cells.\n\nThe company also confirmed earlier reports that it would create its first dedicated electric-car platform, a strategy so far only followed by General Motors (with its Bolt EV and future derivatives), Tesla, and arguably Nissan for its Leaf.\n\nSome coverage of Hyundai's announcement has presented it as a strategic shift, but it can be more accurately viewed as an evolution and expansion of the company's green-car plans.\n\nThe Hyundai Ioniq Electric, launched over the last 12 months in several markets around the world, has proven more popular than expected, Hyundai says, leading to short supplies in several countries.\n\nREAD THIS: Hyundai Hybrids, Electric Cars & More: 5 Qs With Green R&D Head Ki-Sang Lee (Jan 2015)\n\nWith 124 miles of EPA-rated range, the electric Ioniq combines a conventional and intuitive interior design

This marks a shift away from, but not an entire abandonment of, hydrogen fuel cell technology. Hyundai already has a Tucson-based fuel cell crossover available for lease in California.\n\nThe first move will be to electrify the Kona subcompact SUV. It'll pack an estimated range of about 240 miles, and it's expected to make its debut in the first half of 2018. Following that, Hyundai will introduce a Genesis EV with a range in excess of 300 miles. Expect that one to arrive in 2021.\n\nHyundai's other sister brand, Kia, isn't sitting idly by. Kia plans to bring three different plug-in hybrids to market, as well as eight battery-electric and two fuel cell vehicles.\n\nThat sounds like a lot of new models, and it is, but it shouldn't break Hyundai's bank. In its plan to expand EV availability, Hyundai will develop a platform dedicated to electric vehicles. With the majority of the complex running bits on a flexible platform, Hyundai and its associated marques can focus on building a whole bunch of bodies under which the batteries will live.\n\nWhile Hyundai might be giving less attention to fuel cells, they're not entirely off the company's radar. Genesis showed off a hydrogen fuel-cell concept SUV earlier this year, and Hyundai unveiled a fuel cell ute of its own just this week.\n\nHyundai's first foray into the dedicated-EV market came with the introduction of the Ioniq. This sedan is available in various electrified forms, whether it's a traditional hybrid, a plug-in hybrid or a battery-electric vehicle. We've driven it, and we like it, but some specs (like EV range) lag behind the competition.\n\n70 Hitting the road in all three 2017 Hyundai Ioniq models Tags Hyundai Kia Electric Cars Fuel Cell Cars Hybrids Future Cars Hyundai", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Power_Supplies", "wgt": 100, "id": 466, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Power Supplies"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "wgt": 100, "id": 641, "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1105, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tucson"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucson"}, "type": "loc", "id": "226597"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc", "id": "227084"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302575", "label": {"eng": "Kia Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "302588", "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302653", "label": {"eng": "Genesis (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305061", "label": {"eng": "Battery (electricity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_(automobile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "307166", "label": {"eng": "Sedan (automobile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312316", "label": {"eng": "Hybrid (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319256", "label": {"eng": "Concept car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "348311", "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357592", "label": {"eng": "Compact sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "369890", "label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "380891", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}]}

While the new electric model, which should come with \"range of 500 km (310 miles) per charge\" is expected in 2021, the automaker will also deliver a battery version of the Kona small sport utility vehicle with a range of 390 km in the first months of 2018.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 587, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 658, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models", "wgt": 100, "id": 1524, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Models"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}, "type": "loc", "id": "121"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303165", "label": {"eng": "Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304300", "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309694", "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_emission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "403703", "label": {"eng": "Zero emission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "454231", "label": {"eng": "Green vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship's_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1278137", "label": {"eng": "Ship's company"}}]}

It also looks to debut the Kona compact crossover, while Genesis will unveil the G70 sports sedan in September.\n\nIn addition, the auto giant announced it will use the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang as a demonstration event for it self-driving technology.\n\nIn a news conference, Executive Vice President Lee Kwang-guk said the company's eco-friendly car strategy would employ technology that is mainstream and realistic.\n\nHyundai unveiled a near production version of its new fuel cell SUV with a driving range of more than 360 miles per charge. The mid-sized SUV will be launched in Korea early next year, with U.S. and European markets following.\n\nThis has big ramifications for Hyundai's international market.

Hyundai claims the FE's fuel-cell has improved cold start capability, while also being more durable than the unit used in the outgoing ix35 Fuel Cell.\n\nTop: Hyundai 'Next Generation FCEV', Bottom: Hyundai FE concept\n\nThe FE's hydrogen fuel will be stored in three equally-sized tanks - as opposed to the current two tanks of different capacities.\n\nHyundai also says the new SUV will feature its advanced driver assistance technologies, which are to be detailed in January at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) along with the production model's official name.\n\nIn terms of its design, it appears the production version of the FE will look very much like the concept car that previewed it (above), though a little more tame. The company describes the overall exterior look as futuristic and \"inspired by nature\".\n\n\"The new model builds on the earlier concept's design, taking an organic and flowing form, inspired by nature - namely water, the car's only emission - with the clean design emphasising its non-polluting nature,\" Hyundai said in its press release.\n\nInside, the design is a little more conventional and quite minimalistic. The driver's instruments are fully digital and the display has merged with the central infotainment screen, much like several models from the Mercedes-Benz portfolio.\n\nThere's also elements of Lexus in terms of the sloping centre console and cylindrical air vent trim - which extend the entire length of the dashboard.\n\nHyundai says the interior colour scheme - shades of cream and brown on the vehicle shown - are also inspired by nature, while there's heavy use of bio-materials with eco-friendly certification, along with woven fabric and suede accents in the seat trims.\n\nAustralia has helped contribute to the new FCEV's development process, too. Last month two left-hand drive prototypes (above) underwent cold-weather testing in the Snowy Mountains as part of a global testing and durability program.\n\nMeanwhile, Hyundai has already announced it will supply a 20-strong fleet of the 'FE' to the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) government in late 2018 for the Hornsdale Wind Farm Stage 3 project.\n\nThe new fuel-cell SUV will form part of the Hyundai Motor Group's goal of introducing 31 eco-friendly models (up from the 14 announced earlier this year) across the Hyundai and Kia brands to global markets by 2020 - which includes electric, hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles.\n\nFollowing the launch of the Ioniq hybrid and EV family, Hyundai will introduce an electric version of the Kona crossover - which will have a range of 390km - in the first half of 2018, while the first EV from luxury arm Genesis will launch in 2021. Finally, the company has confirmed a long-range EV with more than 500km of range will arrive after 2021.\n\nAbove: Hyundai ix35 Fuel Cell\n\nThe production version of the 'Next Generation FCEV' has already been confirmed for the ACT government, though public sale in the foreseeable future is unlikely at this point given the lack of hydrogen refueling infrastructure in Australia.\n\nHowever, Hyundai has already indicated the Ioniq should arrive in local showrooms early in 2018, in all-electric guise along with hybrid and/or plug-in hybrid (PHEV) forms.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kona EV has also been earmarked as a potential offering in Australia, with Bill Thomas, Hyundai's local communications boss, telling CarAdvice: \"We would definitely look at the electric version of Kona.

In addition to being significantly more efficient, Hyundai's yet-unnamed next-gen FCEV promises enhanced performance, greater range and better durability as well as more advanced driver-assistance technologies. In addition to showing the near-production prototype, the automaker confirmed a Hyundai Group effort to introduce 31 new \"eco-friendly\" Hyundai/Kia/Genesis models into various global markets by 2020.\n\nFCEV for the future\n\nBorrowing a number of styling cues from the FE Fuel Cell Concept presented earlier this year in Geneva, Hyundai's newest FCEV matches modern, minimalist character with nature-inspired organic forms to yield an aerodynamic package with solid presence. This well-tailored understatement also is evident in the cabin of this 5-seat hauler which matches highly legible digital displays and driver-centric controls with a selection of eco-friendly materials including fabric and suede seating surfaces.\n\nAlso: Get your first look at the new and redesigned cars of 2018\n\nWhile many details about Hyundai's new super-clean FCEV-including its name and the scope of new driver assists-won't be disclosed will until its U.S. appearance at the 2018 CES Show in January, the automaker has confirmed a number of pertinent facts about the new Gen IV fuel cell system. For openers, it develops 161 horsepower (20 percent more than the current Tucson FCEV) and offers 60 percent operating efficiency, a gain of nine percent. Design advances now allow starting in temps as low as 22 degrees Fahrenheit and new catalyst technology ensures even greater durability.\n\nLower costs\n\nLess costly to produce, Hyundai's new fuel cell package also replaces two different-sized hydrogen storage tanks with three identically scaled units that can hold more gas per tank weight. That change is projected to yield up to 500 miles of range on the wildly optimistic European NEDC-think closer to 350-380 EPA miles-compared to the 265-mile capability of the current Tucson FCEV. \"With exceptional efficiency, serene styling, and uncompromised performance, our next generation fuel cell SUV is the true epitome of an eco-friendly vehicle of the future,\" said Lee Ki-sang, senior vice president of Hyundai Motor Group's Eco Technology Center.\n\nHyundai also provided insight regarding its plans for developing a selection of eco-friendly, low-emission vehicles that rely on a variety of powertrains including electric, hybrid and fuel cell that will best suit the needs of its global customer base. Hyundai promises new hybrid variants, which will include even more SUVs and large vehicles. Hyundai also will focus on creating new front-engine/rear-drive and 4WD models that incorporate its proprietary Transmission-Mounted Electrical Device (TMED) system.\n\nAlso: See the 12 Kelley Blue Book Best Buys of 2017\n\nHyundai announced plans to establish a broad, multidivisional lineup of EVs that will begin with a battery-electric version of the new Kona crossover boasting a 240-mile range that's due during the first half of 2018. An all-electric Genesis is set to hit the market in 2021 and an undisclosed EV with a range of 311 miles will follow at a later date. Hyundai said it will develop its first dedicated EV architecture that will be suitable for a broad range of long-distance models. Finally, the fuel cell program will be accelerated and focus on further trimming cost, improving packaging, boosting performance and enhancing durability with an eye towards being able to make FCEV systems viable in small sedans.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 37, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt":

Based on the FE Concept it brought to Geneva earlier this year, the as yet unnamed new model will go on sale in Korea early in 2018, followed by sales in the US and Europe shortly thereafter.\n\nThe big news is that the fourth-generation fuel cell for the new car is more powerful, more efficient, and has longer range than the unit used in the current Tucson FCEV, known in other markets as the ix35. Efficiency of the fuel cell is now 60% -- up from 55% in the Tucson. Range is up to 800 kilometers or 500 miles, according to a Hyundai press release sent our way. That's using the New European Driving Cycle, so knock that back to about 400 miles by the time an EPA sticker goes on the window.\n\nThe new fuel cell configuration is more powerful as well. It is rated at 161 horsepower -- 20% more than the Tucson FCEV. It also has been tweaked to improve low temperature operation. It now performs well at temperatures as low as -30 degrees Celsius (-22\u00b0F). The system was tested for its cold weather performance prowess in the Snow Mountains in Australia as part of the company's global assessment and durability program.\n\nHyundai is enthusiastic about the styling of the new car, touting its smooth, flowing flanks, which it says evoke the flow of water -- which is the only byproduct emitted by its fuel cell. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, of course, but the Concept that appeared in Geneva is far more attractive than the car the press saw in Seoul.\n\nIn particular, the Concept featured smooth front end styling that resembles the grille-less look pioneered by Tesla. The prototype has an enormous toothy grille that looks like a nuclear-powered cheesegrater. Automakers seem convinced customers want cars that look like they can chew up and spit out any cars that dare get in their way. Maybe that's true. Styling gets intensively test marketed. But the clean Tesla front-end treatment seems more appropriate for a car whose main feature is that is does not have an internal combustion engine.\n\nHyundai is busy filling as many holes in its product lineup as possible. It's conventional cars are world class in terms of styling and owner satisfaction. Its hybrid offerings are world class as well, with the new Ioniq Hybrid being the EPA's MPGe champion. It is pushing forward aggressively with plug-in hybrid technology and has plans for a pure battery-electric chassis in the works.\n\nFuel cells are appealing ... on the surface. What could be more eco-friendly than a power source that creates no waste products other than water vapor and heat? Unfortunately, hydrogen overwhelmingly comes from natural gas, which is not so green. Getting the hydrogen, transporting it, and building hydrogen refueling stations that are frighteningly expensive produces another problem. Also, as this photo reveals, the fuel cell powertrain is bulky. Compared to a battery-electric powertrain, which leaves room for extra storage capacity in the \"frunk,\" an FCEV still needs a full engine compartment and large storage tanks.\n\nIn the contest between hydrogen-powered cars and electric cars, it appears electrics are the clear winner ... but Hyundai will be ready for the hydrogen economy if it ever arrives.\n\nTop photo via New Atlas",

A luxury Genesis badged EV is also planned in 2021.\n\nThe firm will expand its line-up through the development of its first dedicated all-electric vehicle platform, the details of which are still under wraps. However, Hyundai says the new architecture will allow it to produce \"multiple models with longer driving ranges\".\n\nA variety of powertrain options are currently being developed, and the firm is plotting fresh hybrids alongside new EVs. Fuel cell technology is due to play an important role too, with the arrival of a new hydrogen fuelled SUV in 2018 which Hyundai has revealed in pre-production form. The firm will also unveil a hydrogen-powered bus towards the end of 2017.\n\nMuch of the planned expansion will see new hybrid SUVs and large vehicles take their place in Hyundai's line-up.

The expansion of electric vehicles and the renewable energy industry are partly behind this year's renaissance for the 17 minerals, which are also used in smartphones and consumer electronics.\n\nMainly mined in China, it is the role of rare earths in permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and wind turbines that has reignited interest.

Its performance is expected to be a 20 percent improvement over the Tucson.\n\nThanks to the carmaker's highly durable core auto parts, drivers can start the new FCEV model's engine even at minus 30 degrees Celsius.\n\nConfident of the model's durability, Hyundai Motor offers a 10-year or 160,000-kilometer warranty, the official said.\n\nHyundai Motor added it will introduce 10 hybrid electric vehicles, 11 plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, eight electric vehicles and two FCEVs by 2020.\n\nRise of FCEV\n\nUnlike an EV that uses batteries to power its motor, an FCEV uses oxygen from the air and compressed hydrogen to generate electricity to power the motor. Most FCEVs are classified as zero-emission vehicles that emit only water and heat.\n\nAnother advantage of FCEVs is that they just need hydrogen as fuel from a charge station, as each one has an internal power generator called a fuel cell stack. It takes several minutes to charge an FCEV, while a high-capacity EV takes more than 10 hours to fully charge its battery.\n\nIn recognition of such advantages, the country's leaders briskly promote the model.\n\nDuring her recent visit to Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, for example, Transport Minister Kim Hyun-mee got around in a Tucson.\n\nAccording to the ministry, Kim has relied on the FCEV since she took office in May. She reportedly takes the eco-friendly SUV when she commutes to and from Sejong, around 120 kilometers south of Seoul.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Electromechanical", "wgt": 100, "id": 170, "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Electromechanical"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Recreation", "wgt": 100, "id": 587, "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Recreation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tenan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheonan", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tenan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65867"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tucson"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tucson"}, "type": "loc", "id": "226597"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302999", "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304290", "label": {"eng": "Hybrid electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305061", "label": {"eng": "Battery (electricity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305529", "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305540", "label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroelectricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306627", "label": {"eng": "Hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307583", "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "309694", "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309701", "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309703", "label": {"eng": "Mass production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "311969", "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314837", "label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-emissions_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321029", "label": {"eng": "Zero-emissions vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_River_(Korea)", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Han River (Korea)"}, "type": "loc", "id": "410671"}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Chungcheong_Province", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Chungcheong Province"}, "type": "loc", "id": "465807"}]}

However, a local launch is yet to be confirmed.\n\nTwo LHD prototypes of the vehicle were here last month for cold-weather testing, with a team of Hyundai engineers from South Korea assessing the SUV's systems in the Snowy Mountains, New South Wales.\n\nThe SUV should cover about 800km on a single fill.\n\nMeanwhile, 20 examples of the new model will be supplied to the ACT government late next year as part of the Hornsdale Windfarm Stage 3 project.\n\nUsing Hyundai's fourth-gen hydrogen fuel cell technology, the SUV should cover about 800km on a single fill (based on European testing standards), a considerable increase over the first-gen model's claimed driving range of 594km.\n\nFurthermore, the FCEV has an efficiency level of 60 per cent, representing a nine per cent increase over the ix35 Fuel Cell's 55.3 per cent effort.\n\nMaximum power output has been boosted by 20 per cent, to 120kW, when compared to the SUV's 100kW predecessor.\n\nThe Seoul-based company says it has improved the FCEV's cold start capability, as hydrogen-powered vehicles often have trouble starting when temperatures are below freezing point.\n\nAs such, the SUV can be started at -30 degrees Celsius, thanks to the incorporation of key components, like the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and bipolar plates, into the fuel stack.\n\nDurability was also a key focus during development, with highly durable catalyst technology allowing greater longevity, according to Hyundai.\n\nThe FCEV's futuristic look inside and out is said to be inspired by nature.\n\nTank storage density has been addressed, with the FCEV featuring three equally-sized tanks, which differs to the ix35 Fuel Cell's two tanks of different sizes.\n\nAdvanced driver assistance and safety (ADAS) technologies will be available with the SUV, including new features that will be detailed at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January next year.\n\nInheriting styling cues inside and out from the FE Fuel Cell concept shown at the Geneva motor show in March, the FCEV's futuristic look is said to be inspired by nature.\n\nMinimising the SUV's drag coefficient meant flush door handles were added, as well as an air tunnel inside the D-pillar.\n\nInside, the centre console and dashboard are simplified with the implementation of side-by-side digital displays, which handle instrument cluster and multimedia system responsibilities.\n\nHyundai Motor Group has also outlined its plans for forthcoming low-emission vehicles, with 31 new models to be rolled out in global markets under the Hyundai and Kia brands by 2020.\n\nSpecifically, powertrain options will span full electric (EV), hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, allowing for plenty of customer choice.\n\nAn EV version of the Kona compact SUV due next month is being readied for a global launch in the first half of next year, with a claimed driving range of 390km.\n\nAlternatively, the first EV model under the Genesis luxury brand will arrive during 2021, while a long-range EV capable of travelling 500km on a single charge will follow soon afterwards.\n\nFuel cell vehicles will continue to be a priority for Hyundai as it looks to sustain its leadership in the area, with a hydrogen-powered bus to be uncovered in the forth quarter of this year.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 100, "id":

Three hydrogen tanks in the rear of the car provide up to 580 kilometres of practical driving range, an impovement of approximately 150km compared with the ix35 FCEV.\n\nOverseas, Hyundai became the first manufacturer to sell a fuel cell-powered car to the public, when it introduced the ix35 FCEV in select European markets in 2013, before adding Korea and the US to its sales footprint.\n\nSpeaking with TMR in Seoul, Dr Sae Hoon Kim, head of Hyundai's fuel cell research division, admits that car was a \"temporary\" measure rushed into production before it was truly ready to go on sale.\n\n\"We were the first to commercialise and mass produce this vehicle but technically it was not perfect, that I can confess,\" Dr Kim said.\n\n\"We did not solve the durability problem at the time. It was very urgent to provide our vehicle to customers, especially hydrogen station operators.\"\n\n\"The new FE is really for the general public. We have mostly solved the durability problem and the driving range will be more than 580 kilometres for one charge - compared to the Tucson, which was 425 kilometres or something like that.\"\n\nInitially Hyundai guaranteed an effective working life of four years for the ix35 FCEV, whereas the new car should be good for 10 years and 160,000 kilometres.\n\nDr Kim suggests the revised machine could boast an official driving range of up to 800 kilometres using the more lenient European fuel economy test, a number that should prove \"quite sufficient for customers\".\n\nWhile

The car's aero efficiency credentials are highlighted by recessed door handles, and even the wheels have been designed to scythe through the air as efficiently as possible.\n\nThe cabin carries over the same interior layout previewed on the Geneva concept, but toned down considerably with new materials and fittings for this close-to-production glimpse. The dual screens behind the steering wheel and on top of the dashboard remain, but the display in the centre console has been removed.\n\nThe production car will debut Hyundai's fourth-generation fuel cell when it arrives on sale. Compared with the current set-up in the ix35, the concept's set-up is 20 per cent lighter and nine per cent more efficient. The stack itself gets a 20 per cent power boost too, taking output up to 161bhp. Hyundai claims it's capable of supplying a driving range of over 360 miles, while a new tank layout means that the hydrogen is stored in denser capacities.\n\nAlongside the hydrogen tech, Hyundai promises \"advanced driver assistance technologies\", of which we'll hear more about next January at the 2018 Consumer Electronics Show. The production model's name will also be revealed at the technology exposition.\n\nThe reveal of the FCV SUV in near production form is accompanied with an updated 'eco-vehicle' roadmap. Hyundai is plotting to launch an electric version of the new Kona crossover in the first half of 2018, with a range of at least 242 miles. A luxury Genesis EV is touted to launch in 2021, while an unspecified long-range EV with at least 311 miles of range is also in the pipeline for 2021. A dedicated EV platform is planned.\n\nOur girst glimpse of Hyundai's next generation fuel cell SUV arrived back in March at the Geneva Motor Show in the firm of the FE Fuell Cell Concept.\n\nThe FE is a crossover that features ultra-slim headlights, complex surfacing around the leading edges of the front wings, and a sloping roofline that incorporates aerodynamic strakes across its supporting C-pillars.\n\nInside the dramatically lit cabin, there's a dual-screen set-up which shoulders an instrument display and the navigation system at the top of the fascia, and then a further screen in the centre console that appears to be designed for use as an infotainment system and smartphone controller.\n\nThe concept is designed to demonstrate Hyundai it is making progress in reducing the size, complexity and cost of the 'stack' - the chemical reaction chamber that's at the heart of any fuel cell vehicle.\n\n* Hyundai ix35 Fuel Cell review\n\nThis technology will form the basis for Hyundai's next fuel cell, as the firm moves away from adapting existing cars to basing new hydrogen-fuelled models on a bespoke architecture, so we won't see a Tucson-based fuel cell vehicle to replace the ix35 FCV. Speaking exclusively to Auto Express last year, Tae Won Lim, senior vice president of Hyundai's Central Advanced Research and Engineering Institute, said, \"Our target is to develop a cheaper, more durable, more reliable and more efficient system. It will be an all-new platform, special design and easy to assemble.\"\n\nThe concept recycles some of the water emitted at the FE's tailpipe; an internal air humidifier uses it to improve the cabin environment. It also features portable battery packs that are charged by the car's energy output and are able to power passenger devices, such as a laptop or a smartphone. The boot also features integrated storage and charging space for an electric scooter.\n\nNo specific launch date in 2018 has been given for the new Hyundai fuel cell vehicle, but it is expected to be significantly cheaper than the existing ix35, which costs around \u00a350,000 and has sold in tiny numbers.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 100, "id": 77, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1105, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Korea, Republic Of"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul-teukbyeolsi"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65774"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "loc", "id": "93926"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_utility_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302580", "label": {"eng": "Sport utility vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302682", "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304704", "label": {"eng": "Automobile safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_reaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305548", "label": {"eng": "Chemical reaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307587", "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308355", "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_CES", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "312203", "label": {"eng": "International CES"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "319256", "label": {"eng": "Concept car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Tucson#Second_generation_.282009.E2.80.93present.29", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "337500", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai ix35"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "362317", "label": {"eng": "Geneva Motor Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "380891", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "380893", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "427581", "label": {"eng": "Auto Express"}}]}

The new model unveiled today confirms Hyundai's global leadership in FCEVs, while heralding the beginning of a hydrogen-based society,\" Hyundai Motor Vice President Lee Kwang-kook said during the unveiling event held in Yeouido, western Seoul.\n\nThe latest FCEV boasts four upgraded features -- efficiency, performance, longevity, energy storage system -- compared to the Tuscon ix FCEV, the company said.\n\nThe Tuscon ix FCEV is the world's first-ever mass produced FCEV launched by Hyundai Motor in 2013.\n\nThe new model has a fuel economy of 60 percent, higher than the 40 percent of the Ioniq EV that was awarded the No.1 efficient vehicle by the US Environmental Protection Agency last year, the company said.\n\nFor improved driving distance, Hyundai Motor is aiming to produce a long-range FCEV that can drive over 580 kilometers on full charge.\n\nOn enhanced battery, the soon-to-be-released FCEV can also run for 10 years, 160,000 kilometers, equivalent to conventional combustion-engine powered vehicles, the company said.\n\nIn light of the rising popularity of green cars, Hyundai Motor emphasized that it will put forth all efforts to boost innovation of EVs and FCEVs that do not emit toxic gases, and increase charging infrastructure.\n\nReferring to FCEVs as \"air purifiers on wheels,\" Hyundai Motor said a unit of FCEV that runs an annual 1,500 kilometers can purify oxygen inhaled by two adults.\n\nHyundai Motor and Kia Motors sold a combined 141,681 eco-friendly cars between January and July this year, which is 10 percent more than the 128,975 units sold for the whole of 2016.\n\nHyundai will aim to roll out 31 green car models by 2020, adding three models to its original goal, the company said.\n\nThe 31 models are made up of 10 hybrid EVs, 11 plug-in EVs, 8 EVs and two FCEVs.\n\nMeanwhile, to help the public understand in depth about FCEVs, Hyundai Motor will open a FCEV house at Yeouido Han River Park for free of charge until Nov. 17, the company said.\n\nVisitors will be able to experience a \"future home\" where electronics operate on energy made by the next generation FCEV.\n\nBy Kim Bo-gyung (lisakim425@heraldcorp.com)", "date":

India's government has already announced a goal of achieving a completely electric transport system by 2030. While some point to the overly ambitious nature of the target, experts say the government's push to adopt electric vehicles will open up lucrative opportunities for players with a strong electric vehicle portfolio.\n\nHyundai's announcement comes amid criticism that it has been neglecting its electric mobility strategy. On Thursday however, it announced that it is placing electric vehicles at the centre of its product strategy and that it has plans for a premium long-distance electric car as it seeks to catch up to Tesla.

Firstly, system efficiency is now up to 60% thanks to the improved performance and hydrogen utilization rate of the fuel cell, as well as the optimisation of components. As such, Hyundai targets a range of 580 km with this car.\n\nMeanwhile, variable pressure control technology allows for a maximum power output of 163 PS, 20% higher than before. A membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and metal separator technology, key components of a hydrogen electrocatalyst fuel cell system, have also been included, while an FCEV-optimised production system that incorporates core components has increased the localisation of the technology, reducing cost.\n\nCold starts is another issue with FCEVs that Hyundai has sought to tackle, with the new model being able to start at minus 30 degrees Celsius. The company has also managed to achieve the world's highest hydrogen storage density by optimising the hydrogen tank , and claims that its fuel cell will be able to last 160,000 km over the course of 10 years, the equivalent of a regular internal combustion engine.\n\nThe design of the new FCEV is certainly distinctive, with bi-level headlights similar to the Kona B-segment SUV. The upper LED daytime running lights, are joined together by a chrome bar and is said to be inspired by the horizon. This signifies the present and the future, symbolising the company's hydrogen technology. Front and centre is the signature Cascading Grille.\n\nAlong the sides, airflow passes through an air curtain in the front bumper and flows towards the rear of the car, over the two-piece aerodynamic alloy wheels. Flush-mounted door handles and an air tunnel in the D-pillars also contribute to aerodynamic efficiency, while a cut in the D-pillars gives the SUV a floating roof look.\n\nInside, there's a horizontal dashboard layout and a high centre console that is said to maximise space and ensure a \"unique sense of boarding.\" A flat panel with large twin displays, one for the instruments and the other for the infotainment system, has also been fitted, reminiscent of the Mercedes-Benz E- and S-Class.\n\nAside from the new hydrogen vehicle, Hyundai also plans to launch 10 hybrid vehicles, 11 plug-in hybrids and eight electric vehicles, including mid- and full-size hybrid SUVs, a Kona-based EV with a 390 km range and a dedicated EV capable of travelling over 500 km on a single charge.

Having teased us with the FE Fuel Cell Concept in Geneva, Hyundai has given the world a fleeting glimpse of the hydrogen-fueled SUV it plans to launch next year.\n\nAt the core of the new FE SUV will be an overhauled iteration of the Hyundai fuel cell. The company has been selling a production hydrogen vehicle since 2013 - albeit in limited numbers - and says the new car will take advantage of the lessons learned in that vehicle. That means better range, efficiency and performance, all of which are obviously good things.\n\nWhen it arrives in production form, the car will have 20 percent more power than its ix35 (aka Tucson) Fuel Cell predecessor, with 120 kW (161 hp) on tap. Those living in extreme climates will be pleased to know it will start in temperatures as cold as -30\u00b0 C (-22\u00b0 F) thanks to its fresh fuel cell, with two left-hand-drive FE prototypes having recently undergone cold-weather testing in Australia's Snow Mountains as part of a global testing and durability program. Hyundai also says the new fuel cell construction reduces production costs.\n\nHydrogen will be stored in three equal-sized tanks, rather than the two odd-sized ones in the current ix35 Fuel Cell. The tanks make use of a new plastic liner to squeeze more fuel in than before, one factor that contributes to the claimed 580-km (360-mi) range. The fuel cell itself is claimed to operate at 60 percent efficiency, which is a nine percent improvement over the current car.\n\nAs for the way the car looks, the split headlight design mirrors that of the recently-released Kona, while the smooth surfacing on the flanks was apparently chosen to reflect the \"technical maturity and cutting-edge technology\" hiding within - whatever that means. Flush door handles, an air curtain behind the front grille and an aerodynamic tunnel running through the D-pillar have all been fitted to help the SUV slice through the air with greater efficiency.\n\nInside, screens have been used to reduce clutter on the dashboard, while the seats are trimmed in a combination of woven fabric and suede, which certainly look comfortable in the sole interior image provided.\n\nPricing is yet to be announced, but Hyundai says the production SUV will launched next year in South Korea, with North America and Europe to follow shortly thereafter.

(Hyundai Motor Group)\n\nAmid declining sales of Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors in and out of Korea, demand for eco-friendly cars made by the country's two top carmakers is increasing, data by the company showed.\n\nHyundai Motor and Kia Motors sold a combined 141,681 eco-friendly cars between January and July this year, which is 10 percent more than the 128,975 units sold for the whole of 2016.\n\nEco-friendly cars offered by the two consist of 14 models -- six hybrids, three electric vehicles, four plug-in hybrids and one fuel cell EV.\n\nBy engine type, sales of hybrid models ranked No.1, totaling 119,780 units, followed by EVs and plug-in hybrids.\n\nSales of plug-in hybrids jumped fivefold to 8,485 units in the cited period, showing the biggest rise in sales due to the popularity of the Niro plug-in hybrid SUV, company data showed.\n\nAmong the 141,681 eco-friendly cars sold, overseas sales totaled 105,383 units, up 35.3 percent on-year.\n\n\"The Ionic hybrid and Niro plug-in hybrid models are garnering huge popularity from motorists worldwide. We plan to diversify the eco-friendly lineup and also expand sales,\" Hyundai Motor said.\n\nChina's new energy vehicles policy, however, is widely expected to pose hurdles for Hyundai and Kia Motors alongside other auto-related Korean companies operating there.\n\nUnder the dual-credit scheme, automakers will be required to meet a minimum fuel efficiency rate. They will also have to increase the portion of zero- and low-emission vehicles to 8 percent of total cars made next year. The ratio will gradually rise to 10 percent in 2019 and 12 percent in 2020.\n\nCarmakers that fail to meet the requirement can either buy credits from other companies or pay a fine.\n\n\"Most carmakers will not be able to meet the given target, so the new policy has to be delayed by a year,\" the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association said.\n\nAccording to the KAMA, it had sent a letter requesting the Chinese government delay the introduction of the dual-credit scheme and to soften measures imposed on Korean battery makers last June.\n\nThe request was jointly made with the American Automotive Policy Council, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association.\n\nThe KAMA's request comes as Hyundai Motor looks to miss its sales quota for eco-friendly cars for next year by about 4,800 units, as the electric version of the Yuedong compact sedan, sold as the Elantra globally, released earlier this month is currently the only EV model offered in the Chinese market.\n\nIn an attempt to secure a piece of China's ever-growing EV market, Hyundai Motor will raise the number of eco-friendly models there to six by 2020, including the plug-in hybrid version of the top-selling Sonata midsize sedan set for release early next year, the company said.\n\nBy Kim Bo-gyung (lisakim425@heraldcorp.com)", "date": "2017-08-15",

Its next creation builds upon that legacy, but it charts its own path at the same time.\n\nHyundai unveiled the Next Generation FCEV crossover at an event on Thursday. The unoriginally named concept features a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain with plenty of revisions over the Tucson's unit, as well as a new dose of design that gives it a premium feeling not found on the Tucson.\n\nThe system in this concept is actually Hyundai's fourth-generation fuel cell. Its efficiency is up over the Tucson, which helps contribute to its estimated full-tank range of 500 miles. It's 20 percent more powerful, at about 160 horsepower. It can start in temperatures as low as 22 degrees Fahrenheit, too. The compressed hydrogen gas is stored in three equally sized tanks to help balance the vehicle.\n\nIn terms of style, the FCEV looks much closer to production than its forebear, the FE Concept, which debuted at the Geneva Motor Show earlier this year. The exterior now has a more traditional grille, and the fact that it's a crossover should surprise precisely no one, given how much the market loves crossovers. It's also a far cry from the Genesis GV80 concept we saw at the New York Auto Show.\n\nInside, things are looking pretty premium, closer to a Genesis than a Hyundai. The interior is pretty spartan, focusing its switchgear on the center stack and leaving things pretty clean otherwise. The gauge cluster is a screen, and right next to it is an equally large infotainment screen. The center console rises up to meet the vents like in the Lexus RX. It's a good look.\n\nIf you want more details on the car, you're going to have to wait until January. Hyundai plans to discuss the car's advanced driver-assist systems, as well as its actual name, at CES 2018 in Las Vegas. You can bet your bottom dollar that we'll be there in person to bring you all the details.\n\n7 Hydrogen gets stylish with Hyundai's new FCEV crossover concept Tags Hyundai Fuel Cell Cars Electric Cars Crossovers", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tucson"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson,_Arizona", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucson"}, "type": "loc", "id": "226597"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302572", "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303005", "label": {"eng": "Cell (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303315", "label": {"eng": "Automobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304110", "label": {"eng": "Gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "307583", "label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309692", "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309703", "label": {"eng": "Mass production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311523", "label": {"eng": "Media market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_CES", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "312203", "label": {"eng": "International CES"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "314837", "label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "330978", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336356", "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "353148", "label": {"eng": "Hyundai Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "362317", "label": {"eng": "Geneva Motor Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus_RX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "366961", "label": {"eng": "Toyota Harrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "375115", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_International_Auto_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "380211", "label": {"eng": "New York International Auto Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "393142", "label": {"eng": "Grille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchgear", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "411762", "label": {"eng": "Switchgear"}}]}

It will also assist those participating in the value chain of alternatives, such as batteries and supercapacitors, to understand the considerable opportunities for both collaborative use of their components with fuel cells and scope for common technologies.\n\nInterest is re-igniting in vehicle fuel cells after decades of minimal uptake primarily caused by high costs and lack of hydrogen infrastructure but also affected by several other challenges appraised in this report. It is easy to rehearse why fuel cells in vehicles are in the trough of disillusionment but look closer and things are stirring as we progress to more sober forecasts and market positioning to get there.\n\nIndeed now is the time to invest, when so many companies have left the business but the first sales in thousands of fuel cell vehicles - in the form of forklifts - are happening without subsidies and you can newly buy fuel cell cars from top names. From Taiwan and Japan, fuel cell scooters now look plausible, the USA uses fuel cells in military vehicles and now fuel cell buses and cars are even shown to double as the emergency electricity supplies sought in Japan.\n\nMost western automotive manufacturers are preparing fuel cell vehicles for sale but nothing is guaranteed, because, as this report analyses, the other option for zero pollution at point of use, the pure electric battery or supercapacitor vehicle, is also improving rapidly and they will often go head to head in the marketplace. Which will have predominantly green \"\"fuel\"\" first - fuel cell or battery alone? Which will cost least up front and over life? What performance will really be achieved? For example, refueling time is not fast if you take ages to get to a refueling station. Energy density of the fuel is irrelevant if the powertrain using it is larger and heavier. This report pricks the bubbles to reveal the genuinely good prospects and the PEM fuel cell, intelligently applied, is one of them.\n\nCompanies Mentioned\n\nKey Topics Covered:\n\n1.

The report covers the market landscape and its growth prospects\n\nover the coming years. The report also includes a discussion of the key\n\nvendors operating in this market.\n\nOne trend in the market is adoption of fuel cells to decrease dependency\n\non imported oil. Fuel cell chemistries, such as lithium-oxygen and\n\nmicrobial fuel cells, are gradually gaining traction and ensure high\n\nenergy density levels comparable to fossil fuels. These characteristics\n\nmake them ideal for robust transportation-related energy requirements.\n\nSince fuel cells are actively used in military transportation, research\n\nactivities may be initiated for short to mid-term needs.\n\nAccording to the report, one driver in the market is improved\n\nperformance with high torque and low revolutions. Despite the limited\n\navailability of infrastructure for fuel cells compared to fossil-fuel\n\npowered drivetrains, fuel cells project a higher efficiency of about 60%\n\nto 80%. As conventional vehicles do not carry out complete fuel\n\ncombustion, the efficiency of the vehicle drops compared to the\n\nconventional IC engine. The diesel engine utilizes the fuel present in\n\nthe vehicle to generate torque, leading to a lower number of revolutions\n\ncompared to those vehicles that operate on fuel cell technology.\n\nKey vendors\n\nProtonex\n\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/z3pgwq/global_defense\n\nView source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170816005461/en/", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 480, "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable", "wgt": 100, "id": 601, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Renewable"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell_Biology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1104, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Cell Biology"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology", "wgt": 100, "id": 1105, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Biotechnology"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302743", "label": {"eng": "Fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303009", "label": {"eng": "Transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303478", "label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303871", "label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304034", "label": {"eng": "Torque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304158", "label": {"eng": "Diesel engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_combustion_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304292", "label": {"eng": "Internal combustion engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305421", "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305529", "label": {"eng": "Oxygen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305543", "label": {"eng": "Lithium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307847", "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309998", "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314837", "label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_annual_growth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315204", "label": {"eng": "Compound annual growth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315207", "label": {"eng": "Market analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "323422", "label": {"eng": "Combustion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "330237", "label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "373958", "label": {"eng": "Energy density"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbial_fuel_cell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "490294", "label": {"eng": "Microbial fuel cell"}}]}

(August 14, 2017) - We've all been there - that \"will-I-make-it?\" moment. If you're lucky enough to have avoided that experience, then you've heard it from the mouths of others - probably with a few nervous chuckles thrown in. For most, it's the first time, and hopefully last, as well as a valuable learning point. I had one of those moments. Here is my story.\n\nIt had been about a week since we arrived at our operating location. We had flown the route daily, some days with multiple turns, and had a good lay of the land. We were flying humanitarian relief missions and would launch from our airfield, fly up to 40 minutes to a remote staging area, pick up patients and fly them to a Navy hospital ship a few miles offshore for surgery. Given the remote area we were operating in and the distance to our airfield and refueling, our UH-60L was equipped with two full crashworthy external fuel system tanks. We were trained and familiar with CEFS and it was common knowledge that you could expect to get about 4.5 hours of continuous cruise flight from a full bag of gas. Our mission profile had us flying hops of seven to 10 minutes from our staging area with substantial ground time for passenger loading and unloading. This gave us significantly more station time.\n\nWe'd been conducting this mission for a week and routinely refueled and swapped out crews around the five-hour mark. Normally, by the time we landed (at the five-hour mark), we still had over an hour of fuel remaining and it was never an issue. This particular day, though, we had an early show. That made fuel, not time, our limiting factor. We departed as on any other day, but with an added eye on fuel checks. I did the routine fuel checks as we entered our mission profile, then closed out and continuously monitored our fuel during the mission.\n\nThe five-hour mark was drawing near. According to our fuel numbers, we had about an hour and 20 minutes of fuel remaining. We wondered, \"Do we have time for one more load?\" We decided we had enough time to take another load of passengers out to the ship and then head back to our airfield for refueling. According to our fuel checks, we'd still have about an hour's fuel remaining after we dropped off the patients. Feeling confident, we decided we were good to go.\n\nAfter dropping off the last patients, we proceeded back to the airfield. I started another fuel check for the flight back and closed it out after 15 minutes. This time, however, I noticed we were burning fuel at a slightly higher rate. No big deal, I thought; I'd just continue to monitor and we'd be fine. Ten minutes later, we were still burning more fuel than expected, further eroding our reserve. We were 10 minutes away from landing and down to 400 pounds of fuel. For anyone who's ever flown with CEFS tanks, you know that's enough to be nerve wracking.\n\nWe crested the last hills and entered the city limits. By then we were within five minutes of landing, but we also had less than 300 pounds of fuel and still needed to overfly the city to reach the airfield on the far side. Given our situation, we started looking for places where we could make a forced landing and also scanned for the best route around the city. We decided to skirt the city's edge and follow the beach. If we had to put the Black Hawk down, that's where we would do it.\n\nWith between 150 and 200 pounds of fuel remaining and both fuel-low caution lights flashing, we were cleared for landing. We flew the straight-in approach down the runway and proceeded to our ramp for shutdown. By that time, we had between 90 and 120 pounds fuel remaining on the fuel gauge. Once we landed, there was some nervous laughter and a few chuckles - but at least we were safe.\n\nWe talked about what went wrong during our crew after-action report. When we launched on that final mission, we had plenty of fuel, plus a reserve. We'd been continually doing fuel checks that day during our earlier flight legs and thought we knew what to expect. So why were things so different on that last leg?\n\nAs it turned out, we did our earlier fuel checks while flying short legs between the ship and shore or in holding patterns at maximum endurance airspeed waiting for the ship's deck to be cleared. We didn't think to note the fuel burn rate from our first long flight in the morning as a guide for the fuel required to get back.\n\nWhat about our common knowledge of CEFS burn rates? We had hundreds of hours in CEFS aircraft, so we should have known what to expect. When I checked the fuel that day during our hops out to the ship and back, everything appeared normal. How could there have been such a big change in our burn rate on that last hop?\n\nThe answer, as it turned out, was simple. On our earlier legs, we flew slower and, as a result, burned less fuel. However, on the last flight leg we were operating overwater with passengers onboard. As a safety egress precaution for overwater flight, we had opened the cargo doors on both sides of the aircraft and removed the cockpit doors. That created extra drag, which increased our fuel consumption. Our mission nearly ended in catastrophe because we didn't take that into account. The only thing that saved us was operating by the book and ensuring we had the required reserve when we left the operating area.\n\nWhat about you? When you plan your reserve, do you take into consideration that the flight profile for your return flight may be different than your mission profile? Remember, you might run out of fuel, but you'll never run out of gravity.\n\nKnowledge magazine is always looking for contributing authors to provide ground, aviation, driving and off-duty safety articles.

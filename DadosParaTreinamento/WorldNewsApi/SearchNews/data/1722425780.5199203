The vehicle came to a stop inside the Hawaii Nail & Spa store in Deer Park about 4:40 p.m. All of those killed and injured were inside the salon at the time, Lt. Kevin Heissenbuttel said. It was not immediately clear whether the crash was accidental or intentional, Heissenbuttel said. Investigators were on the scene into the evening. Photos from the scene showed a gaping hole in the storefront, which is located in a strip mall. Eric Perez told Newsday he was loading groceries into his car across from the accident scene when he heard the sound of a speeding car and then a noise that \u201csounded like shattering.\u201d \"It was a sound that I never heard before,\u201d he said. As he and his wife were leaving the parking lot, he said, he saw emergency crews removing victims from the scene. \u201cWe saw the ambulance and emergency workers pulling one body out,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I saw two women I think worked there come out on stretchers.\u201d Suffolk County police did not immediately respond to emailed requests for information.", "summary": "A fire official says a minivan has slammed into a Long Island nail salon, killing four people and injuring 9", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long-island-ap-newsday-b2570972.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/29/01/Car_Rams_Salon_26009.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:06:24", "author": "Carolyn Thompson", "authors": ["Carolyn Thompson"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.523}

Meanwhile, based on the complaint lodged by the family of the girl on Wednesday, the Falaknuma police booked a case on Thursday. \"We are waiting for the police to take action,\" the girl's father Syed Afsar said.\n\nAfsar lodged a complaint against his sister Ghousia Bi and her husband Sikender who were responsible for getting their daughter married to the aged Omani. The Falaknuma police have registered a case against Ghousia Bi, Sikender, an unnamed qazi and the Omani national under IPC sections 420 (cheating), 506 (intimidation), read with 34 (criminal act done together). Police said the Omani national is 77 years old.\n\nWhile Ghousia is said to be in Oman, her husband Sikender, who lives in the city, is reportedly absconding.\n\nThe case of the minor girl being married off to an Arab sheikh, who is old enough to be her grandfather, has once again brought the spotlight on qazis who perform such marriages. In this case, the name of the qazi is also not known to the parents. Even the Omani national's name is only mentioned as Ahmed.\n\nAccording to sources, minor girls being married off to Arab sheikhs has been clandestinely happening in the city for some time now. A hotel owner is also said to be part of the racket as he provided accommodation in his house for visiting sheikhs.\n\nOn Thursday, TOI had reported about the minor girl being forced into marriage with the Omani national by her father's sister Ghousia, a resident of Teegalkunta.\n\nAfsar, a resident of Nawab Saheb Kunta, works in function halls as a labourer. His sister and brother-in-law reportedly sold the minor girl to the Arab sheikh for Rs 5 lakh and the marriage was performed at a hotel in Barkas before Ramzan.\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "loc", "id": "104"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}, "type": "loc", "id": "172"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Muscat"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat,_Oman", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscat"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8595"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302901", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304555", "label": {"eng": "Marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304679", "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sayyid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309438", "label": {"eng": "Sayyid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309890", "label": {"eng": "Arab people"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "316851"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317102", "label": {"eng": "Qadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336401", "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "341654", "label": {"eng": "Child development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushma_Swaraj", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "342477", "label": {"eng": "Sushma Swaraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "377045", "label": {"eng": "Nawab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneka_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "501525", "label": {"eng": "Maneka Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falaknuma_railway_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "971175", "label": {"eng": "Falaknuma railway station"}}]}

Satyanarayana. The qazi could not be formally arrested as he is recuperating following a bypass surgery.\n\nAccording to the police, the Omani national, identified only as Ahmed, is 77 years old.

She and her husband along with their contacts here allegedly lured the girl's parents with the promise that their daughter would lead a lavish life.\n\nHe said in most such cases, poor and illiterate families in the old city married off their young daughters to aged 'sheikhs'.\n\nHowever, in majority of the nine cases dealt by police the aged 'shiekhs' were from poor families. \"In two cases the sheikhs were beggars and had also forced their wives to beg,\" he said.\n\nHe said the police were keeping a close watch on 60 brokers who were identified during the investigation of these cases in recent years. However, brokers based in Mumbai and even abroad were carrying on their activities by duping poor and illiterate families.\n\n--IANS\n\nms/ahm/mr\n\nSEARCH", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Men", "wgt": 100, "id": 211, "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Men"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Packaging", "wgt": 100, "id": 481, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Packaging"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Fastpitch", "wgt": 100, "id": 1143, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Fastpitch"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}, "type": "loc", "id": "172"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Muscat"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat,_Oman", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscat"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8595"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302557", "label": {"eng": "Law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302901", "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303472", "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_(document)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304460", "label": {"eng": "Visa (document)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304940", "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305160", "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Asian_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305741", "label": {"eng": "Indo-Asian News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309091", "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "315122", "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "316851"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "317102", "label": {"eng": "Qadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "324350", "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushma_Swaraj", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342477", "label": {"eng": "Sushma Swaraj"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_External_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "357089", "label": {"eng": "Minister of External Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_of_police_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "433668", "label": {"eng": "Superintendent of police (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "461256", "label": {"eng": "Begum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Women_and_Child_Development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "462059", "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Women and Child Development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneka_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "501525", "label": {"eng": "Maneka Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falaknuma_railway_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "971175", "label": {"eng": "Falaknuma railway station"}}]}

Her paternal aunt Ghousia Begum and her husband Sikander Shaikh also showed her similar videos to convince her to 'marry' the sheikh for a luxurious life but did not tell her that they were actually selling her for Rs 5 lakhs. Officials at Falaknuma police station are trying to establish contact with the 16-year-old girl who called her mother recently and pleaded to be rescued from the clutches of the sheikh who was allegedly mistreating her.\n\nAdditional Inspector of Falaknuma Police Station T Murali Krishna said that until the kazi who performed the marriage is arrested they will not know when and where the marriage took place. \"The marriage happened sometime during Ramzan but we do not know the exact date. The girl's mother is also not sure. The girl's uncle is absconding while her aunt is in Muscat,\" Krishna said.\n\nAs officials tried to put together the pieces, it has come out that living in abject poverty, the girl and her younger brother were largely dependent on their father's sister Ghousia Begum. Their father Saiyed Afsar works as a dailywager at a function hall and spends most of his money on liquor, while their mother Saiyeedunissa stayed at home. The girl used to attend a government school located opposite Ghousia Begum's house and she and her brother spent much of their time at the aunt's house, even staying there for weeks together.\n\nIn May, Ghousia told Saiyeedunissa about a marriage proposal from a rich Omani sheikh for her daughter but she immediately rejected it saying her daughter was only 16 and she did not want to marry her abroad and to an old man. However, the girl was secretly married to the sheikh at a lodge in Chandrayangutta area, during Ramzaan when the girl had gone to stay with her aunt.\n\nAfter spending four days with her, the sheikh dropped her back at Ghousia's house asking them to arrange for a passport. He went back to Muscat from where he sent a visa for the girl. \"Sikander and Ghousia contacted an agent who arranged for Aadhar card and passport for the girl. In July Ghousia and the girl flew to Muscat and went to the sheikh's house where they are living,\" an official said. Officials are also trying to find out the relationship between Ghousia and the sheikh because she is also living with him in the same house. The girl's mother Saiyedunnisa says that she and her husband only came to know of their daughter's marriage after she called from Muscat and pleaded to be rescued last week.\n\n\"When they confronted Sikander, he said their daughter was living happily in Muscat, and gifted a used two-wheeler and an air cooler to Saiyed Afsar, and a mobile phone to Saiyedunissa. It was only after she got the mobile phone she could establish contact with her daughter who pleaded to be rescued,\" leader of Majlis Bachao Tehreek (MBT) Amjedullah Khan, who helped the woman lodge the police complaint said. When the girl's mother directly spoke with the sheikh he told her that he had paid Rs 5 lakhs to Ghousia and Sikander and that he would release her only if the money is returned. Police is looking for Sikander and an agent named Mohammed Haji who are both absconding.\n\nFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Children's", "wgt": 100, "id": 178, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing/Children's"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations", "wgt": 100, "id": 258, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Scouting/Organizations"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Fraternal", "wgt": 100, "id": 498, "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Fraternal"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Fastpitch", "wgt": 100, "id": 1143, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Fastpitch"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}, "type": "loc", "id": "172"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Muscat"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscat,_Oman", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muscat"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8595"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "type": "loc", "id": "8818"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303239", "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304679", "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307060", "label": {"eng": "Game of Thrones"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "316851"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Malhotra", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "350790", "label": {"eng": "Manish Malhotra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burj_Khalifa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "442079", "label": {"eng": "Burj Khalifa"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrayan_Gutta", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chandrayan Gutta"}, "type": "loc", "id": "748950"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falaknuma_railway_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "971175", "label": {"eng": "Falaknuma railway station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majlis_Bachao_Tehreek", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "1225740", "label": {"eng": "Majlis Bachao Tehreek"}}]}

The proposal was initiated by her sister-in-law and her husband.\n\nBut keeping the parents in the dark, the relatives convinced the young girl to accompany them to a hotel in Barkhas of the Old City to meet the aged groom. Enticing her with videos and photographs of a lavish life that she could lead in the Gulf, they performed the 'nikah' in the hotel with a help of a khazi.\n\n'Daughter in distress'\n\nThe girl was taken back to her house in Teekalkunta four days after the Omani national left for his country. The aged man sent a visa for the minor girl after Ramzan. Her aunt had accompanied the girl to Muscat, the girl's mother said in a complaint to the Falaknuma Police.\n\nThe woman said her daughter was in distress and wept every time she spoke over phone. She had pleaded that she be brought back. As the woman's plea that her sister-in-law's husband talk to Ahmed and secure the return of her daughter failed to move him, she spoke to the Omani national and demanded that her daughter be sent back. But the man demanded that she first return the \u20b95 lakh that he allegedly paid to her sister-in-law and her husband.\n\nWhen the woman confronted her sister-in-law's husband, he threatened her and her husband with dire consequences. The hapless woman then approached the police. Assistant Commissioner of Police, Falaknuma, Md. Tajuddin Ahmed told The Hindu that a First Information Report had been registered.

(For representation only) Marriage at the age of 14 is allowed in the US. New York State just banned itTwelve million child marriages, despite decline, says surveyNine arrested for 'child marriage' in Vadodara\n\nThe mother of a 16-year-old Hyderabadi girl who was married off to a 65-year-old sheikh from Oman has lodged a police complaint and requested help to bring her back from Oman.\n\nSaiyeeda Shaikh, a resident of Nawab Kunta area, lodged the police complaint after her daughter called her from Oman on Wednesday and confided that she wants to return home as she was not liking it there. Saiyeeda stated that her husband Sikander had taken their daughter to his sister Ghousia's house to stay for a few days.\n\n\"At her house, my husband and his sister hatched the plan to marry off my daughter to the sheikh from Oman. The sheikh paid Rs 5 lakhs to my husband. They kept me in the dark and secretly got her married at a function hall. They stayed for four days in a hotel and then he dropped her off at Ghousia's house until her passport and visa was done then she too flew to Oman,'' she stated in her complaint.\n\nShe said she spoke with the sheikh on phone and he told her he had \"bought'' her daughter from Sikander by paying Rs 5 lakhs. \"My husband convinced my daughter to marry the sheikh by showing videos of luxurious life style in his villa in Oman. I did not want my daughter to get married so early. Now she does not want to stay there,'' she said.\n\nHowever, cops are not convinced with Saiyeeda's version of the story. \"She and her husband live separately but it is not possible that she did not know about her daughter's marriage. Her daughter was away at her aunt's house for nearly three months before getting married. We have called her husband and sister-in-law for inquiry. We are searching for the qazi who performed the marriage illegally,'' Assistant Commissioner Mohammed Tajuddin said.\n\nAfter initial inquiry cops found out that there was a dispute between Sikander and his estranged wife over sharing of money due to which she decided to lodge a police complaint.\n\nFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: child marriage", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "wgt": 100, "id": 203, "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Fraternal", "wgt": 100, "id": 498, "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Fraternal"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "wgt": 100, "id": 737, "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Consumer_Information/Advocacy_and_Protection", "wgt": 100, "id": 1237, "label": "dmoz/Home/Consumer Information/Advocacy and Protection"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1631, "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oman", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sultanate of Oman"}, "type": "loc", "id": "172"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vadodara"}, "type": "loc", "id": "51427"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York"}, "type": "loc", "id": "218051"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302532", "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "303301", "label": {"eng": "Muhammad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303926", "label": {"eng": "Passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_(document)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304460", "label": {"eng": "Visa (document)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304555", "label": {"eng": "Marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304679", "label": {"eng": "Sheikh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306100", "label": {"eng": "Lakh"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hyderabad"}, "type": "loc", "id": "316851"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qadi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "317102", "label": {"eng": "Qadi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "332765", "label": {"eng": "Child marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawab", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "377045", "label": {"eng": "Nawab"}}]}

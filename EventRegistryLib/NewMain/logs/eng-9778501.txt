But it's a curious business, the flag at Buckingham Palace.\n\n\"There are certain things, you know, that I can deliver straight away. But I'm not sure it's going to be as easy as it looks, even if it's right, to please the public on this one.\"\n\n\"Fellowes knew his boss,\" Lacey continued. \"No flag in history had flown at halfmast over Buckingham Palace. The Queen had not done it on the death of her beloved father George VI, and she would not expect it for herself.\n\n\"It was a matter of tradition -- something greater than oneself, symbolizing for Elizabeth II values approaching the sacred. It was certainly not a gesture to be conceded to the popular media.\"\n\nFellowes and the queen's press secretary Geoffrey Crawford raised the issue \"with the Queen herself.\"\n\n\"There was clearly a need for a change of royal direction -- and Elizabeth II got it immediately. Suddenly the details of what flag flew where counted for nothing.\"\n\nThe problem was solved when they flew the Union Jack, rather than the royal standard, at half mast in honor of Diana.\n\nAccording to The Palace Papers, Fellowes was ultimately pushed out during tensions with Charles' office in the years after Diana's death.\n\n\"After 22 years of service,\" Brown wrote. \"Fellowes had at last quit his job on the heels of a stitch- up in the Mail on Sunday.\n\n\"The paper accused him of being 'one of the prime instruments in the destruction of the monarchy's public esteem', which was hardly fair.\n\n\"He blamed the piece on [spin doctor Mark] Bolland, who shared the Prince of Wales's conviction that Fellowes was the major blockade in Buckingham Palace's acceptance of Camilla.\n\n\"The Queen showed her gratitude to her faithful private secretary by ensuring he was given a life peerage as Baron Fellowes of Shotesham in Norfolk in her Birthday Honours List of 1999.\"\n\nMore recently, he was a guest at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding at St George's Chapel, in Windsor Castle, on May 19, 2020.\n\nIt is entirely possible both William and Harry will be invited to the funeral, though if so there will inevitably be questions about whether both can attend given the extent of the rift between them.\n\nJack Royston is Newsweek's chief royal correspondent, based in London.

He has died at 82.\n\nHe leaves behind his wife Jane William and Harry's aunt and an elder sister to Princess Diana after a marriage spanning four decades. Together they had three children (Laura, Alexander, and Eleanor), making them direct cousins to the princes.\n\nLaura holds the special role of godmother to Princess Charlotte. Beyond familial ties, Lord Fellowes had a significant professional link to the monarchy.\n\nHe served as private secretary to the Queen amid the tumultuous waves of the 1990s, a period marred by controversy and personal tragedy for the royals.\n\nHe was in office when Diana, Princess of Wales, his own sister-in-law, died in a Paris car accident in 1997, aged just 36. As part of the inner circle that advised the Royal Family through these choppy waters, according to The Times obituary tribute, he was a contributor to the speech made by the Queen from Buckingham Palace on the eve of Diana's funeral, reports the Mirror.\n\nUpon her untimely death, Lord Fellowes expressed personal sorrow: \"I was deeply fond of her. She was a very good person. She found it difficult in life to find happiness, and I'm sad for people who have that situation.\"\n\nHis role led to his portrayal in the popular Netflix series, The Crown, where he was played by Andrew Havill. He continued as an extra equerry to the late Queen until her passing in 2022.\n\nHe died on Monday at the age of 82 from undisclosed causes.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_rowlands@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Robert Rowlands", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jennifer_newton@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Jennifer Newton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fellowes,_Baron_Fellowes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_royal_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British royal family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Charlotte_of_Wales_(born_2015)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Princess Charlotte of Wales (born 2015)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Havill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Havill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crown (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equerry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Royalty", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Monarchy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large_Families", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Large Families", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Publications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.coventrytelegraph.net/incoming/article28819436.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_harrywills.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9778501", "eventUri": "eng-9778501", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

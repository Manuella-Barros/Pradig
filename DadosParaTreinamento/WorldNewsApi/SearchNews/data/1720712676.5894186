Maintaining that Haryana was supplying water in an adequate manner, the official of the Irrigation and Water Resources Department, who did not wish to be named, said transmission losses, which include evaporation and seepage losses, are not being accounted for by the Delhi government. As per the dimensions of the Munak canal, the channel supplying water from Haryana to Delhi, 13 per cent to 17 per cent water can be lost, the official said. Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) V K Saxena will meet state Cabinet minister Atishi on Monday after the latter sought an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d with him over the issue of alleged non-release of water by the Haryana government. The L-G has also asked his officials to ascertain the present status of water released by Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. According to a post on X by Raj Niwas, Delhi, the official account of the L-G Secretariat, Saxena has \"further directed the officers concerned to take up the matter with Upper Yamuna River Board to ascertain the facts wrt release of water to Delhi\u201d. In addition, the L-G has asked for measures to be implemented to check wastage and leakage of water in the city, including the status of desilting of Wazirabad reservoir, as directed by the Supreme Court. Earlier on Sunday, in a letter written to Haryana Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini, Atishi had sought an urgent intervention on the alleged non-release of water into the Yamuna River. She wrote, \u201cOn an average, the water received at the Bawana contact point \u2014 even in the summers \u2014 is between 980 and 1,030 cusecs\u2026 However in the last one week, this has seen a drastic reduction.\u201d When asked about the alleged insufficient release of water from Haryana, the official quoted above said an adequate quantity of water is being supplied by Haryana. Delhi receives water from the Ganga via the Upper Ganga Canal in Uttar Pradesh, and from the Yamuna and Ravi-Beas rivers via the carrier-lined channel (CLC) and the Delhi sub-branch (DSB) canals. The city is allocated 1,050 cusecs of water. However, as per the latest bulletin of the DJB, only 840 cusecs of water was released via the CLC and DSB on Friday as opposed to an average of 953.44 cusecs last week. After an inspection of the Munak canal on Saturday, the minister sought an emergency meeting with the L-G. \u201cHave sought time from the Hon\u2019ble @LtGovDelhi for an emergency meeting, to apprise him of the inadequate water being released by Haryana from the Munak Canal. Delhi is supposed to receive 1050 cusecs of water from the Munak Canal via the CLC and DSB sub-canals. However, this has reduced to 840 cusecs,\u201d Atishi posted on X on Sunday. Atishi said the seven water treatment plants in Delhi are dependent on water from the Munak canal, and that there will be a crisis in Delhi in a day or two if this requirement is not met. There are nine treatment plants in Delhi, out of which seven get water mainly via the sub-canals of the Munak canal. According to data from the Delhi Jal Board (DJB), the total water production in June remained less than 500 MGD (millions of gallons per day). Since June 1, the production has not crossed 498 MGD, which is 50 MGD less than the allocated amount (after transmission loss). In May, DJB reported an average water production of 495.31 MGD.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/water-delhi-shortfall-evaporation-losses-heat-haryana-9382050/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/delhi-water-shortage.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:19:46", "author": "Sophiya Mathew", "authors": ["Sophiya Mathew"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.305}

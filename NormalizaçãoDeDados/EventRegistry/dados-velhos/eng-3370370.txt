Bill Moran, the deputy chief of naval operations, said that Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin relieved Cmdr. Bryce Benson for cause after a report detailing the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and the freighter ACX Crystal was released by the Navy.\n\nThe ship's entire leadership, Moran said, will be relieved, and about a dozen sailors face punishment, including all of the destroyer's watch.\n\nThe command team of three have been relieved. About nine others face non-judicial punishment.\n\nFurther sanctions are possible, Moran said.\n\nAucoin acted swiftly because the investigation indicated serious mistakes were made by the crew, Moran said. The Navy has lost confidence in those sailors.\n\nCollisions should never happen, Moran said. \"We got it wrong.\"\n\nA \"loud noise\" roused some of the sailors in the Fitzgerald's Berthing 2 compartment, the accident report said. Some in the ship's sleeping and living quarters \"felt an unusual movement,\" while others slept through the initial crash.\n\nSeconds after the ACX Crystal plowed into the starboard side of the Navy's guided missile destroyer at 1:30 a.m., on June 17, seawater gushed through a 13-foot-by-17-foot gash, knocking some from their beds and threatening to drown all 35 sailors in the compartment.\n\n\"Water on deck!\" sailors shouted. \"Get out!\"\n\nThe harrowing moments and hours after the collision -- and the heroism that saved the lives of all but seven of the 35 sailors in Berthing 2 -- are recounted in the report.\n\nIt details the frantic efforts to account for all the sailors in the darkened, flooding compartment, keep the ship afloat, and rescue the ship's commander who dangled outside his crumpled cabin.\n\n\"The crew of the Fitzgerald fought hard in the dark of night to save their ship,\" wrote Rear Adm. C.F. Williams, commander of Carrier Strike Group Five. Williams' preliminary report looks at the injuries and deaths that resulted from the crash.\n\nThe Fitzgerald, with a crew of about 300 sailors, was about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan, at the time of the collision. The sea was calm, and the moon shone through broken clouds. The ship was dark but for navigation lights, and red bulbs inside.\n\nThe Crystal is a far larger ship at 728 feet and 29,000 tons, compared with the Fitzgerald's 505 feet and 9,000 tons. The port side of the Crystal's bow slammed into the Fitzgerald above the waterline, and the bulb-like bow below the surface crunched into the Fitzgerald near Berthing 2.\n\nFlooding in Berthing 2\n\nBerthing 2 held 42 beds in stacks of three bunks, a bathroom, and a lounge area. It contained a lounge with sofas, chairs and a television. After the collision, \"nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly.\"\n\nThe Fitzgerald rocked violently, settling into a 7-degree list to her starboard side.\n\n\"One sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water,\" according to the report. \"Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up.\"\n\nWithin a minute, the compartment had flooded and the water rose. Mattresses, furniture and an exercise bike floated in the aisles. The tilting ship complicated the escape, and the water was neck high by the time many had reached the ladder to climb to safety.\n\nAs the water forced them to the top of the stairs, two sailors reached into the dark water and fished two more shipmates out.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The captain of a Navy warship that lost seven sailors in a collision with a commercial container ship in June will be relieved of command and nearly a dozen others face punishment, the Navy's second-ranking admiral said Thursday.\n\nAdm. William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed.

Bill Moran, the deputy chief of naval operations, said that Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin relieved Cmdr. Bryce Benson for cause after a report detailing the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and the freighter ACX Crystal was released by the Navy.\n\nThe ship's entire leadership, Moran said, will be relieved, and about a dozen sailors face punishment, including all of the destroyer's watch.\n\nThe command team of three have been relieved. About nine others face non-judicial punishment.\n\nFurther sanctions are possible, Moran said.\n\nAucoin acted swiftly because the investigation indicated serious mistakes were made by the crew, Moran said. The Navy has lost confidence in those sailors.\n\nA \"loud noise\" roused some of the sailors in the Fitzgerald's Berthing 2 compartment, the accident report said. Some in the ship's sleeping and living quarters \"felt an unusual movement,\" while others slept through the initial crash.\n\nSeconds after the ACX Crystal plowed into the starboard side of the Navy's guided missile destroyer at 1:30 a.m., on June 17, seawater gushed through a 13-foot-by-17-foot gash, knocking some from their beds and threatening to drown all 35 sailors in the compartment.\n\n\"Water on deck!\" sailors shouted. \"Get out!\"\n\nThe harrowing moments and hours after the collision -- and the heroism that saved the lives of all but seven of the 35 sailors in Berthing 2 -- are recounted in the report.\n\nIt details the frantic efforts to account for all the sailors in the darkened, flooding compartment, keep the ship afloat, and rescue the ship's commander who dangled outside his crumpled cabin.\n\n\"The crew of the Fitzgerald fought hard in the dark of night to save their ship,\" wrote Rear Adm. C.F. Williams, commander of Carrier Strike Group Five. Williams' preliminary report looks at the injuries and deaths that resulted from the crash.\n\nThe Fitzgerald, with a crew of about 300 sailors, was about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan, at the time of the collision. The sea was calm, and the moon shone through broken clouds. The ship was dark but for navigation lights, and red bulbs inside.\n\nThe Crystal is a far larger ship at 728 feet and 29,000 tons, compared with the Fitzgerald's 505 feet and 9,000 tons. The port side of the Crystal's bow slammed into the Fitzgerald above the waterline, and the bulb-like bow below the surface crunched into the Fitzgerald near Berthing 2.\n\nFlooding in Berthing 2\n\nBerthing 2 held 42 beds in stacks of three bunks, a bathroom, and a lounge area. It contained a lounge with sofas, chairs and a television. After the collision, \"nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly.\"\n\nThe Fitzgerald rocked violently, settling into a 7-degree list to her starboard side.\n\n\"One sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water,\" according to the report. \"Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up.\"\n\nWithin a minute, the compartment had flooded and the water rose. Mattresses, furniture and an exercise bike floated in the aisles. The tilting ship complicated the escape, and the water was neck high by the time many had reached the ladder to climb to safety.\n\nAs the water forced them to the top of the stairs, two sailors reached into the dark water and fished two more shipmates out. The last rescued sailor had been in the bathroom at the time of the crash. The sailors \"pulled him from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported he was taking is final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nThe seven sailors who drowned were nearest the gash, \"directly in the path of the onrushing water.\"\n\n\u00a9 2017 USATODAY.COM\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302691", "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304095", "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304415", "label": {"eng": "Red"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "306536", "label": {"eng": "Tweet (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309685", "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309837", "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "314238", "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319582", "label": {"eng": "C (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "324732", "label": {"eng": "Stairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326820", "label": {"eng": "Bulb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334052", "label": {"eng": "Waterline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341960", "label": {"eng": "Rear admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "342575", "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moran_(catcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "850481", "label": {"eng": "Bill Moran (catcher)"}}]}

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nFILE- This June 17, 2017 file photo shows the damaged USS Fitzgerald near the U.S. Naval base in Yokosuka, southwest of Tokyo. The Navy says the commanding officer of a warship that lost seven sailors in a collision off the coast of Japan will be relieved of command, and nearly a dozen other sailors face punishment. Adm. William Moran, the No. 2 Navy officer, told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday, Aug. 17, that the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko, File)\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nHer work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama\n\nFILE- In this Sept. 10, 2016, file photo.

But after preliminary excavations it was covered up.\n\nHowever a survey by Historic England last summer revealed the ship was in danger of being destroyed by an invasive ship worm, which is moving to British coastlines from the Mediterranean.\n\nThe shifting and treacherous Goodwin Sands has also left the hull exposed to salt water and air, meaning that archaeologists have had to act fast to record or bring up endangered timbers, canons and artefacts.\n\nNot only have the new excavations uncovered three wooden treasure chests, believed to contain a fortune in silver ingots bound for the East Indies, but for the first time bones of the victims have been found among the wreck.\n\nLittle is known about the crew and passengers of the Rooswijk. As well as sailors, there would have been soldiers protecting the precious cargo, children, wives, and even 'guests of the lower decks' - a polite term for prostitutes. Around 250 people in total were on board when the ship sank and it is thought none survived.\n\nPersonal items of everyday life, including leather shoes, knives, belt buckles and pewter jugs were also recovered from the ship.\n\nMark Dunkley, a marine archaeologist for Historic England, said: \"With the finds that we're bringing up we're seeing how they lived on board, and now with the remains we are seeing how they died as well. They were probably drowned or crushed as the ships collapsed or the cannons came loose and rolled across the decks.\n\n\"We have started finding and recovering bodies. It's a highly significant assemblage because it is so rare to find a lost crew on a shipwreck, captured in time at the moment when a catastrophe happened. In that sense its like an underwater Pompeii.\"\n\nThe team is planning to take DNA samples of the bones to find out whether any of the victims have descendants who are still alive today, as well as X-raying the mysterious seamen's chests to find what treasure lies within, before they are opened up\n\nHowever in the shorter term archaeologists are battling against time, and the elements, to conserve the site from a damaging invader before it is lost forever.\n\n\"The ship is threatened by a new type of ship worm which has come from the Mediterranean Sea and is moving north because the sea around Britain is getting warmer with climate change,\" added Mr Dunkley.\n\n\"It's reached as far north as Felixstowe so any shipwreck below that latitude is threatened by it. It burrows into any wood which speeds up decay and makes the wrecks vulnerable. It attacks the timbers and wooden chests. So it's important that we start conserving these things now to prevent any more damage.\"\n\nThe Rooswijk was owned by the Dutch East India Company and was bound for Jakarta to trade silver and copper for pepper, nutmeg and porcelain when it sank.\n\nSoon after the ship foundered a chest containing letters washed up at Deal in Kent, which identified the captain as Daniel Rousiers, and named around a dozen other crew. But the identities of the rest of the victims were lost in time.\n\nNow a protected wreck site the ships remains are owned by the Dutch government and managed by Historic England on behalf of the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Most of the finds, and ingots, will be returned to The Netherlands, although archaeologists are hoping to put some of the treasures on display in Britain.\n\nJohn Glen, Minister for Arts, Heritage and Tourism, said: \"The shipwrecks around our coastline are amazing snapshots of Europe's seafaring and naval history and it is important that we study them while we can.\n\n\"The Rooswijk excavation will help recover and preserve extraordinary artefacts.\"\n\nAround 2,000 ships are known to be wrecked off Goodwin Sands and the shifting landscape mean they are often uncovered by storms or high tides.\n\nMartijn Manders, Project Leader of the Rooswijk Excavation and Maritime Heritage Programme Manager at the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands said: \"The Goodwin sands has been a treacherous place for ships throughout the centuries and is now a treasure trove for archaeologists.\n\n\"The rapidly shifting sands means that the site is even more exposed now than it was during our initial dives to assess the condition of the Rooswijk last year. This makes the excavation urgent.\"\n\nHistoric England will be holding open days to view finds from the ship between August 19 and September 16.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri":

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the June collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed.

They are the commanding officer, Commander Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Commander Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Admiral Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership\". Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Commander Clay Doss said on Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness\", which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nCrew of US destroyer were likely at fault for collision with cargo ship\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates.

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed.

Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion.

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the June collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n-- -- --\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311843", "label": {"eng": "Territorial waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "368243", "label": {"eng": "Seamanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "383354", "label": {"eng": "Stationary bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "709530", "label": {"eng": "Command master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

The death of the seven sailors was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. warship since 2000, when Islamic extremists bombed the USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbor.\n\nThe report said the collision at 1:30 a.m. local time sent water pouring into the U.S. warship.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nWithin 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nThe commanding officer, Bryce Benson, who is one of the officers who will be relieved of his post, was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the June collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302885", "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "368243", "label": {"eng": "Seamanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

The death of the seven sailors was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. warship since 2000, when Islamic extremists bombed the USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbour.\n\nThe report said the collision at 1:30 a.m. local time sent water pouring into the U.S. warship.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nWithin 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nThe commanding officer, Bryce Benson, who is one of the officers who will be relieved of his post, was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali;

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the June collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nHer work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

The death of the seven sailors was the greatest loss of life on a US warship since 2000, when Islamic extremists bombed the USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbor.\n\nThe report said the collision at 1:30 a.m. local time sent water pouring into the US warship.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nWithin 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2,

was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nGet latest

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the June collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nHer work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302885", "label": {"eng": "Bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303604", "label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "368243", "label": {"eng": "Seamanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

The death of the seven sailors was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. warship since 2000, when Islamic extremists bombed the USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbour.\n\nThe report said the collision at 1:30 a.m. local time sent water pouring into the U.S. warship.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nWithin 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nThe commanding officer, Bryce Benson, who is one of the officers who will be relieved of his post, was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\n(This

All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nCmdr. Doss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Adm. Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nMr. Yoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "368243", "label": {"eng": "Seamanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "709530", "label": {"eng": "Command master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters Thursday that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable, and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship,\" the Navy's 7th Fleet said in a statement, noting that \"flawed\" teamwork among those assigned to keep watch contributed to the collision.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nThe Navy said the three had shown \"inadequate leadership.\" Separately, seven junior officers were relieved of their duties because they had shown \"poor seamanship\" and bad teamwork, 7th Fleet spokesman Cmdr. Clay Doss said Friday.\n\nAdministrative penalties were handed out to seven others that were members of the watch teams, he said, without giving details. All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nHer work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama\n\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Admiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told reporters the ship's commanding officer, executive officer and master chief petty officer would be removed from the vessel because \"we've lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead.\"\n\nMoran said that in total close to a dozen sailors would face administrative punishment and left open the possibility for further action. Multiple US and Japanese investigations are underway into how the USS Fitzgerald, a guided missile destroyer, and the much larger ACX Crystal container ship collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay in the early hours of June 17.\n\nThe Navy also released a report that provided new details of the crash and its aftermath. The collision tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline, killing seven sailors in what was the greatest loss of life on a US Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000. The report said the collision at 1:30 am local time sent water pouring into the US warship. \"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nWithin 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision. \"Lockers were floating past him... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape. \"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report says.\n\nThe commanding officer was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door. \"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said. The sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued the commanding officer, who by this point was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped.

Among those being disciplined from the crew of the USS Fitzgerald are its commanding officer, executive officer and senior enlisted sailor, who will all be relieved of their duties aboard the ship, said Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of naval operations. \"They will be detached from the ship for cause, which (means) we've lost trust and confidence for their ability to lead in those positions and they will not return to the ship,\" Moran told reporters.\n\nSeven sailors drowned in their sleeping berth when the USS Fitzgerald collided with the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal in a busy shipping channel off Japan's coast early on June 17. Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, who heads the Navy's 7th Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan has notified one sailor of his or her punishment and the rest would likely be informed by today. About a dozen sailors are expected to be disciplined in total. \"If it's clear to (Aucoin) that some members of that crew should no longer be doing this line of work, it's time to move them on, it's time to take accountability actions,\" Moran said. Moran said the sailors could face further punishments later one, depending on the outcome of various ongoing probes. \"I'm not telling they will or they won't. It's just we are not done with the investigation,\" Moran said.\n\nAged 19 to 37, the drowned seamen were found by divers in flooded sleeping quarters a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald. Moran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into what happened in the immediate aftermath of the crash. The report found that all seven victims died in the line of duty and their deaths were not due to any misconduct on their part. Investigators praised the quick-thinking and \"heroic\" actions of sailors who worked to save shipmates, one of whom had to be dragged from his bunk in a flooding sleeping area as waters quickly rose. One sailor who was rescued moments before he would have drowned reported that \"when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\" Additionally, the report describes how the ship's commanding officer was injured when the merchant ship Crystal struck his cabin, trapping him inside.

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cSerious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe bridge team,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \u00e2\u0080\u009clost situational awareness,\u00e2\u0080\u009d which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space \u00e2\u0080\" actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the review said.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAt least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d it said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "341961", "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "462006", "label": {"eng": "Robert Burns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "709530", "label": {"eng": "Command master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision,\" the US Seventh Fleet said in a media release.\n\nIn the first detailed account from one of those directly involved in the collision in the early hours of June 17, the captain of the cargo ship the ACX Crystal said in a report seen by Reuters his crew signalled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights around 10 minutes before the collision. The Fitzgerald did not respond or alter course, it said.\n\nThe commercial vessel had the right-of-way under maritime rules and the Fitzgerald, which was hit on the starboard side, was likely at fault.\n\nSeveral US and Japanese investigations are still under way into how the Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay.\n\nOne pertinent question, said two naval officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, is what was happening at the time in the Fitzgerald's Combat Information Center, where crew members monitor radar that should have detected the approach of a 30,000-ton cargo vessel.\n\nCommander Bryce Benson was relieved \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead\", the Seventh Fleet said.\n\nCommander Sean Babbitt and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin \"contributed to the lack of watch stander preparedness and readiness that was evident in the events leading up to the collision\", it said.\n\nSeveral other junior officers have also been relieved, with administrative action taken against other members of the ship's watch teams.\n\n\"Serious mistakes\"\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told a media briefing earlier in Washington that about nine sailors would face administrative punishments.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew, and there was no benefit to waiting on taking accountability actions,\" Moran said.\n\nAn official report released on Thursday contained dramatic accounts of what happened when the freighter hit the Fitzgerald.\n\nThe collision, at 1:30 a.m. local time, tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline and sent water pouring into the warship, the report said.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing area started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture, and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nThe berthing was completely flooded within 60 seconds, although more than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nBenson was trapped in his cabin and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves to each other with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

All 14 remain in the Navy, but they will be assigned to other jobs, he said.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed, but enough details were available to decide on Friday's actions, the Navy said.\n\nDoss said the specifics of what led to the collision were related to preparations for litigation and cannot be released.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing.\n\nHe said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nWithin 30 to 60 seconds, the berthing was flooded, and the water was waist deep, the study said. Mattresses, furniture, an exercise bicycle were floating in the aisles.\n\nThe sailors tried to escape and helped each other, looking for their mates. One sailor got pinned between floating lockers and was barely able to pull himself free. The seven sailors who died were sleeping in the area closest to and directly in the path of the incoming water, the study found.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nThe Japanese and U.S. coast guards are conducting their own investigations.\n\nJapan's Coast Guard is \"not in a position to make any comments on the Navy's investigation,\" spokesman Yoshihito Nakamura said.\n\nYoshinori Fukushima, spokesman for the operators of the container ship ACX Crystal, also declined to comment, saying they had yet to see the Navy report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\nFollow her on Twitter at https://twitter.com/yurikageyama\n\nHer work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303604", "label": {"eng": "Coast guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311843", "label": {"eng": "Territorial waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "id": "322550", "label": {"eng": "United States Coast Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "368243", "label": {"eng": "Seamanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_bicycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "383354", "label": {"eng": "Stationary bicycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "709530", "label": {"eng": "Command master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

Toru Hanai/Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - About a dozen US sailors are expected to face punishment for a collision in June between the USS Fitzgerald and a Philippines cargo ship, including the warship's commanding officer and other senior leaders of the ship, the Navy said on Thursday.\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told reporters the ship's commanding officer, executive officer and master chief petty officer would be removed from the vessel because \"we've lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead.\"\n\nMoran said that in total close to a dozen sailors would face administrative punishment and left open the possibility for further action.\n\nMultiple US and Japanese investigations are under way into how the USS Fitzgerald, a guided missile destroyer, and the much larger ACX Crystal container ship collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay in the early hours of June 17.\n\nThe collision tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline, killing seven sailors in what was the greatest loss of life on a US Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000.\n\nThe report said the collision at 1:30 am local time sent water pouring into the US warship.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nWithin 60 seconds, the berthing was completely flooded. More than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report says.\n\nThe commanding officer was trapped in his cabin, and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves together with a belt and rescued the commanding officer, who by this point was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali;

Sean Babbitt and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin \"contributed to the lack of watch stander preparedness and readiness that was evident in the events leading up to the collision\".\n\nSeveral other junior officers have also been relieved, with administrative action taken against other members of the ship's watch teams.\n\nMultiple investigations have yet to apportion blame for the accident that killed seven U.S. sailors aboard the guided missile destroyer the USS Fitzgerald.\n\nHowever, the punishments are the first public admission by the U.S. Navy that mistakes by the crew contributed to the deadliest incident on a U.S. warship since Islamist extremists bombed the USS Cole in Yemen's Aden harbor in 2000.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship. Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision,\" the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a statement.\n\nIn the first detailed account from one of those directly involved in the collision in the early hours of June 17, the captain of the cargo ship the ACX Crystal said in a report seen by Reuters his crew signaled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights around 10 minutes before the collision.\n\nIn the report, the captain said the Fitzgerald did not respond or alter course.\n\nThe commercial vessel had the right-of-way under maritime rules and the Fitzgerald, which was hit on the starboard side, was likely at fault.\n\nSeveral U.S. and Japanese investigations are still under way into how the Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay.\n\nOne pertinent question, said two naval officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, is what was happening at the time in the Fitzgerald's Combat Information Center, where crew members monitor radar that should have detected the approach of a 30,000-ton cargo vessel.\n\nAdm. Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told a media briefing earlier in Washington that about nine sailors would face administrative punishments.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew, and there was no benefit to waiting on taking accountability actions,\" Moran said.\n\nAn official report released on Thursday contained dramatic accounts of what happened when the freighter hit the Fitzgerald.\n\nThe collision, at 1:30 a.m. local time, tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline and sent water pouring into the warship, the report said.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing area started yelling.\n\n\"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture, and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nThe berthing was completely flooded within 60 seconds, although more than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped.\n\nThe last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing II, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nBenson was trapped in his cabin and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves to each other with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories":

It's just we are not done with the investigation,\" Moran said.\n\n- 'Heroic' actions -\n\nAged 19 to 37, the drowned seamen were found by divers in flooded sleeping quarters a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald.\n\nMoran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into what happened in the immediate aftermath of the crash.\n\nThe report found that all seven victims died in the line of duty and their deaths were not due to any misconduct on their part.\n\nInvestigators praised the quick-thinking and \"heroic\" actions of sailors who worked to save shipmates, one of whom had to be dragged from his bunk in a flooding sleeping area as waters quickly rose.\n\nOne sailor who was rescued moments before he would have drowned reported that \"when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nAdditionally, the report describes how the ship's commanding officer was injured when the merchant ship Crystal struck his cabin, trapping him inside.\n\nFellow sailors had to smash and pry his door open before retrieving the commander, who was \"hanging from the side of the ship. The officer was eventually medically evacuated by helicopter.\n\nMoran praised the actions of the drowned sailors.

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space -- actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.\n\nPolitical Fix from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch\n\nBe informed.

Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision,\" the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a statement.\n\nIn the first detailed account from one of those directly involved in the collision in the early hours of June 17, the captain of the cargo ship the ACX Crystal said in a report seen by Reuters his crew signalled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights around 10 minutes before the collision.\n\nIn the report, the captain said the Fitzgerald did not respond or alter course.\n\nThe commercial vessel had the right-of-way under maritime rules and the Fitzgerald, which was hit on the starboard side, was likely at fault.\n\nSeveral U.S. and Japanese investigations are still under way into how the Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay.\n\nOne pertinent question, said two naval officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, is what was happening at the time in the Fitzgerald's Combat Information Center, where crew members monitor radar that should have detected the approach of a 30,000-ton cargo vessel.\n\nBill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told a media briefing earlier in Washington that about nine sailors would face administrative punishments.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew, and there was no benefit to waiting on taking accountability actions,\" Moran said.\n\nAn official report released on Thursday contained dramatic accounts of what happened when the freighter hit the Fitzgerald.\n\nThe collision, at 1:30 a.m. local time, tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline and sent water pouring into the warship, the report said.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing area started yelling.\n\n\"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture, and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nThe berthing was completely flooded within 60 seconds, although more than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped.\n\nThe last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing II, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nBenson was trapped in his cabin and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves to each other with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision,\" the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a media release.\n\nIn the first detailed account from one of those directly involved in the collision in the early hours of June 17, the captain of the cargo ship the ACX Crystal said in a report seen by Reuters his crew signalled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights around 10 minutes before the collision. The Fitzgerald did not respond or alter course, it said.\n\nThe commercial vessel had the right-of-way under maritime rules and the Fitzgerald, which was hit on the starboard side, was likely at fault.\n\nSeveral U.S. and Japanese investigations are still under way into how the Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay.\n\nOne pertinent question, said two naval officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, is what was happening at the time in the Fitzgerald's Combat Information Center, where crew members monitor radar that should have detected the approach of a 30,000-ton cargo vessel.\n\nCommander Bryce Benson was relieved \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead\", the Seventh Fleet said.\n\nCommander Sean Babbitt and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin \"contributed to the lack of watch stander preparedness and readiness that was evident in the events leading up to the collision\", it said.\n\nSeveral other junior officers have also been relieved, with administrative action taken against other members of the ship's watch teams.\n\n\"SERIOUS MISTAKES\"\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told a media briefing earlier in Washington that about nine sailors would face administrative punishments.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew, and there was no benefit to waiting on taking accountability actions,\" Moran said.\n\nAn official report released on Thursday contained dramatic accounts of what happened when the freighter hit the Fitzgerald.\n\nThe collision, at 1:30 a.m. local time, tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline and sent water pouring into the warship, the report said.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing area started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture, and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nThe berthing was completely flooded within 60 seconds, although more than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nBenson was trapped in his cabin and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves to each other with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\n(Reporting by Idrees Ali in WASHINGTON and Tim Kelly in TOKYO;

Among those being disciplined from the crew of the USS Fitzgerald are its commanding officer, executive officer and senior enlisted sailor, who will all be relieved of their duties aboard the ship, said Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of naval operations.\n\n\"They will be detached from the ship for cause, which (means) we've lost trust and confidence for their ability to lead in those positions and they will not return to the ship,\" Moran told reporters. Seven sailors drowned in their sleeping berth when the USS Fitzgerald collided with the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal in a busy shipping channel off Japan's coast early on June 17. Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin, who heads the Navy's 7th Fleet, based in Yokosuka, Japan has notified one sailor of his or her punishment and the rest would likely be informed bytoday. About a dozen sailors are expected to be disciplined in total.\n\n\"If it's clear to (Aucoin) that some members of that crew should no longer be doing this line of work, it's time to move them on, it's time to take accountability actions,\" Moran said. Moran said the sailors could face further punishments later one, depending on the outcome of various ongoing probes. \"I'm not telling they will or they won't. It's just we are not done with the investigation,\" Moran said. Aged 19 to 37, the drowned seamen were found by divers in flooded sleeping quarters a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald. Moran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into whathappened in the immediate aftermath of the crash.\n\nThe report found that all seven victims died in the line of duty and their deaths were not due to any misconduct on their part. Investigators praised the quick-thinking and \"heroic\"actions of sailors who worked to save shipmates, one of whom had to be dragged from his bunk in a flooding sleeping area as waters quickly rose. One sailor who was rescued moments before he would have drowned reported that \"when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nAdditionally, the report describes how the ship's commanding officer was injured when the merchant ship Crystal struck his cabin, trapping him inside.

The Fitzgerald did not respond or alter course, it said..\n\nThe commercial vessel had the right-of-way under maritime rules and the Fitzgerald, which was hit on the starboard side, was likely at fault.\n\nSeveral U.S. and Japanese investigations are still under way into how the Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay.\n\nOne pertinent question, said two naval officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, is what was happening at the time in the Fitzgerald's Combat Information Center, where crew members monitor radar that should have detected the approach of a 30,000-ton cargo vessel.\n\nCommander Bryce Benson was relieved \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead\", the Seventh Fleet said.\n\nCommander Sean Babbitt and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin \"contributed to the lack of watch stander preparedness and readiness that was evident in the events leading up to the collision\", it said.\n\nSeveral other junior officers have also been relieved, with administrative action taken against other members of the ship's watch teams.\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told a media briefing earlier in Washington that about nine sailors would face administrative punishments.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew, and there was no benefit to waiting on taking accountability actions,\" Moran said.\n\nAn official report released on Thursday contained dramatic accounts of what happened when the freighter hit the Fitzgerald.\n\nThe collision, at 1:30 a.m. local time, tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline and sent water pouring into the warship, the report said.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing area started yelling.\"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture, and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nThe berthing was completely flooded within 60 seconds, although more than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nBenson was trapped in his cabin and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves to each other with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2017.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

It will take months of conservation work before the archaeologists discover whether it holds some of the silver treasure the ship was carrying, or a long dead sailor's old socks.\n\nA joint excavation by divers and scientists from Historic England and the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands is gradually unravelling the story of the last hours of the Rooswijk, which ran aground and sank in the Goodwin Sands off Kent in January 1740 with the loss of every life on board - almost 250 sailors, soldiers and passengers.\n\nFinds already brought ashore in Ramsgate include a shoe still showing the dint of the sailor's heel on the instep, glass bottles and a fancy wine glass with an air twist stem, which must have come from the captain's cabin, pewter jugs, an onion jar, tiles from the cooking stove still scorched by the last meal, three wooden chests, one human thigh bone - and some genuine old-fashioned treasure in the form of beautiful Mexican silver dollars, minted just a few years before the wreck, and older, cruder chopped-up pieces of eight.\n\nSeveral cannon and two huge sea anchors still lie in the silt on the seabed.\n\nA quantity of silver was salvaged in 2005 and returned to the Dutch government, which still owns the wreck, but the project leader, Martijn Martens, maritime cultural heritage manager at the Netherlands agency, said they had no idea how much silver was actually on board.\n\n\"We have many questions,\" Martens said. \"We do not even know what this ship really looked like.\"\n\nThe ship was bound for Jakarta to buy spices and porcelain, and was carrying quantities of silver bullion and ingots, but silver was worth far more in the East Indies than in Amsterdam, and smuggling - at every level, from a chestful in an officer's cabin to a few coins stitched into a sailor's belt - was a well-known way of supplementing wages.\n\nThe first finds of silver scattered in small quantities throughout the wreckage are bearing this out, and also show that those who couldn't afford silver were bringing any kind of scrap metal they could lay hands on, knowing it would all have a value at their destination.\n\nIn 1740 it was months before anyone wondered what had happened to the Rooswijk, and it was only when the ship failed to make landfall at the Cape of Good Hope, after what should have been months at sea, that the company began to worry. A chest of letters washed up on the English coast revealed the truth: the ship, only a few years old and on her second voyage, having left Amsterdam on 7 January, had been driven by a storm the next day on to the Goodwin, the dreaded Ship Swallower, which has claimed the lives of thousands of seafarers - a 19th-century steam ship lies on the seabed 100 metres from the 18th-century three-master. The evidence from the wreck site is that the heavily laden ship sank like a stone, with the loss of everyone on board.\n\nThe ship is an officially protected wreck site because of its historic importance. Of the 250 Dutch East India ships known to have been wrecked, only a third have been located and this is the first to be scientifically excavated.\n\nThe excavation was judged urgent because the deep silty sand that has protected the remains for so long is shifting now due to changing tidal patterns, leaving timbers exposed and decaying - and vulnerable to treasure hunters.\n\nIt may never be possible, or even desirable, to open the mystery chest. Conventional x-rays often don't reveal much of heavily concreted objects. Angela Middleton, a conservation expert at Historic England, hopes to persuade the customs authorities to bring along one of the scanners they use at the port to check for people and goods hidden in lorries, and see if it shows up anything.\n\n\"We might find out it is impossible to open the chest without destroying it. Or we might find out what is in it and decide it's just not worth even trying to open it,\" she said.\n\nManders described the Goodwin Sands as \" a treasure trove for archaeologists\". There have been protests over plans by the Dover port authority to dredge there to improve the shipping channel and also extract sand and gravel for docks development work. The sands also became the last resting place of many downed Battle of Britain air crew, and others lost in the second world war. Sir Mark Rylance, who starred in the recent blockbuster film Dunkirk, described the proposal as disrespectful and insensitive.\n\nAlison James, a maritime archaeologist at Historic England, said they were in discussions with Dover, and though the Rooswijk lies some distance from the proposed dredging area, they would be monitoring carefully its condition and the other protected wrecks.\n\nThere will be open days where the public can see many of the finds at the excavation's warehouse base in Ramsgate Marina on 19 August and 16 September.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

It attacks the timbers and wooden chests.\n\n'So it's important that we start conserving these things now to prevent any more damage.'\n\nLittle is known about the crew of the ship, skippered by Daniel Rousiers, which first sailed to what was then Batavia - modern day Indonesia - in 1737.\n\nTo recover objects (pictured), the team use a machine to carefully suck up the sand from the site, revealing buried artefacts.\n\nIt sank on the second day of its second voyage in 1740.\n\nTo recover objects, the team use a machine to carefully suck up the sand from the site, revealing buried artefacts.\n\nThree large chests have been recovered from the current excavation which may contain bullion.\n\nThe archaeologists will carefully open the chests slowly after they are X-rayed to discover what is inside, to ensure nothing might be inadvertently damaged in the process.\n\nThe divers have also recovered spoons, shoes, belt buckles, pipes, pewter tankards, glassware, ornate knife handles, and musket balls.\n\nSeveral cannons are still on the sea bed.\n\nSeveral silver 'Pillar dollars' - minted in Mexico - have been found on the ship along with silver pieces of eight.\n\nThe research team believe that some of the silver was being smuggled by sailors for their own personal trade.\n\nThe items recovered from the sea are being stored in fresh water and will be on display to the public in Ramsgate.\n\nThree large chests have been recovered from the current excavation which may contain bullion.

He said: 'Our last survey was last year when more material was exposed than ever before.'\n\nThe research team believe that some of the silver was being smuggled by sailors for their own personal trade.

how that person died.\n\n'Here we know everyone drowned or were crushed prior to drowning.'\n\nIn 2004, diver Ken Welling visited the wreck, and retrieved two complete chests and hundreds of silver bars.\n\nSeveral hundred Mexican silver cobs of the 1720s and early 1730s, and transitional 'klippes' that date to around 1733 have been recovered.\n\nHundreds more 'pillar dollars' have also been discovered and sold at auction.\n\nAs well as wrecked ships, in 2000 a crashed German Dornier Do-17 Z bomber, downed in 1940 during World War II was recovered from the sands.\n\nThis image shows a

William Moran told reporters at the Pentagon late Thursday.Moran added that the commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, Adm. Joseph Aucoin, \"has notified them of his intent\" to detach them for cause a move likely to occur during their non-judicial punishment process, scheduled to take place Friday.While the final investigation into the collision is ongoing, Moran said: \"We do not have to have the investigation complete to start the process.\"The Fitzgerald's commanding officer, Cdr. Bryce Benson, and the executive officer, Cdr. Sean Babbiit, were both sleeping, and the master chief petty officer, Brice Baldwin, was not on the bridge at the time of collision.Read MoreThe bow of the cargo ship directly struck the commander's cabin, according to the Navy's report detailing the immediate aftermath of the collision.It said Benson \"was hanging from the side of the ship\" when he was retrieved by crewmembers who were forced to use a sledgehammer, kettlebell and their bodies to break through the door and gain access to the heavily damaged cabin.Benson was medically evacuated via helicopter due to the severity of his injuries and he placed on limited duty status on July 11.\"There are a lot of sailors\" who have undergone the non-judicial punishment process and \"survived and done well,\" Moran said, but \"when you look at what happened here, it's going to be pretty hard to recover from this.\"While additional non-judicial punishments could be levied at the \"captain's mast\" inquiry, due to take place Friday, Moran said that Aucoin \"has already made the decision to detach for cause\" the leadership team.\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that \"clearly at some point the bridge team lost situational awareness.\"One additional sailor has already undergone the captain's mast. Several other sailors are due to go through the process, including the people who were on watch that night.The Navy also plans to review its training and qualification procedures in the wake of the deadly collision, in which the Fitzgerald was heavily damaged. It will have to be brought back to the US for repairs.The Navy's report on the immediate aftermath provides a harrowing account of US sailors attempting to escape a rapidly flooding sleeping area that filled with water within minutes after the cargo ship's bow tore a hole in the side of the Fitzgerald. Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died.The report describes a chaotic scene following the collision between the Fitzgerald and the much larger cargo ship. Some sailors were thrown from their beds, while others remained asleep. Sailors ran through the sleeping area, attempting to awaken their still-sleeping crew members.\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" the report said, referring to the Naval term for a bed.The crew had to move quickly to escape the area using a ladder before the sleeping area became completely flooded, with the report saying the room \"was nearly flooded within a span of 30 to 60 seconds.\"\"By the time the third sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep,\" the report said.Rear Adm. Charles F. Williams wrote in the memo accompanying the report that the sailors in that sleeping area \"should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced.\"Moran said the investigation will have to be completed before any medals or awards can be adjudicated to any sailors for acts of heroism. An acting commanding officer had been assigned to the Fitzgerald following the collision, and a permanent replacement, Cdr. Garrett Miller, has been identified and is expected to take command soon.The full investigation will have to be completed in order for the Navy to assign responsibility for the collision.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "304269", "label": {"eng": "Cnn.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Messenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308970", "label": {"eng": "Facebook Messenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "341960", "label": {"eng": "Rear admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "343304", "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlebell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "369480", "label": {"eng": "Kettlebell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._Moran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "856026", "label": {"eng": "William L.

They include the two top officers, who will be relieved of duty.\n\nThe disciplinary measures were announced as the Navy released a harrowing preliminary report on the collision between the destroyer USS Fitzgerald and a freighter that killed seven people aboard the US ship. It was one of the Navy's deadliest accidents in years.\n\nThe ship's captain, Cmdr Bryce Benson; his second in command; the senior enlisted sailor and all those on watch the night of June 17 will face potentially career-killing administrative punishments that are expected to be doled out on Friday by the head of the Navy's 7th Fleet in Japan, Vice Adm Joseph P Aucoin.\n\nThe report described in detail the moments after the collision and the rescue efforts aboard the ship.\n\nDozens of sailors who were rocked from their slumber, the report said, raced in the dark to escape from their flooding quarters. Within 90 seconds, seawater rushing through a gaping hole in the starboard hull was at first waist deep, then neck high as sailors pushed aside mattresses, wall lockers and other floating debris to clamber up a ladder to safety. The last sailor pulled from the chaos was underwater when his shipmates yanked him up.\n\nThe freighter crashed directly into Cmdr Benson's stateroom, ripping open a huge hole and trapping him inside. It took five sailors, using a sledgehammer and kettlebell, 25 minutes to break down the door to his cabin to rescue the captain, who was seriously injured and hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nIn summing up the failures of the captain and his crew, the vice chief of naval operations, Adm Bill Moran, said the report made clear that \"serious mistakes were made by members of the crew.\" As the shipping lanes got more crowded that night, Adm Moran said the sailors on watch \"lost situational awareness,\" and by the time they realised their errors, it was too late to avoid a collision with the much larger freighter.\n\nWhat the report released on Thursday did not answer, and what is still under a separate ongoing investigation, is how the collision could have happened. Were lookouts on watch scanning the seas for other ships and, if so, why did they not see the 728-foot freighter, the ACX Crystal, stacked with more than 1,000 containers, bearing on the destroyer? How did radar officers on the bridge and in the combat information centre below fail to detect the freighter closing in? And why was Cmdr Benson not awakened and summoned to the bridge, as standard protocol requires, to ensure safe passage?\n\nAdm Moran said it could be weeks before the investigation is completed into the causes and culpability for the accident.\n\nCmdr Benson and the Fitzgerald's second-in-command, or executive officer, Cmdr Sean Babbitt, both of whom were asleep in their cabins when the ships collided, and the Fitzgerald's senior enlisted sailor, Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, were relieved of their duties aboard the Fitzgerald. Cmdr Benson, as well as several sailors on watch that night, will face what the military calls nonjudicial punishment.\n\nIn today's competitive Navy, the chances of these men being promoted with such black marks on their records is extremely remote.\n\nAdm Moran cautioned that as the investigation into the accident's cause proceeds, more sailors could face disciplinary action. It was not clear whether any crew members would face court-martial.\n\nThe report laid out a chilling scenario in which sailors were awakened suddenly by a loud noise and forced to evacuate amid fast-rising waters and in near-darkness.\n\nThe two ships that collided could not have been more different. The 9,000-ton, US$1.5 billion (S$2.05 billion) Fitzgerald, operating out of the Yokosuka naval base, was wrapping up a long day of training. The 29,000-ton Crystal, manned by a Filipino crew, is more than 200 feet longer than the Fitzgerald. It had been chartered by a Japanese company to take cargo from Nagoya, on Japan's central coast, to Tokyo. The Crystal was far less damaged than the Fitzgerald.\n\nWithin seconds of the collision, seawater poured through a 13-by-17-foot hole in the starboard hull, and the 505-foot Fitzgerald listed sharply to the starboard side. The ship radio room was damaged, and much of its communications gear ruined or left without power. Below decks, the crew was plunged into darkness except for red emergency lights.\n\nUS Navy ships and their crews train extensively for emergencies on board such as collisions and fires. Emergency crews responded immediately to reports of damage and trapped sailors across the ship.\n\nThe Fitzgerald had a crew of about 300 sailors, and the crisis focused on a sleeping compartment called Berthing 2, which has 42 beds in triple bunks spanning one side of the ship across to the other, two decks below the main deck.\n\nThe area also had a lounge filled with sofas, chairs, a table and a television set.\n\nOf the 42 sailors assigned to Berthing 2 at the time of collision, five were on watch and two were not aboard ship. Of the 35 remaining sailors in the crew area, 28 escaped the flooding and seven died.\n\nSome of the surviving sailors said they heard a loud noise at the time of impact. Others were thrown from their beds. Still others said they did not realise what happened and stayed in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\nWithin seconds, though, sailors were yelling, \"Water on deck! Get out!\" Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one had to be pulled from his bed and into the water before he woke up. Senior sailors checked for any who might still be in their beds.\n\nSailors told investigators that after the initial shock, they lined up calmly and walked several steps through the rushing water to climb a port side ladder and escape through a watertight hatch.\n\nBy the time the last group of sailors arrived at the bottom of the ladder, the water was up to their necks. Two sailors who had been helping others from the bottom of the ladder were eventually forced to climb the ladder as water reached the very top of the berthing compartment.\n\nOnce through the hatch, the sailors continued to search, reaching into the dark water to try to find anyone they could. From the top of the ladder, the two sailors pulled two others from the flooded compartment. Both of the rescued sailors were completely underwater when they were pulled to safety.\n\nThe last sailor to be pulled up from the murky darkness had been in the bathroom at the time of the collision and a flood of water knocked him to the floor. At one point he was pinned between the lockers floating past him and the compartment ceiling, but he was able to reach for a pipe on the ceiling to pull himself free. He made his way to the only light he could see, which was coming from the portside hatch.\n\nHe was swimming toward the hatch, the report said, \"when he was pulled from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported that when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nTwenty-seven sailors escaped Berthing 2 from the port side. One other sailor escaped from the starboard side.\n\nA Japanese coast guard helicopter lowered a rescue basket to lift the badly injured Cmdr Benson off the listing ship and whisk him to a Navy hospital in Yokosuka. Other US and Japanese military vessels and aircraft helped in the rescue effort.\n\nJust before 5am, with the flooding stabilised and operating under its own power, the Fitzgerald slowly started making its way back to port.\n\nThe next day, June 18, the bodies of the seven men who died were recovered by Navy divers from flooded spaces that had been sealed off to keep the ship from foundering, a wrenching decision by officers in the chaotic aftermath of the crash.

(U.S. Navy images)\n\nThe commander of the destroyer USS Fitzgerald and the executive officer have been permanently detached from the ship and face non-judicial punishment over the deadly collision in June with a container ship, the Navy announced Thursday.\n\nCmdr. Bryce Benson, commander of the Fitzgerald, and Cmdr. Sean Babbitt, the executive officer, are \"being detached for cause,\" meaning that the Navy \"has lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead,\" Adm. Bill Moran, Vice Chief of Naval Operations, said during a press conference.\n\nVice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, has also decided that the top enlisted sailor aboard the Fitzgerald and several other sailors on the watch crew at the time of the collision on June 17 will also face non-judicial punishment, Moran said.\n\nAucoin ruled that \"serious mistakes were made by the crew,\" Moran said.\n\nThe Fitzgerald was hit nearly broadside by the ACX Crystal cargo ship in the early morning hours of June 17 in Japanese waters. Seven sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer Fitzgerald were killed.\n\nThe service members, whose bodies were found in flooded berthing compartments, on Thursday were posthumously promoted.\n\nThe top enlisted sailor on the Fitzgerald was later identified as Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin. He, Benson and Babbitt were all in their berths when the collision occurred.\n\nHowever, Aucoin found that all three bore chief responsibility for the watch crew on the bridge losing \"situational awareness\" as the destroyer was proceeding at about 20 knots on a clear moonlit night in relatively calm seas, Moran said.\n\nWhen asked if the non-judicial punishment against Benson, Babbitt and Baldwin would be career ending, Moran said: \"Look at what happened here -- it's going to be pretty hard to recover from this.\" Moran said investigations were continuing but he declined to speculate on whether courts martial might be pursued against any of the Fitzgerald's crew.\n\nRelated content:\n\nSince the accident occurred, naval experts have pondered how a fast and agile destroyer carrying some of the world's most advanced radars and proceeding on a clear moonlit night in calm seas could have been hit nearly broadside by a slow and plodding cargo ship.\n\nThe speculation has centered on whether the bridge watch crew was either poorly trained or simply not alert. Moran said only that collisions should not happen in the U.S. Navy -- \"We got it wrong.\"\n\nA \"line of duty\" investigation released by the Navy earlier Thursday on actions following the collision gave evidence of the enormous damage inflicted on the Fitzgerald and the heroic actions of the crew in saving the ship and their fellow sailors.\n\nBerthing Area 2, two decks below the main deck where 35 sailors were sleeping in three-decker buns, was exposed to the open sea, the investigation said. The bulbous nose of the ACX Crystal had ripped a 13x17 foot hole into the side of the Fitzgerald.\n\n\"As a result, nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly,\" the investigation said. The seven sailors killed in the collision were all in Berthing 2. They were \"directly in the path of the onrushing water,\" the investigation said.\n\nThe force of the collision knocked the Fitzgerald into a 14-degree list to port before the ship rocked back violently into a seven-degree list to starboard. \"One sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water,\" the investigation said.\n\n\"Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" the investigation said.\n\nThe sailors were in water up to their necks as they scrambled to reach a ladder to safety.

Bill Moran, the deputy chief of naval operations, said that Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, head of the Navy's 7th Fleet, plans to relieve Cmdr. Bryce Benson for cause. On Thursday, the Navy released a preliminary report on the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and the freighter ACX Crystal off the coast of Japan.\n\nAbout a dozen sailors in all face some punishment, including all of the destroyer's watch. Further sanctions are possible, Moran said.\n\n\"Clearly at some point, the bridge team lost situational awareness,\" Moran said.\n\nAucoin acted swiftly because the investigation indicated serious mistakes were made by the crew, Moran said. The Navy has lost confidence in the sailors being relieved.\n\nCollisions should never happen, Moran said. \"We got it wrong.\"\n\nThe report released Thursday details the frantic efforts to account for all the sailors in the darkened, flooding ship, keep her afloat, and rescue the ship's commander who dangled outside his crumpled cabin. The harrowing moments and hours after the collision -- and the heroism that saved the lives of all but seven of the 35 sailors in Berthing 2 -- are recounted in the report.\n\nA \"loud noise\" roused some of the sailors in the Fitzgerald's Berthing 2 compartment, the accident report said. Some in the ship's sleeping and living quarters \"felt an unusual movement,\" while others slept through the crash.\n\nSeconds after the ACX Crystal plowed into the starboard side of the Navy's guided missile destroyer at 1:30 a.m., on June 17, seawater gushed through a 13-foot-by-17-foot gash, knocking some from their beds and threatening to drown all 35 sailors in the compartment.\n\n\"The crew of the Fitzgerald fought hard in the dark of night to save their ship,\" wrote Rear Adm. C.F. Williams, commander of Carrier Strike Group Five. Williams' preliminary report looks at the injuries and deaths that resulted from the crash.\n\nThe Fitzgerald, with a crew of about 300 sailors, was about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan, at the time of the collision. The sea was calm, and the moon shone through broken clouds. The Fitzgerald was dark but for navigation lights, and red bulbs inside the ship.\n\nThe Crystal is a far larger ship at 728 feet and 29,000 tons, compared with the Fitzgerald's 505 feet and 9,000 tons. The port side of the Crystal's bow slammed into the Fitzgerald above the waterline, and the bulb-like bow below the surface crunched into the Fitzgerald near Berthing 2.\n\nBerthing 2 held 42 beds in stacks of three bunks, a bathroom, and a lounge area with sofas, chairs and a television. After the collision, \"nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly.\"\n\nThe Fitzgerald rocked violently, settling into a 7-degree list to her starboard side.\n\n\"One sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water,\" according to the report. \"Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up.\"\n\nWithin a minute, the compartment had flooded and the water rose. Mattresses, furniture and an exercise bike floated in the aisles. The tilting ship complicated the escape, and the water was neck high by the time many had reached the ladder to climb to safety.\n\n\"You can just imagine the confusion and how difficult it was to escape Berthing Compartment 2,\" Moran said.\n\nAs the water forced them to the top of the stairs, two sailors reached into the dark water and fished two more shipmates out. The last rescued sailor had been in the bathroom at the time of the crash. The sailors \"pulled him from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported he was taking is final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nThe seven sailors who drowned were nearest the gash, \"directly in the path of the onrushing water.\"\n\nSailors rushed to seal off flooding to keep the Fitzgerald afloat as water gushed through the gaping hole. Large pipes that carry seawater to fight fires also ruptured, inundating other areas.\n\nThe Crystal slammed into Benson's cabin, crumpling his quarters. Communications outside the ship were severed. Power was lost in the front of the Fitzgerald.\n\nAfter the crash, the Fitzgerald crew changed the ship's lighting at the mast to one red light over another. That configuration, \"red over red,\" is \"the international lighting scheme that indicates a ship that is not under command,\" the report notes.\n\nBenson was in his cabin when the collision occurred, and the crash trapped him. It took five sailors swinging a sledgehammer and kettle bell and hurling their bodies against his door to break through. A junior officer and two chief petty officers yanked debris out of the cabin and crawled in.\n\n\"The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel,\" the report says. \"The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved (Benson), who was hanging from the side of the ship.\"\n\nA helicopter whisked him ashore to a hospital. He was treated and released the next day.\n\nThe Fitzgerald, still listing, crept back to Yokosuka. Navy divers recovered the bodies of the seven drown sailors on June 17.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302668", "label": {"eng": "Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303152", "label": {"eng": "Light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304095", "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304415", "label": {"eng": "Red"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305447", "label": {"eng": "Breathing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309685", "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "314238", "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "315917", "label": {"eng": "Hurling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326820", "label": {"eng": "Bulb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mast_(sailing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "332358", "label": {"eng": "Mast (sailing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moran_(catcher)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "850481", "label": {"eng": "Bill Moran (catcher)"}}]}

The penalties handed out, called nonjudicial punishments, will end their careers, according to the Navy report.\n\nThe head of the Navy's seventh fleet in Japan, Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin, will deliver the sanctions to the sailors.\n\nThe Navy report describes the moments following the collision and the rescue efforts on the ship. It describes how dozens of sailors were awaken from their sleep after feeling the ship rock.\n\nThey then had to race in the dark after discovering their quarters were beginning to flood. Within 90 seconds, seawater began to rush through a gaping hole and it rose to the height of the sailors' waists.\n\nThe water rose as high as their necks, as the officers pushed aside wall lockers, mattresses and other floating debris to make it up a ladder to safety. The last sailor to make it up the ladder was pulled only after being fully submerged in the water.\n\nThe freighter crashed directly into Benson's state room and ripped open a huge hole that trapped him inside. It then took five sailors using a sledgehammer and kettlebell 25 minutes to break down the door to his cabin. The captain was seriously injured and hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nThe main focus of the disaster was in a sleeping compartment called Berthing 2. Out of the 43 sailors assigned to Berthing 2 at the moment of impact, five were on watch and two were not on the ship.

Admiral Moran said that it could take weeks for the investigation to be completed with regards to what caused the crash.\n\nMoran also said that as the investigation proceeds, more punishments may be meted to other sailors. It is not known at this time if any of the sailors will face a court martial.\n\nThe crew on the USS Fitzgerald, which cost $1.5 billion, was comprised of about 300 sailors.

Bill Moran, the deputy chief of naval operations, said that Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin plans to relieve Cmdr. Bryce Benson for cause. On Thursday, the Navy released a preliminary report on the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and the freighter ACX Crystal off the coast of Japan.\n\nThe ship's entire leadership, Moran said, will be relieved, and about a dozen sailors face some punishment, including all of the destroyer's watch. Further sanctions are possible, Moran said.\n\nAucoin acted swiftly because the investigation indicated serious mistakes were made by the crew, Moran said. The Navy has lost confidence in those sailors.\n\nCollisions should never happen, Moran said. \"We got it wrong.\"\n\nA \"loud noise\" roused some of the sailors in the Fitzgerald's Berthing 2 compartment, the accident report said. Some in the ship's sleeping and living quarters \"felt an unusual movement,\" while others slept through the initial crash.\n\nSeconds after the ACX Crystal plowed into the starboard side of the Navy's guided missile destroyer at 1:30 a.m., on June 17, seawater gushed through a 13-foot-by-17-foot gash, knocking some from their beds and threatening to drown all 35 sailors in the compartment.\n\n\"Water on deck!\" sailors shouted. \"Get out!\"\n\nThe harrowing moments and hours after the collision -- and the heroism that saved the lives of all but seven of the 35 sailors in Berthing 2 -- are recounted in the report.\n\nIt details the frantic efforts to account for all the sailors in the darkened, flooding compartment, keep the ship afloat, and rescue the ship's commander who dangled outside his crumpled cabin.\n\n\"The crew of the Fitzgerald fought hard in the dark of night to save their ship,\" wrote Rear Adm. C.F. Williams, commander of Carrier Strike Group Five. Williams' preliminary report looks at the injuries and deaths that resulted from the crash.\n\nThe Fitzgerald, with a crew of about 300 sailors, was about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan, at the time of the collision. The sea was calm, and the moon shone through broken clouds. The ship was dark but for navigation lights, and red bulbs inside.\n\nThe Crystal is a far larger ship at 728 feet and 29,000 tons, compared with the Fitzgerald's 505 feet and 9,000 tons. The port side of the Crystal's bow slammed into the Fitzgerald above the waterline, and the bulb-like bow below the surface crunched into the Fitzgerald near Berthing 2.\n\nFlooding in Berthing 2\n\nBerthing 2 held 42 beds in stacks of three bunks, a bathroom, and a lounge area. It contained a lounge with sofas, chairs and a television. After the collision, \"nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly.\"\n\nThe Fitzgerald rocked violently, settling into a 7-degree list to her starboard side.\n\n\"One sailor saw another knocked out of his rack by water,\" according to the report. \"Others began waking up shipmates who had slept through the initial impact. At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up.\"\n\nWithin a minute, the compartment had flooded and the water rose. Mattresses, furniture and an exercise bike floated in the aisles. The tilting ship complicated the escape, and the water was neck high by the time many had reached the ladder to climb to safety.\n\nAs the water forced them to the top of the stairs, two sailors reached into the dark water and fished two more shipmates out. The last rescued sailor had been in the bathroom at the time of the crash. The sailors \"pulled him from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported he was taking is final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nThe seven sailors who drowned were nearest the gash, \"directly in the path of the onrushing water.\"\n\n\u00a9 2017 USATODAY.COM\n\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302668", "label": {"eng": "Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "302691", "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304095", "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304415", "label": {"eng": "Red"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweet_(singer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "306536", "label": {"eng": "Tweet (singer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309685", "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "309837", "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "314238", "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319582", "label": {"eng": "C (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "324732", "label": {"eng": "Stairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "326820", "label": {"eng": "Bulb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334052", "label": {"eng": "Waterline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341960", "label": {"eng": "Rear admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "342575", "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Moran_(catcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "850481", "label": {"eng": "Bill Moran (catcher)"}}]}

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters that the top three leaders aboard the USS Fitzgerald, which was badly damaged in the collision off the coast of Japan, will be removed from duty aboard the ship. They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, who as the ship's command master chief is its most senior enlisted sailor.\n\nThe actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, based at Yokosuka, Japan, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.\n\nIn addition, nearly a dozen face non-judicial punishment that has yet to be determined, Moran said, adding that details on those actions are to be announced Friday after they are completed.\n\nMoran said the actions are to be taken shortly, although the Navy's investigation into how and why the USS Fitzgerald collided with the container ship in June has not yet been completed.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that he could not fully detail those mistakes because the investigation is ongoing. He said \"the bridge team,\" or the sailors responsible for keeping watch on the ship's bridge to ensure it remains safe, had \"lost situational awareness,\" which left them unable to respond quickly enough to avoid the disaster once the oncoming container ship was spotted.\n\nSeparately, the Navy released the results of a review of events that took place aboard the ship after the collision, focusing on the crew's efforts to control damage, save lives and keep the ship afloat.\n\nThe crash occurred in the pre-dawn hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan in an accident-prone area known for congestion. That is within Japanese territorial waters. The seas were relatively calm, and visibility was unrestricted. The bow of the container ship, the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal, slammed into the Fitzgerald's right side above the waterline, quickly flooding several areas inside the ship, including a berthing, or sleeping, area.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2 at the time, 28 escaped. Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct. It commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,\" the review said.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" it said.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_waters", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311843", "label": {"eng": "Territorial waters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "709530", "label": {"eng": "Command master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

William Moran told reporters at the Pentagon late Thursday. The 7th Fleet also said several junior officers were relieved of duty.\n\nWhile the final investigation into the collision is ongoing, Moran said: \"We do not have to have the investigation complete to start the process.\"\n\nThe Fitzgerald's commanding officer, Cdr. Bryce Benson, and the executive officer, Cdr. Sean Babbiit, were both sleeping, and the master chief petty officer, Brice Baldwin, were not on the bridge at the time of the collision, according to the Navy.\n\nThe bow of the cargo ship directly struck the commander's cabin, according to the Navy's report detailing the immediate aftermath of the collision.\n\nThe report said Benson \"was hanging from the side of the ship\" when he was retrieved by crewmembers who were forced to use a sledgehammer, kettlebell and their bodies to break through the door and gain access to the heavily damaged cabin.\n\nBenson was medically evacuated via helicopter due to the severity of his injuries and he placed on limited duty status on July 11.\n\n\"There are a lot of sailors\" who have undergone the non-judicial punishment process and \"survived and done well,\" Moran said, but \"when you look at what happened here, it's going to be pretty hard to recover from this.\"\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that \"clearly at some point the bridge team lost situational awareness.\"\n\nOne additional sailor has already undergone the captain's mast. Several other sailors are due to go through the process, including the people who were on watch that night.\n\nThe Navy also plans to review its training and qualification procedures in the wake of the deadly collision, in which the Fitzgerald was heavily damaged. It will have to be brought back to the US for repairs.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship. Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision that claimed the lives of seven Fitzgerald sailors, injured injured three more, and damaged both ships,\" the 7th Fleet said in a statement.\n\nThe Navy's report on the immediate aftermath provides a harrowing account of US sailors attempting to escape a rapidly flooding sleeping area that filled with water within minutes after the cargo ship's bow tore a hole in the side of the Fitzgerald. Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died.\n\nThe report describes a chaotic scene following the collision between the Fitzgerald and the much larger cargo ship. Some sailors were thrown from their beds, while others remained asleep. Sailors ran through the sleeping area, attempting to awaken their still-sleeping crew members.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" the report said, referring to the Naval term for a bed.\n\nThe crew had to move quickly to escape the area using a ladder before the sleeping area became completely flooded, with the report saying the room \"was nearly flooded within a span of 30 to 60 seconds.\"\n\n\"By the time the third sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep,\" the report said.\n\nRear Adm. Charles F. Williams wrote in the memo accompanying the report that the sailors in that sleeping area \"should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced.\"\n\nMoran said the investigation will have to be completed before any medals or awards can be adjudicated to any sailors for acts of heroism.\n\nAn acting commanding officer had been assigned to the Fitzgerald following the collision, and a permanent replacement, Cdr. Garrett Miller, has been identified and is expected to take command soon.\n\nThe full investigation will have to be completed in order for the Navy to assign responsibility for the collision.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

William Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters at the Pentagon that the majority of the punishments will be delivered Friday where the ship is homeported in Yokosuka, Japan. One sailor received an undisclosed administrative punishment Thursday.\n\n[Former shipbuilder says quality of Bath-built USS Fitzgerald saved lives in crash]\n\nThe discipline will include likely career-ending actions against Cmdr. Bryce Benson, the ship's captain at the time, and his second in command, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt, Moran said. They and the senior enlisted sailor for the ship, Command Master Chief Brice Baldwin, will be removed as leaders of the ship permanently, Moran said.\n\nThe admiral said that sailors who were supposed to be on watch in the ship's bridge - its nerve center - also will be disciplined. Neither Benson nor Babbitt was in the bridge at the time of the collision, in which the 505-foot destroyer was struck off the coast of Japan by a much heavier container ship, the Philippine-flagged MV ACX Crystal.\n\nThe container ship's bulbous nose ripped a 13-foot by 17-foot hole in the starboard size of the Fitzgerald, flooding one compartment where 35 sailors were inside within 90 seconds, Moran said. The ensuing flooding left disoriented sailors scrambling for their lives amid a soupy mix of personal items, electronics and mattresses, and some of the survivors were forced to seal a door with other sailors still inside in an effort to prevent the ship from sinking.\n\n[Number of missing sailors found dead as US destroyer reaches port]\n\n\"You can just imagine the confusion and how difficult it would have been to escape Berthing Compartment 2,\" Moran said.\n\nBenson's stateroom also was flattened by the collision, injuring him and leaving him incapacitated.

Seven drowned.\n\nThe collision knocked out external communications and cut power in the forward portion of the ship.\n\nThe Navy review of what happened aboard the ship following the collision found that the seven deaths could not be blamed on misconduct.\n\nIt commended the response by the ship's crew, singling out two sailors for taking extra steps to help other out of the flooded berthing space - actions that it said likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\n\n'No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation,' the review said.\n\nThe report said that although some in Berthing 2 heard a loud noise at the time of the collision or were thrown from their beds by the force of the impact, some did not realize what had happened and remained in bed. Some remained asleep.\n\n'At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,' it said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

Two top officers will be kicked out of the Navy as a result of the crash.\n\nOn Thursday, two months after the June 17 crash, the Navy released an alarming preliminary report detailing the collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a 728-foot freighter, the ACX Crystal, which was carrying more than 1,000 containers.\n\nThe collision resulted in seven deaths and stands out as one of the Navy's deadliest accidents in years, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe ship's captain, Commander Bryce Benson, along with his second in command, Commander Sean Babbitt, were both asleep in their cabins when the crash happened.\n\nBenson, Babbitt, the senior enlisted sailor, Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin and everyone who was on watch on the night of the collision will face consequences on Friday. The penalties handed out, called nonjudicial punishments, will end their careers, according to the Navy report.\n\nThe head of the Navy's seventh fleet in Japan, Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin, will deliver the sanctions to the sailors.\n\nThe Navy report describes the moments following the collision and the rescue efforts on the ship. It describes how dozens of sailors were awaken from their sleep after feeling the ship rock.\n\nThey then had to race in the dark after discovering their quarters were beginning to flood. Within 90 seconds, seawater began to rush through a gaping hole and it rose to the height of the sailors' waists.\n\nThe water rose as high as their necks, as the officers pushed aside wall lockers, mattresses and other floating debris to make it up a ladder to safety. The last sailor to make it up the ladder was pulled only after being fully submerged in the water.\n\nThe freighter crashed directly into Benson's state room and ripped open a huge hole that trapped him inside. It then took five sailors using a sledgehammer and kettlebell 25 minutes to break down the door to his cabin. The captain was seriously injured and hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nThe main focus of the disaster was in a sleeping compartment called Berthing 2. Out of the 43 sailors assigned to Berthing 2 at the moment of impact, five were on watch and two were not on the ship. Of the remaining 35 sailors in the area, 28 escaped the flooding and seven died.\n\nUS Navy emergency rescue crews responded immediately when hearing of the trapped sailors on the ship.\n\nREAD MORE: US destroyer failed to respond to warnings before fatal collision - cargo ship captain\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of naval operations said the report made clear that \"serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAs the shipping lanes got more crowded at night, Moran said the sailors who were on watch \"lost situational awareness,\" according to the Times.\n\nBy the time they realized their error, it was too late to avoid the crash with the much larger freighter.\n\nThe report released Thursday still fails to explain the separate investigation of why the crew did not see a large freighter coming towards them and how the collision happened. Admiral Moran said that it could take weeks for the investigation to be completed with regards to what caused the crash.\n\nMoran also said that as the investigation proceeds, more punishments may be meted to other sailors.

Two top officers will be kicked out of the Navy as a result of the crash.\n\nOn Thursday, two months after the June 17 crash, the Navy released an alarming preliminary report detailing the collision between the USS Fitzgerald and a 728-foot freighter, the ACX Crystal, which was carrying more than 1,000 containers.\n\nThe collision resulted in seven deaths and stands out as one of the Navy's deadliest accidents in years, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe ship's captain, Commander Bryce Benson, along with his second in command, Commander Sean Babbitt, were both asleep in their cabins when the crash happened.\n\nBenson, Babbitt, the senior enlisted sailor, Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin and everyone who was on watch on the night of the collision will face consequences on Friday. The penalties handed out, called nonjudicial punishments, will end their careers, according to the Navy report.\n\nThe head of the Navy's seventh fleet in Japan, Vice Admiral Joseph P. Aucoin, will deliver the sanctions to the sailors.\n\nThe Navy report describes the moments following the collision and the rescue efforts on the ship. It describes how dozens of sailors were awaken from their sleep after feeling the ship rock.\n\nThey then had to race in the dark after discovering their quarters were beginning to flood. Within 90 seconds, seawater began to rush through a gaping hole and it rose to the height of the sailors' waists.\n\nThe water rose as high as their necks, as the officers pushed aside wall lockers, mattresses and other floating debris to make it up a ladder to safety. The last sailor to make it up the ladder was pulled only after being fully submerged in the water.\n\nThe freighter crashed directly into Benson's state room and ripped open a huge hole that trapped him inside. It then took five sailors using a sledgehammer and kettlebell 25 minutes to break down the door to his cabin. The captain was seriously injured and hanging from the side of the ship.\n\nThe main focus of the disaster was in a sleeping compartment called Berthing 2. Out of the 43 sailors assigned to Berthing 2 at the moment of impact, five were on watch and two were not on the ship. Of the remaining 35 sailors in the area, 28 escaped the flooding and seven died.\n\nUS Navy emergency rescue crews responded immediately when hearing of the trapped sailors on the ship.\n\nREAD MORE: US destroyer failed to respond to warnings before fatal collision - cargo ship captain\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of naval operations said the report made clear that \"serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAs the shipping lanes got more crowded at night, Moran said the sailors who were on watch \"lost situational awareness,\" according to the Times.\n\nBy the time they realized their error, it was too late to avoid the crash with the much larger freighter.\n\nThe report released Thursday still fails to explain the separate investigation of why the crew did not see a large freighter coming towards them and how the collision happened. Admiral Moran said that it could take weeks for the investigation to be completed with regards to what caused the crash.\n\nMoran also said that as the investigation proceeds, more punishments may be meted to other sailors. It is not known at this time if any of the sailors will face a court martial.\n\nThe crew on the USS Fitzgerald, which cost $1.5 billion, was comprised of about 300 sailors.

William Moran told reporters at the Pentagon late Thursday. The 7th Fleet also said several junior officers were relieved of duty.\n\nWhile the final investigation into the collision is ongoing, Moran said: \"We do not have to have the investigation complete to start the process.\"\n\nThe Fitzgerald's commanding officer, Cdr. Bryce Benson, and the executive officer, Cdr. Sean Babbiit, were both sleeping, and the master chief petty officer, Brice Baldwin, were not on the bridge at the time of the collision, according to the Navy.\n\nThe bow of the cargo ship directly struck the commander's cabin, according to the Navy's report detailing the immediate aftermath of the collision.\n\nThe report said Benson \"was hanging from the side of the ship\" when he was retrieved by crewmembers who were forced to use a sledgehammer, kettlebell and their bodies to break through the door and gain access to the heavily damaged cabin.\n\nBenson was medically evacuated via helicopter due to the severity of his injuries and he placed on limited duty status on July 11.\n\n\"There are a lot of sailors\" who have undergone the non-judicial punishment process and \"survived and done well,\" Moran said, but \"when you look at what happened here, it's going to be pretty hard to recover from this.\"\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" Moran said, adding that \"clearly at some point the bridge team lost situational awareness.\"\n\nOne additional sailor has already undergone the captain's mast. Several other sailors are due to go through the process, including the people who were on watch that night.\n\nThe Navy also plans to review its training and qualification procedures in the wake of the deadly collision, in which the Fitzgerald was heavily damaged. It will have to be brought back to the US for repairs.\n\n\"The collision was avoidable and both ships demonstrated poor seamanship. Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision that claimed the lives of seven Fitzgerald sailors, injured injured three more, and damaged both ships,\" the 7th Fleet said in a statement.\n\nThe Navy's report on the immediate aftermath provides a harrowing account of US sailors attempting to escape a rapidly flooding sleeping area that filled with water within minutes after the cargo ship's bow tore a hole in the side of the Fitzgerald. Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died.\n\nThe report describes a chaotic scene following the collision between the Fitzgerald and the much larger cargo ship. Some sailors were thrown from their beds, while others remained asleep. Sailors ran through the sleeping area, attempting to awaken their still-sleeping crew members.\n\n\"At least one sailor had to be pulled from his rack and into the water before he woke up,\" the report said, referring to the Naval term for a bed.\n\nThe crew had to move quickly to escape the area using a ladder before the sleeping area became completely flooded, with the report saying the room \"was nearly flooded within a span of 30 to 60 seconds.\"\n\n\"By the time the third sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep,\" the report said.\n\nRear Adm. Charles F. Williams wrote in the memo accompanying the report that the sailors in that sleeping area \"should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced.\"\n\nMoran said the investigation will have to be completed before any medals or awards can be adjudicated to any sailors for acts of heroism.\n\nAn acting commanding officer had been assigned to the Fitzgerald following the collision, and a permanent replacement, Cdr. Garrett Miller, has been identified and is expected to take command soon.\n\nThe full investigation will have to be completed in order for the Navy to assign responsibility for the collision.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Sleep_Disorders", "wgt": 100, "id": 583, "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Sleep Disorders"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "341960", "label": {"eng": "Rear admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "343304", "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlebell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "369480", "label": {"eng": "Kettlebell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_L._Moran", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "856026", "label": {"eng": "William L.

Within Fitzgerald, flawed watch stander teamwork and inadequate leadership contributed to the collision,\" the U.S. Seventh Fleet said in a media release.\n\nIn the first detailed account from one of those directly involved in the collision in the early hours of June 17, the captain of the cargo ship the ACX Crystal said in a report seen by Reuters his crew signalled the Fitzgerald with flashing lights around 10 minutes before the collision. The Fitzgerald did not respond or alter course, it said..\n\nThe commercial vessel had the right-of-way under maritime rules and the Fitzgerald, which was hit on the starboard side, was likely at fault.\n\nSeveral U.S. and Japanese investigations are still under way into how the Fitzgerald and the much larger ACX Crystal collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay.\n\nOne pertinent question, said two naval officers who spoke on condition of anonymity, is what was happening at the time in the Fitzgerald's Combat Information Center, where crew members monitor radar that should have detected the approach of a 30,000-ton cargo vessel.\n\nCommander Bryce Benson was relieved \"due to a loss of confidence in his ability to lead\", the Seventh Fleet said.\n\nCommander Sean Babbitt and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin \"contributed to the lack of watch stander preparedness and readiness that was evident in the events leading up to the collision\", it said.\n\nSeveral other junior officers have also been relieved, with administrative action taken against other members of the ship's watch teams.\n\n\"SERIOUS MISTAKES\"\n\nAdmiral Bill Moran, deputy chief of naval operations, told a media briefing earlier in Washington that about nine sailors would face administrative punishments.\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew, and there was no benefit to waiting on taking accountability actions,\" Moran said.\n\nAn official report released on Thursday contained dramatic accounts of what happened when the freighter hit the Fitzgerald.\n\nThe collision, at 1:30 a.m. local time, tore a gash below the Fitzgerald's waterline and sent water pouring into the warship, the report said.\n\n\"Water on deck,\" sailors in a berthing area started yelling. \"Get out,\" they shouted as mattresses, furniture, and even an exercise bicycle began to float.\n\nThe berthing was completely flooded within 60 seconds, although more than two dozen of the 35 sailors in it escaped. The last sailor to be rescued was in the bathroom at the time of the collision.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him, ... at one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free,\" the report said.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the foot of the ladder in the compartment to help others escape.\n\n\"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates,\" the report said.\n\nBenson was trapped in his cabin and five sailors used a sledgehammer to break through the door.\n\n\"Even after the door was open, there was a large amount of debris and furniture against the door, preventing anyone from entering or exiting easily,\" the report said.\n\nThe sailors tied themselves to each other with a belt and rescued Benson, who was hanging from the side of the ship.

They are the commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; the executive officer, Cmrd. Sean Babbitt; and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin. The actions are being taken by Rear Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the Navy's 7th Fleet, because he lost confidence in the three, Moran said.

The ship's routine cruise through familiar, if crowded seas, ended in the most deadly Navy accident in years.\n\nDozens of sailors rocked from their slumber raced against time to escape up a ladder from their flooding quarters. The rushing water was at first waist high, then neck high as sailors pushed aside mattresses, wall lockers other floating debris to clamber up a ladder to safety.

Among those being disciplined from the crew of the USS Fitzgerald are its commanding officer, executive officer and senior enlisted sailor, who will all be relieved of their duties aboard the ship, said Admiral Bill Moran, the vice chief of naval operations.\n\n\"They will be detached from the ship for cause, which (means) we've lost trust and confidence for their ability to lead in those positions and they will not return to the ship,\" Moran told reporters.\n\nSeven sailors drowned in their sleeping berth when the USS Fitzgerald collided with the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal in a busy shipping channel off Japan's coast early on June 17.

It's just we are not done with the investigation,\" Moran said.\n\nAged 19 to 37, the drowned seamen were found by divers in flooded sleeping quarters a day after the collision tore a huge gash in the side of the Fitzgerald. Moran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into what happened in the immediate aftermath of the crash.\n\nMoran spoke to Pentagon reporters just as the Navy released findings from a preliminary inquiry into what happened in the immediate aftermath of the crash. The report found that all seven victims died in the line of duty and their deaths were not due to any misconduct on their part.\n\nInvestigators praised the quick-thinking and \"heroic\" actions of sailors who worked to save shipmates, one of whom had to be dragged from his bunk in a flooding sleeping area as waters quickly rose. One sailor who was rescued moments before he would have drowned reported that \"when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nAdditionally, the report describes how the ship's commanding officer was injured when the merchant ship Crystal struck his cabin, trapping him inside. Fellow sailors had to smash and pry his door open before retrieving the commander, who was \"hanging from the side of the ship. The officer was eventually medically evacuated by helicopter.\n\nMoran praised the actions of the drowned sailors. The last of them to be buried was laid to rest on Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington"}, "type": "loc", "id": "235649"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "304059", "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "308227", "label": {"eng": "Tugboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_of_Special_Scientific_Interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "320060", "label": {"eng": "Site of Special Scientific Interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "341961", "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "357029", "label": {"eng": "Merchant vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleigh_Burke-class_destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "367598", "label": {"eng": "Arleigh Burke-class destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile_destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "389119", "label": {"eng": "Guided missile destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_Education_Board_of_Assam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "390336", "label": {"eng": "Secondary Education Board of Assam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_Leaving_Certificate_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "390337", "label": {"eng": "High School Leaving Certificate (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_communication_specialist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "484422", "label": {"eng": "Mass communication specialist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "533620", "label": {"eng": "Seaman"}}]}

Bill Moran, the vice chief of Naval operations, said leadership aboard the guided-missile destroyer was at least partially at fault in the middle-of-the night collision June 17 with the Philippine-flagged ACX Crystal that left seven sailors dead. The Navy's investigation into the crash about 64 miles southwest of Yokosuka Naval Base is continuing and the service has yet to determine whether the cargo ship was also at fault, he said.\n\nVice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, the commander of 7th Fleet, is expected Friday to officially remove from duty the Fitzgerald's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson; its executive officer, Cmdr. Cmdr. Sean Babbits; and its command master chief, Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin, Moran said. He did not provide specifics about their infractions, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n\"We've lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead in those positions,\" he said Thursday at the Pentagon. \"... When we lose confidence in someone - in their ability to lead - we hold them accountable.\"\n\nBenson, who was asleep inside his quarters when the Crystal's bow burst through its external wall, was injured in the crash. The Navy announced last month he had been temporarily removed from duty for his injuries. Moran said Thursday that he never returned to duty.\n\nBenson and about a dozen sailors on watch duty during the collision will face nonjudicial punishment at Captain's Mast on Friday, Moran said. Nonjudicial punishment includes a range of disciplinary actions that can cripple a career.\n\n\"When you look at what happened here, it's going to be hard to recover,\" Moran said.\n\nHe did not rule out additional punishments or the potential for courts-martial once the investigation is complete.\n\nA Navy investigation into the incident released Thursday shows that the 1:30 a.m. collision blasted a 17-by-13-foot hole into the side of the ship. One of the Fitzgerald's berthings, where 35 sailors were sleeping, flooded within 90 seconds.\n\nJolted awake by the crash, sailors rushed to check on their shipmates, taking actions that investigating officer Rear Adm. C.F. Williams determined likely saved the lives of at least two sailors.\n\nHowever, seven sailors inside the berthing perished, all drowning, according to the report. Those sailors were Gunner's Mate Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19; Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25; Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc T. Truong Huynh, 25; Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez, 26; Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23; Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, 24, and Firecontrolman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm Jr., 37.\n\n\"The crew of the Fitzgerald fought hard in the dead of the night to save their ship,\" Williams wrote. \"Ultimately, those damage control efforts and restoration processes succeeded in safely bringing Fitzgerald into port under her own power.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "wgt": 100, "id": 107, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303092", "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319080", "label": {"eng": "Court-martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rear_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341960", "label": {"eng": "Rear admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "341961", "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "343309", "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile_destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "389119", "label": {"eng": "Guided missile destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar_technician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "602492", "label": {"eng": "Sonar technician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_controlman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "618019", "label": {"eng": "Fire controlman"}}]}

Sean Babbitt, the ship's second-in-command, were fired from their positions because the Navy \"lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead,\" Adm. William F.

Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, had enough information to assign punishments for the collision.\n\nSeas were calm and the pre-dawn sky was still dark with scattered clouds when the ACX Crystal, which is 728 feet long and weighs 29,000 tons, suddenly smashed into the Fitzgerald, which is 505 feet long and 9,000 tons.\n\nThe crash carved a 13-by-17-foot gash into the Fitzgerald's forward starboard side above and below the water line. Water quickly flooded a large room where 42 sailors lay asleep in their berths, as well as a machinery space and the radio room.\n\nSeconds after impact, sailors jolted awake in Berthing 2 yelled \"water on deck\" and \"get out,\" according to a 41-page report on the deadly incident released by the Navy.\n\nBut seawater poured in so fast that it was already waist deep before the 42 sailors first tried to climb out. Thirty-five survived; seven did not.\n\nSaving the ship and getting it back to Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet, took unusual efforts, the report said,\n\n\"Through their swift and, in many cases, heroic actions, members of the Fitzgerald crew saved lives,\" the report said.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation.\"\n\nThe Japanese Coast Guard sent vessels to assist in rescue efforts while Japanese helicopters and a U.S. patrol aircraft flew near the destroyer.\n\nThree sailors required medical evacuation, including Benson, the ship's commander.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304164", "label": {"eng": "Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304182", "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309685", "label": {"eng": "Seawater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321485", "label": {"eng": "Deck (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_(ocean)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "326574", "label": {"eng": "Marine (ocean)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "343309", "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357029", "label": {"eng": "Merchant vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361956", "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Fleet_Activities_Yokosuka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "808758", "label": {"eng": "United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}]}

It's just we are not done with the investigation,\" Moran said.\n\nFollowing the incident, the Navy's 7th Fleet commander said the collision \"could have been much worse.\"\n\n\"The crew's response was swift and effective, and I want to point out -- as we stand by the ship -- how proud I am of them,\" Vice Admiral Joseph Aucoin said.\n\n\"Heroic efforts prevented the flooding from catastrophically spreading, which could have caused the ship to founder or sink,\" Aucoin added. \"It could have been much worse.\"\n\nThe seven missing sailors from the USS Fitzgerald were found dead in flooded compartments later, according to a US Navy official.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304705", "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "320885", "label": {"eng": "Vice admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Japan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "330457", "label": {"eng": "Sea of Japan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "341961", "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship-owner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "355432", "label": {"eng": "Ship-owner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357029", "label": {"eng": "Merchant vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361956", "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_missile_destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "389119", "label": {"eng": "Guided missile destroyer"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Bay", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Bay"}, "type": "loc", "id": "407640"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izu_Peninsula", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "539959", "label": {"eng": "Izu Peninsula"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

Twenty-eight of the soldiers sleeping in the cabin were able to escape and were later rescued, but seven drowned as water flooded the area without 30 to 60 seconds of the collision.\n\nThe Japanese Navy, which aided in rescue operations, is conducting its own investigation separate from the US inquiry.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "341961", "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation_awareness", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361902", "label": {"eng": "Situation awareness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Seventh_Fleet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "512234", "label": {"eng": "United States Seventh Fleet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_Naval_Operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "846385", "label": {"eng": "Vice Chief of Naval Operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Fitzgerald_(DDG-62)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1082162", "label": {"eng": "USS Fitzgerald (DDG-62)"}}]}

Others were thrown from their beds. Then came shouts.\n\n\"Water on deck!\"\n\n\"Get out!\"\n\nIt was 1:30 a.m. off the coast of Japan, and the sea was pouring unimpeded into a berthing area of the guided-missile destroyer . A cargo ship had struck its starboard (right) side, ripping a 220-square-foot hole that spanned the second and third decks.\n\nIn seconds, mattresses, furniture, an exercise bike and wall lockers began floating in the aisles. As the initial shock wore off and training kicked in, sailors moved away from the onrushing water and calmly formed a line to leave the space via a port-side ladder.\n\nAs the last few sailors reached the ladder, water rose to their necks. The last sailor swam toward a light, breathing in water before being pulled to safety. A second sailor managed to escape via the starboard side, closer to the damaged hull. He found himself completely submerged, then discovered an air pocket. He doesn't remember how he escaped before collapsing on the deck.\n\nThese are among the details in a new Navy report of the June 17 collision between the Fitzgerald and the cargo ship ACX Crystal.\n\nSeven sailors died in the tragedy, including Chief Petty Officer Gary L. Rehm Jr., 37, who lived in Hampton and was buried Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nThe report credits Rehm by name for pushing a sailor out from under a fallen locker as the crew fought to escape.\n\nThe partially redacted report focuses on what happened after the collision. Separate investigations are ongoing into what led to the tragedy.\n\nA cover letter signed by Rear Adm. Charles Williams praises the sailors of Berthing 2. They fought back against initial shock and calmly formed lines to leave the damaged area, he said. Two sailors helped their buddies up the ladder, then climbed to the top and reached back into the water, hoping to find others.\n\n\"The crew of the Fitzgerald fought hard in the dark of night to save their ship,\" Williams wrote. \"Through their swift and, in many cases, heroic actions, members of the Fitzgerald crew saved lives.\"\n\nHowever, the collision was so severe that no damage-control measures \"would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation.\"\n\nCalm seas, then disaster\n\nThe Fitzgerald was operating about 56 nautical miles southwest of Yokosuka, Japan, near the Izu Peninsula when the collision happened. Seas were \"relatively calm,\" the report notes. There was scattered cloud cover and unrestricted visibility.\n\nThe collision occurred as the ACX Crystal struck the starboard side of the Fitzgerald with its bulbous bow, below the waterline. The force of the impact bent a wall to a nearly 90-degree angle.\n\n\"As a result, nothing separated Berthing 2 from the onrushing sea, allowing a great volume of water to enter Berthing 2 very quickly,\" the report states.\n\nThe ship listed 14 degrees to port, then settled into a 7-degree starboard list as the sea rushed in from that side.\n\nBerthing 2 is a crew area with 42 racks, or beds. It includes its own shower and bathroom space, plus a lounge with sofas, tables, chairs and a television. Sailors sleep in racks stacked three high. Of the 42 sailors assigned to Berthing 2, five were on watch and two were not aboard. Of the remaining 35, 28 were able to escape.\n\nSailors interviewed for the report had varying reactions after the collision. Some heard the noise. Others felt the ship move. Still others didn't realize what happened and remained in their racks. As the space began to flood, the report praises the sailors for being calm under pressure.\n\n\"Even though the sailors were up to their neck in water by that point, they moved forward slowly and assisted each other,\" the report states.\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the bottom of the ladder to help their buddies. They eventually had to escape themselves, but continued to search \"reaching into the dark water to find anyone they could.\"\n\nFrom the top of the ladder, these two sailors pulled two other sailors from the flooded compartment, the report states.\n\nTwo close calls\n\nThe report details the experiences of two sailors who almost didn't make it.\n\nOne who escaped from the port side was in a bathroom when the collision happened. A flood of water knocked him to the floor. At one point, a locker pinned him against the ceiling. He reached for a pipe and pulled himself free.\n\n\"He was swimming towards the watertight scuttle (a smaller opening on a hatch) when he was pulled from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported that when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water,\" the report states.\n\nOne sailor escaped the berthing compartment via the starboard side, closer to the damage and the onrushing sea. He moved against incoming water and floating furniture and heard someone say, \"Go, go, go it's blocked.\" But he was already underwater. After taking a few breaths in an air pocket, he swam. He doesn't remember how he escaped, but eventually escaped Berthing 2 before collapsing on the main deck. He was the only sailor to get out via the starboard side.\n\nCommander found hanging from ship\n\nThe Crystal's bow struck the cabin of the ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson. Trapped inside, he called the bridge for help.\n\nFive sailors broke into the cabin using a sledgehammer, kettle bell and their bodies, the report states.\n\n\"The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel,\" the report states. \"The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved the CO, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\"\n\nBenson had to be medically evacuated. He has since been temporarily relieved of command due to medical reasons, according to reports.\n\nAs damage control efforts continued, reports of missing sailors began coming in. At 2:25 a.m., two sailors were unaccounted for. At 3:16 a.m., four sailors were missing.\n\nAt 5:40 a.m., a final all-hands muster determined that seven sailors were missing.\n\nTheir bodies were not recovered until the Fitzgerald limped back to Yokosuka Naval Base with the help of other ships. At 5:45 a.m the following day, divers entered Berthing 2 and immediately recovered one sailor. The six others followed.\n\nThe ship's command master chief identified the bodies.\n\n\"We continue to care for both the ship and her crew as they begin the rebuilding process,\" Williams' letter states. \"No one could have foreseen the challenges Fitzgerald would face, but the courage and strength shown by her crew, even as they mourn the loss of seven shipmates, underscore the essence of the Navy's core values.\"\n\nClick here to read the redacted report from the Navy. \"\n\nLessig can be reached by phone at 757-247-7821.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "302668", "label": {"eng": "Coast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302705", "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302732", "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303248", "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305447", "label": {"eng": "Breathing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305469", "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "307257", "label": {"eng": "Pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "308253", "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "308624", "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Couch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311093", "label": {"eng": "Couch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulkhead_(partition)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311846", "label": {"eng": "Bulkhead (partition)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312936", "label": {"eng": "Sky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313141", "label": {"eng": "Wall"}}]}

Fitzgerald's June collision that claimed the lives of him and six other sailors.\n\nA report released by the Navy on Thursday details the heroism of those aboard the ship's Berthing 2, which was filled by the sea less than a minute after the destroyer off the coast of Japan ran into a Philippines-flagged container ship around 1:30 a.m.\n\nServicemembers assisted each other with flooding up to their necks as water filled the area where they had been sleeping, with 28 sailors scrambling through the red-lit water to make it out alive through ladders to dry areas.\n\nChief Fire Controlman Gary Rehm Jr. did not make it out, though one sailor who did said that the 37-year-old pushed him out of the way of a falling locker, the report said.\n\nCargo captain says he warned U.S. warship before crash\n\nOther unidentified sailors waiting at the ladder are credited with saving a sailor who had been in the bathroom during the collision, pulling him through a hatch after he had begun breathing in water.\n\nThe Fitzgerald began pumping water from affected areas soon after the crash, and headed back to its port at Yokusuka, Japan, after the Japanese Coast Guard arrived.\n\nThe Navy said that is still investigating the exact circumstances that led to the ship receiving a 13ft by 17ft hole from the ACX Crystal around 1:30 a.m. on June 16.\n\nHowever, Admiral Bill Moran told reporters Thursday that officers on the ship including the commanding officer Cdr. Bryce Benson would lose their positions.\n\nNavy sailor found hiding after week missing faces court-martial\n\n\"Serious mistakes were made by members of the crew,\" the admiral said, adding that the \"bridge team\" that was supposed to be keeping watch was not able to respond quickly enough.\n\nThe captain of the container ship told investigators that he tried to warn the American vessel but it did not respond.\n\nBenson's cabin, above the waterline, was also \"severely damaged\" when a higher part of the Crystal struck it, leaving Benson himself \"hanging from the side of the ship,\" according to the Navy report.\n\nA rescue crew of other officers reportedly tied themselves together with a belt and made a makeshift harness to save their commander, who had to be evacuated from the ship\n\nMoran said that the ship's executive officer Cmdr. Sean Babbitt and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin would also be removed after the Navy \"lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead.\"\n\nClose to a dozen sailors could face some form of administrative punishment for the collision, according to the admiral.\n\nWith News Wire Services\n\nTags: japan Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation: facebook Tweet", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304145", "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308624", "label": {"eng": "Port"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "315543", "label": {"eng": "Executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "319080", "label": {"eng": "Court-martial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "334052", "label": {"eng": "Waterline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiral", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "341961", "label": {"eng": "Admiral"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Coast_Guard", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan Coast Guard"}, "type": "loc", "id": "427609"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "436157", "label": {"eng": "Cabin (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(nautical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "485985", "label": {"eng": "Bridge (nautical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_controlman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "618019", "label": {"eng": "Fire controlman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "628389", "label": {"eng": "Commander (United States)"}}]}

Hennigan\n\nThe commander and executive officer of a U.S. naval destroyer were relieved from command as punishment for a collision with a container ship off Japan that killed seven sailors in June, one of the worst naval accidents in years, the Navy announced Thursday.\n\nCmdr. Bryce Benson, commander of the Fitzgerald, and Cmdr. Sean Babbitt, the ship's second-in-command, were fired from their positions because the Navy \"lost trust and confidence in their ability to lead,\" Adm. William F. Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters.\n\nThe pair were among about a dozen sailors on the destroyer, including the top enlisted sailor, who could face discipline for the June 17 collision with the Philippine-flagged merchant vessel ACX Crystal about 50 nautical miles southwest of the Japanese port of Yokosuka.\n\nIt's still unclear why the two huge ships didn't see and avoid each other -- that is subject to another investigation -- given modern radar and other sophisticated tracking marine gear, especially on the warship.\n\nBut the Navy said Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the 7th Fleet, had enough information to assign punishments for the collision.\n\nSeas were calm and the pre-dawn sky was still dark with scattered clouds when the ACX Crystal, which is 728 feet long and weighs 29,000 tons, suddenly smashed into the Fitzgerald, which is 505 feet long and 9,000 tons.\n\nThe crash carved a 13-by-17-foot gash into the Fitzgerald's forward starboard side above and below the water line. Water quickly flooded a large room where 42 sailors lay asleep in their berths, as well as a machinery space and the radio room.\n\nSeconds after impact, sailors jolted awake in Berthing 2 yelled \"water on deck\" and \"get out,\" according to a 41-page report on the deadly incident released by the Navy.\n\nBut seawater poured in so fast that it was already waist deep before the 42 sailors first tried to climb out. Thirty-five survived; seven did not.\n\nSaving the ship and getting it back to Yokosuka, home to the 7th Fleet, took unusual efforts, the report said,\n\n\"Through their swift and, in many cases, heroic actions, members of the Fitzgerald crew saved lives,\" the report said.\n\n\"No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation.\"\n\nThe Japanese Coast Guard sent vessels to assist in rescue efforts while Japanese helicopters and a U.S. patrol aircraft flew near the destroyer.\n\nThree sailors required medical evacuation, including Benson, the ship's commander.\n\nLatest updates Copyright \u00a9 2017, Los Angeles Times", "date":

(Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe top two officers and the top enlisted sailor who were aboard the destroyer USS Fitzgerald are among about a dozen sailors who will face discipline following an early-morning collision June 17 that killed seven crew members, a senior Navy officer said Thursday.\n\nAdm. William F. Moran, the vice chief of naval operations, told reporters at the Pentagon that the majority of the punishments will be delivered Friday where the ship is homeported in Yokosuka, Japan. One sailor received an undisclosed administrative punishment Thursday.\n\nThe discipline will include likely career-ending actions against Cmdr. Bryce Benson, the ship's captain at the time, and his second in command, Cmdr. Sean Babbitt, Moran said. They and the senior enlisted sailor for the ship, Command Master Chief Brice A. Baldwin, will be removed as leaders of the ship permanently, Moran said.\n\nThe admiral said that sailors who were supposed to be on watch in the ship's bridge -- its nerve center -- also will be disciplined.

It also blamed poor seamanship by the crews of both the guided-missile cruiser and the ACX Crystal, whose gross tonnage was triple that of the U.S. ship.\n\nSeven members of the Fitzgerald's crew died in the collision, which bashed in a large section of the ship above the waterline and caused extensive damage below. Water poured in through a large gash near its keel -- a 13-ft. by 17-ft. opening that was made by the cargo ship's bulbous bow -- as sailors responded to a collision that struck around 1:30 a.m.\n\n\"Through their swift and in many cases heroic actions, members of the crew saved lives,\" the Navy said. The report found that the sailors responded to flooding, structural damage and reports of a fire as they worked to restore the ship's power, propulsion and guidance.\n\nThe damage spanned two decks, and water poured into the ship -- particularly into Berthing 2, which held 42 beds and a lounge for the crew. By the time one sailor jumped from his top bunk, the water was chest high, the Navy says.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2, when the ship was struck, 28 escaped the flooding, and seven sailors died. The area flooded in a span of 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nHere's how the report describes one sailor's escape:\n\nThe ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was trapped in his cabin, which was hit by the Crystal's bow. After sailors used \"a sledgehammer, kettlebell, and their bodies\" to break through the door, the amount of debris forced them to remove the door's hinges to pry it open enough for a person to squeeze through.\n\nThose who entered could see night sky, looking through an opening of ripped steel and shredded wires, according to the report.\n\nA helicopter was later used to take Benson to a naval hospital in Japan. After the crash, the Fitzgerald switched over to using paper navigation charts due to a loss of its systems.\n\nThe damage limited the Fitzgerald's maximum speed to 5 knots and gave the ship a 5-degree starboard list. After it arrived in port, divers recovered the bodies of seven crew members.\n\nBenson had already been temporarily relieved of his duties due to injuries he suffered in the crash. He's now being reassigned to the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., where the Navy says he'll be able to receive medical care.\n\nSeveral junior officers were also relieved of their duties, the Navy said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokosuka,_Kanagawa", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yokosuka"}, "type": "loc", "id": "65915"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302732", "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304164", "label": {"eng": "Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "317931", "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "321485", "label": {"eng": "Deck (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334052", "label": {"eng": "Waterline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_vessel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "357029", "label": {"eng": "Merchant vessel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361953", "label": {"eng": "Bow (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "361956", "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamanship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "368243", "label": {"eng": "Seamanship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlebell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "369480", "label": {"eng": "Kettlebell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "389080", "label": {"eng": "Keel"}}]}

Bryce Benson, Executive Officer Cmdr. Sean Babbitt, and Master Chief Petty Officer Brice Baldwin for failure to avoid a collision with a freighter in the early morning hours of June 17 off the coast of Japan.\n\nAll three will face career-ending administrative reprimand, called non-judicial punishment, in one of the Navy's deadliest accidents at sea in years, the Navy announced Thursday.\n\nAn official Navy investigation of the deadly collision between the destroyer USS Fitzgerald and a commercial container ship in June features a vivid description of the heroic efforts of the crew to save fellow sailors and the ship itself as ocean water gushed through the punctured hull.\n\nThe investigation focused on the action of the crew in response to the accident, not the events leading up to the collision, but as many as a dozen sailors could face career-ending letters of reprimand as a result of the accident.\n\nBut the investigation concludes the seven sailors who died did so in the line of duty and not due to misconduct or any failing on the part of fellow sailors, many of whom were asleep when the commercial container ship ACX Crystal rammed the destroyer, opening a huge gash in the starboard hull and flooding the berthing area.\n\n\"The Sailors assigned to Berthing 2 should be commended for their response to the dangerous and deadly threat they faced,\" the report said. \"Through their swift and, in many cases, heroic actions, members of the FITZGERALD crew saved lives. No damage control efforts, however, would have prevented Berthing 2 from flooding completely within the first two minutes following the collision, or the deadly circumstances in that situation.\"\n\nThe 43-page report is filled with harrowing accounts of last-minute escapes, and extraordinary efforts to save sailors who were trapped by rising water, or caught in the twisted wreckage.\n\nOf the ship's 300 member crew, 34 were trapped in the area that was flooded when the bulbous bow of the container ship cut a 13-by-17-foot hole in the side of the Fitzgerald.\n\nOf those 27 were able to escape, in some cases only because of the efforts of sailors operating under great emotional and physical stress.\n\nThe ship's command officer was sleeping in a part of the ship that took a direct hit, his cabin located just above the waterline.\n\n\"Five Sailors used a sledgehammer, kettlebell, and their bodies to break through the door into the CO's cabin, remove the hinges, and then pry the door open enough to squeeze through,\" the report recounts.\n\n\"A junior officer and two chief petty officers removed debris from in front of the door and crawled into the cabin. The skin of the ship and outer bulkhead were gone and the night sky could be seen through the hanging wires and ripped steel. The rescue team tied themselves together with a belt in order to create a makeshift harness as they retrieved the CO, who was hanging from the side of the ship.\"\n\nThe official investigation is filled with dramatic accounts of similar determination to save as many of the crew as possible, all while avoiding any signs of panic.\n\n\"They did what is expected of Sailors in such a situation: they checked racks to ensure everyone was awake; they formed calm lines to egress the space on the port side, away from the flooding; and they filed out of the Berthing in an orderly fashion, assisting one another to the ladder,\" the report concluded.\n\nIn one instance, two sailors who had been helping others from the bottom of a ladder were eventually forced to climb the ladder as water reached the very top of the compartment.\n\nBefore climbing the ladder, they checked and could not did not see any other sailors, but once they made it to the top, they reached back into the dark water and were able to pull two other sailors from the flooded compartment. Both were completely underwater when they were pulled to safety.\n\nThe report, based on interviews with the crew, was written in a style that eschewed the usual official jargon, and painted a dramatic picture of suspense, such as the account of sailor who was caught in the bathroom, when the waters flooded his compartment.\n\n\"Lockers were floating past him and he scrambled across them towards the main berthing area. At one point, he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free. He made his way to the only light he could see, which was coming from the port side watertight scuttle. He was swimming towards the watertight scuttle when he was pulled from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported that when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nOr the story of the sailor who jumped out of his rack into water that was chest deep and rising.\n\n\"He moved through the lounge furniture and against the incoming sea. Someone said, 'Go, go, go, it's blocked,' but he was already underwater. He was losing his breath under the water but found a small pocket of air. After a few breaths in the small air pocket, he eventually took one final breath and swam. He lost consciousness at this time and does not remember how he escaped from Berthing 2, but he ultimately emerged from the flooding into Berthing 1, where he could stand to his feet and breathe.\"\n\nThe full report, which is officially known as Supplemental Preliminary Inquiry and Line of Duty Determination, can be read below.\n\nA separate investigation into the cause of the accident, and the failure of the U.S. warship to take evasive action, is still underway.\n\nThe report does note that seas were \"relatively calm at 2 to 4 feet,\" \"the moon was relatively bright,\" with \"scattered cloud cover and unrestricted visibility\" at the time of the collision.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302732", "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305056", "label": {"eng": "Door"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305469", "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306965", "label": {"eng": "Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "310304", "label": {"eng": "Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulkhead_(partition)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "311846", "label": {"eng": "Bulkhead (partition)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334052", "label": {"eng": "Waterline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-judicial_punishment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "336781", "label": {"eng": "Non-judicial punishment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "360393", "label": {"eng": "Scuttling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "361956", "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlebell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "369480", "label": {"eng": "Kettlebell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprimand", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "391976", "label": {"eng": "Reprimand"}}]}

The Fitzgerald sailed into the path of the much larger container ship in the middle of the night, suffering heavy damage.\n\nThe report details the harrowing moments after impact, as sailors' sleeping quarters quickly filled with water. As dazed sailors clamored through water that was almost immediately waist deep, they were forced to navigate heavy floating debris to reach a ladder. The last sailor to escape was in water over his head when his fellow crew hauled him up the escape hatch.\n\n\"Two sailors chose to remain at the bottom of the ladder ... in order to help others out of the space, even as the water was rising and began flooding the space around them,\" the report states. \"The choices made by these two sailors likely saved the lives of at least two of their shipmates.\"\n\nTwo minutes after impact, the sleeping berth they were evacuating had completely filled with water.\n\nThe container ship, which suffered minimal damage, struck the Fitzgerald directly on the captain's sleeping quarters. The report details a dramatic rescue of Cmdr. Bryce Benson, after five junior crew members used sledgehammers to knock in the blocked door. When they finally got inside, Benson was hanging out a gaping hole in the side of the ship. They tied their belts together to create a makeshift harness and the ship's captain to safety.\n\nIn all, The New York Times reported 12 sailors, including the two top officers aboard and the top enlisted sailor, will face administrative actions that will likely end their careers after an investigation revealed the collision was the result of poor navigation practices by the Fitzgerald, and not the shipping container the Crystal.

It also blamed poor seamanship by the crews of both the guided-missile cruiser and the ACX Crystal, whose gross tonnage was triple that of the U.S. ship.\n\nSeven members of the Fitzgerald's crew died in the collision, which bashed in a large section of the ship above the waterline and caused extensive damage below. Water poured in through a large gash near its keel -- a 13-ft. by 17-ft. opening that was made by the cargo ship's bulbous bow -- as sailors responded to an emergency around 1:30 a.m.\n\n\"Through their swift and in many cases heroic actions, members of the crew saved lives,\" the Navy said. The report found that the sailors responded to flooding, structural damage and reports of a fire as they worked to restore the ship's power, propulsion and guidance.\n\nThe damage spanned two decks, and water poured into the ship -- particularly into Berthing 2, which held 42 beds and a lounge for the crew. By the time one sailor jumped from his top bunk, the water was chest high, the Navy says.\n\nOf the 35 sailors who were in Berthing 2, when the ship was struck, 28 escaped the flooding, and seven sailors died. The area flooded in a span of 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nHere's how the report describes one sailor's escape:\n\n\"The last Sailor to be pulled from Berthing 2 was in the bathroom at the time of the collision and a flood of water knocked him to the deck (floor). Lockers were floating past him and he scrambled across them towards the main berthing area. At one point he was pinned between the lockers and the ceiling of Berthing 2, but was able to reach for a pipe in the ceiling to pull himself free. He made his way to the only light he could see, which was coming from the port side watertight scuttle. He was swimming towards the watertight scuttle when he was pulled from the water, red-faced and with bloodshot eyes. He reported that when taking his final breath before being saved, he was already submerged and breathed in water.\"\n\nThe ship's commanding officer, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was trapped in his cabin, which was hit by the Crystal's bow. After sailors used \"a sledgehammer, kettlebell, and their bodies\" to break through the door, the amount of debris forced them to remove the door's hinges to pry it open enough for a person to squeeze through.\n\nThose who entered could see night sky, looking through an opening of ripped steel and shredded wires, according to the report.\n\nA helicopter was later used to take Benson to a naval hospital in Japan. After the crash, the Fitzgerald switched over to using paper navigation charts due to a loss of its systems.\n\nThe damage limited the Fitzgerald's maximum speed to 5 knots and gave the ship a 5-degree starboard list. After it arrived in port, divers recovered the bodies of seven crew members.\n\nBenson had already been temporarily relieved of his duties due to injuries he suffered in the crash. He's now being reassigned to the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., where the Navy says he'll be able to receive medical care.\n\nSeveral junior officers were also relieved of their duties, the Navy said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc", "id": "233"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302732", "label": {"eng": "Steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304140", "label": {"eng": "Destroyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "304164", "label": {"eng": "Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "305555", "label": {"eng": "Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305560", "label": {"eng": "Commanding officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sledgehammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "309953", "label": {"eng": "Sledgehammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "310233", "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "313125", "label": {"eng": "Container ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "317931", "label": {"eng": "Navigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "321485", "label": {"eng": "Deck (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334052", "label": {"eng": "Waterline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "357030", "label": {"eng": "Cargo ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuttling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "360393", "label": {"eng": "Scuttling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "361953", "label": {"eng": "Bow (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "361956", "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettlebell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "369480", "label": {"eng": "Kettlebell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "389080", "label": {"eng": "Keel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabin_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "436157", "label": {"eng": "Cabin (ship)"}}]}

Of the 35 sailors in the sleeping area at the time of the collision, 28 were able to escape, but the remaining seven sailors died.\n\nAccording to the initial reports, the Fitzgerald's crew did not take action needed to avoid the collision.\n\n\"The occupants of Berthing 2 described a rapidly flooding space, estimating later that the space was almost flooded within a span of 30 to 60 seconds\", according to the 41-page report, which estimated the sailors had no more than 90 seconds to escape.\n\nIt details the frantic efforts to account for all the sailors in the darkened, flooding compartment, keep the ship afloat, and rescue the ship's commander who dangled outside his crumpled cabin.\n\nBecause the investigation is ongoing, he could not say if the Fitzgerald was \"solely responsible\" for the collision with the ACX Crystal. One sailor received an undisclosed administrative punishment Thursday. \"Get out\", they shouted as mattresses, furniture and even an exercise bicycle began to float. Sailors staying in that area estimate the space flooded within 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nThe report confirms one sailor said Rehm pushed him out from under a falling locker.\n\nThe Navy's investigation into the crash about 64 miles southwest of Yokosuka Naval Base is continuing and the service has yet to determine whether the cargo ship was also at fault, he said.\n\n\"By the time the third sailor to leave arrived at the ladder, the water was already waist deep\", the report said.\n\nTwo minutes after impact, the sleeping berth they were evacuating had completely filled with water.\n\nThe final sailor pulled to safety had inhaled water and was pulled from the water \"red-faced\" with \"bloodshot eyes\".\n\nRelated News: 18 August 2017 Husband of missing SA woman found dead 18 August 2017

In an official statement, the U.S. Navy said the officers were relieved of their duties because they were accountable for the collision that claimed the lives of seven U.S. sailors.\n\nSeveral other officers and listed watch standers have also been held accountable for the collision that took place June 17. This is not the first time the U.S. Navy has taken a strict action against commanding officer or other crew members after they were found guilty of contributing to a tragedy or not reacting appropriately to the situation.\n\nIn August 2012, the commanding officer of guided missile destroyer Porter was relieved less than three weeks after the ship collided with a Japanese oil tanker in the Strait of Hormuz. He was removed \"due to loss of confidence in Arriola's ability to command,\" a navy spokesperson had said, according to reports.\n\nLast year in January, three U.S. Navy officers were relieved of their duties after two command boats were captured by Iran, multiple reports said.\n\nA Navy jet pilot, Timothy Dorsey, never flew again after he was found guilty of basic error in judgment in 1987. He shot down an Air Force jet over the Mediterranean Sea and injured two people, as per the reports.\n\nNavy officers have also faced similar punishment over misconduct. Earlier this month, two Marine cop commanders were relieved from their duty over sharing inappropriate pictures of female troops in a private Facebook group, reports said.\n\nVarious factors including the accused's rank are considered in different cases for deciding the nature of the punishment.\n\nThe USS Fitzgerald that had 35 sailors on board was traveling at a speed of about 56 nautical miles to Yokosuk. According to the maritime rules, vessels should give way to ships that are on their starboard side (a term used for the right side of the ship) where the damage was done. This raised questions if the U.S. ship was at fault, BBC reported.\n\nIn the official statement Commander, U.S. 7th fleet said the accident was avoidable but shipmen of both the ships showed poor seamanship. The statement further said that inadequate leadership contributed to the collision.\n\nCmdr. Bryce Benson was relieved due to a \"loss of confidence in his ability to lead.\" \"Cmdr. Benson is being reassigned to Naval District Washington at the Washington Navy Yard, where he will have access to medical facilities in the area.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters late Thursday, Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

Seven sleeping closest to the hole drowned but 28 somehow made it out alive, even though the entire space was nearly flooded within 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nThe Navy's harrowing recreation of those terror-filled seconds was put together to answer the one question all the families of the dead had: Did they suffer? The answer: Not for long.\n\nThe collision sent sailors, lockers and televisions flying. With water rushing in on the starboard side, they started yelling \"water on deck,\" and \"get out,\" scrambling toward a ladder on the port side.\n\n\"After the initial shock,\" the report says, the sailors \"lined up in a relatively calm and orderly manner to climb the port side ladder ... even though (they) were up to their necks in water by that point.\"\n\nTwo sailors stayed at the bottom of the ladder, helping others up. When those two finally climbed out they stayed at the top of the ladder and reached down underwater to pull two more to safety before they had to retreat to another level to seal the flooded compartment from the rest of the ship.\n\nOne of the dead, Gary Rehm, was buried Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery. According to the report, he rescued a sailor trapped under a fallen locker.\n\nThe ship's captain, along with the officers and men on watch that night are considered to have made critical mistakes which caused the collision.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "wgt": 100, "id": 132, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities", "wgt": 100, "id": 145, "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Utilities"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Maritime", "wgt": 100, "id": 288, "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Maritime"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/By_Topic", "wgt": 100, "id": 653, "label": "dmoz/Society/History/By Topic"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "type": "loc", "id": "177"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303000", "label": {"eng": "Water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303600", "label": {"eng": "Ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_(armed_forces)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "304952", "label": {"eng": "Officer (armed forces)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hull_(watercraft)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305469", "label": {"eng": "Hull (watercraft)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "306147", "label": {"eng": "Sailor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_National_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "322719", "label": {"eng": "Arlington National Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "361956", "label": {"eng": "Port and starboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "380006", "label": {"eng": "Scrambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_chief_petty_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "509686", "label": {"eng": "Master chief petty officer"}}]}

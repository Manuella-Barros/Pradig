That's according to the new analysis of dispensing records from nearly 94% of U.S. retail pharmacies from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe report, published in the journal JAMA on Wednesday, used the IQVIA prescription database to compile the first look at the national uptake of GLP-1 drugs among that age group. Nearly 31,000 children aged 12 to 17 and more than 162,000 people aged 18 to 25 used the medications in 2023 alone, said Dr. Joyce Lee, a University of Michigan pediatrician and diabetes expert who led the research.\n\n\"What it's suggesting is that it's one of the tools in the toolbox and there are more providers prescribing this medication for the population,\" she said.\n\nThe report shows that the number of 12- to 25-year-olds using any GLP-1 drug -- including older medications first approved to treat diabetes in 2005 and for weight loss in 2014 -- climbed from about 8,700 a month in 2020 to more than 60,000 a month in 2023, a nearly 600% increase. The rise occurred even as prescriptions of other drugs among those patients fell by about 3%.\n\nThose who received the drugs were just a fraction of young people who struggle with obesity, Lee noted. About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents and about 42% of adults have the chronic disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nRelated Story: Why the Diabetes Drug Ozempic Is Taking Weight-Obsessed Hollywood by Storm\n\nIn early 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children and teens with obesity be evaluated early and treated aggressively, including with surgery and medication if warranted.\n\nMcKenzie, the Tennessee teen, said he began gaining weight five years ago, during puberty.\n\n\"I started turning to food for all of my problems,\" he said.\n\nThe extra weight made his asthma worse and put him in danger of developing diabetes, his doctor said. He tried to follow medical advice by cutting out sugary soda and snack foods and exercising more, but the efforts failed to make a difference.\n\n\"My old doctor told me there was nothing he could do,\" he said. \"He told me it was my fault.\"\n\nIn early 2023, McKenzie connected with Dr. Joani Jack, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who regularly prescribes GLP-1 drugs for kids.\n\nRelated Story: FDA Says Fake Ozempic Shots Are Being Sold Through Some Legitimate Sources\n\n\"I told him I've seen 10 other people just like you today and we have lots of tools and treatment options,\" Jack said. Those typically include intensive behavioral and nutrition interventions combined with medication, if necessary.\n\nIn McKenzie's case, Jack prescribed the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which in late 2022 was approved for use in U.S. children over age 12. More than 6,000 kids in that age group received Wegovy in 2023, the new data show. More than 7,600 received Ozempic, which is approved to treat diabetes in adults, but can be used off-label in adolescents. Others received older GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda and Trulicity.\n\nMcKenzie said he had no notable side effects from the medication, but Lee noted that some young people report nausea, vomiting or constipation, including symptoms so serious that they stop the drugs.\n\nIt's important to understand the surging use of these medications in young people, Lee said. The drugs are meant for continuing use, so \"we really need to think about the long-term safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the drugs are expensive and often difficult to obtain, either because of supply problems or because they're not covered by insurance.\n\nNotably, government-run Medicaid plans paid for nearly half of the GLP-1 drugs prescribed to 12- to 17-year-olds and about a quarter of those used by people aged 18 to 25, the research found. Commercial insurance covered care for nearly 44% of the younger kids and about two-thirds of those who were older.\n\nToday, McKenzie says his asthma is better and he looks forward to interacting with co-workers and friends.\n\n\"I have a lot of self-confidence now, a lot more than I used to,\" he said. \"It has changed everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@gvwire.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Semaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1_receptor_agonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dulaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://gvwire.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/22095029/AP24142726431580.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586734", "eventUri": "eng-9586734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

Even as millions of older adults clamor for drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, monthly use of the medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists soared nearly 600% between 2020 and 2023 in people under 25 - and as young as 12.\n\nAt 17, Israel McKenzie was so burdened by obesity that he stopped going to high school in person and was embarrassed to speak to people at his restaurant job.\n\n\"I was in a really dark place,\" says McKenzie, whose weight had climbed to 335 pounds on his 6-foot-1 frame, despite repeated efforts to diet and exercise. \"I had given up hope.\"\n\nBut last year, the weight-loss drug Wegovy helped him shed 110 pounds in nine months, making the rural Tennessee teen part of a surge of adolescents and young adults using diabetes and obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, new research shows.\n\nEven as millions of older adults clamor for drugs such as Ozempic and Wegovy, monthly use of the medications soared in people aged 12 to 25. That's according to the new analysis of dispensing records from nearly 94% of U.S. retail pharmacies from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe report, published in the journal JAMA on Wednesday, used the IQVIA prescription database to compile the first look at the national uptake of GLP-1 drugs among that age group. Nearly 31,000 children aged 12 to 17 and more than 162,000 people aged 18 to 25 used the medications in 2023 alone, said Dr. Joyce Lee, a University of Michigan pediatrician and diabetes expert who led the research.\n\n\"What it's suggesting is that it's one of the tools in the toolbox and there are more providers prescribing this medication for the population,\" she said.\n\nThe report shows that the number of 12- to 25-year-olds using any GLP-1 drug -- including older medications first approved to treat diabetes in 2005 and for weight loss in 2014 -- climbed from about 8,700 a month in 2020 to more than 60,000 a month in 2023, a nearly 600% increase. The rise occurred even as prescriptions of other drugs among those patients fell by about 3%.\n\nThose who received the drugs were just a fraction of young people who struggle with obesity, Lee noted. About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents and about 42% of adults have the chronic disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn early 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children and teens with obesity be evaluated early and treated aggressively, including with surgery and medication if warranted.\n\nMcKenzie, the Tennessee teen, said he began gaining weight five years ago, during puberty.\n\n\"I started turning to food for all of my problems,\" he said.\n\nThe extra weight made his asthma worse and put him in danger of developing diabetes, his doctor said. He tried to follow medical advice by cutting out sugary soda and snack foods and exercising more, but the efforts failed to make a difference.\n\n\"My old doctor told me there was nothing he could do,\" he said. \"He told me it was my fault.\"\n\nIn early 2023, McKenzie connected with Dr. Joani Jack, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who regularly prescribes GLP-1 drugs for kids.\n\n\"I told him I've seen 10 other people just like you today and we have lots of tools and treatment options,\" Jack said. Those typically include intensive behavioral and nutrition interventions combined with medication, if necessary.\n\nIn McKenzie's case, Jack prescribed the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which in late 2022 was approved for use in U.S. children over age 12. More than 6,000 kids in that age group received Wegovy in 2023, the new data show. More than 7,600 received Ozempic, which is approved to treat diabetes in adults, but can be used off-label in adolescents. Others received older GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda and Trulicity.\n\nMcKenzie said he had no notable side effects from the medication, but Lee noted that some young people report nausea, vomiting or constipation, including symptoms so serious that they stop the drugs.\n\nIt's important to understand the surging use of these medications in young people, Lee said. The drugs are meant for continuing use, so \"we really need to think about the long-term safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the drugs are expensive and often difficult to obtain, either because of supply problems or because they're not covered by insurance.\n\nNotably, government-run Medicaid plans paid for nearly half of the GLP-1 drugs prescribed to 12- to 17-year-olds and about a quarter of those used by people aged 18 to 25, the research found. Commercial insurance covered care for nearly 44% of the younger kids and about two-thirds of those who were older.\n\nToday, McKenzie says his asthma is better and he looks forward to interacting with co-workers and friends.\n\n\"I have a lot of self-confidence now, a lot more than I used to,\" he said. \"It has changed everything.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

Professional organizations have set this as a guideline for when to reassess whether a treatment is providing clinically meaningful weight loss.\n\nUsers start with a low dose of these medications and gradually increase it over time until they reach a targeted dose. But the analysis shows that nearly a third of people - more than 30% - dropped out after the first four weeks of treatment, before reaching the targeted dose.\n\nThe findings are based on pharmacy and medical claims data for about 170,000 people with insurance coverage under Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who were prescribed GLP-1 medications that were approved to treat weight management between 2014 and 2023.\n\n\"These are long-term medications to treat a chronic disease,\" said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago, who was not involved in the new research. \"This is absolutely a marathon, not a sprint. And when we do treat this as a sprint, I think patients are likely to get off of medication much faster.\"\n\nExperts say that impatience with results is one of many reasons patients might stop treatment. Only about two-thirds of adults who have used injectable weight-loss drugs say they feel that they were effective, according to a new KFF poll. And people who stopped using the medications were significantly less optimistic about their benefits: Only about half of those who had used injectable weight-loss drugs in the past said they were effective, compared with nearly three-quarters of those who were actively using the treatments.\n\nSide effects - such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation that are common early on - may also drive people away. Data from the longest clinical trial of Wegovy showed that 17% of people using the drug decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects.\n\nBut experts say that many deterrents can be managed with appropriate counseling from a provider.\n\n\"If you don't have frequent touchpoints, frequent interactions, then it's really it's hard to manage side effects. It's hard to manage expectations. It's hard to see if there's improvement in some of these other metabolic comorbidities,\" said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research.\n\nEach person will respond to treatment differently and assess the balance of costs and benefits to their heath differently.\n\n\"There's not a line in the sand for every single person. Physicians and patients have to just look at all the data and make a decision about treatment together,\" she said.\n\nFindings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield data emphasize the important role that providers can play in helping patients stick with their treatment with GLP-1s.\n\nPeople who met with their providers less frequently - and those living in underserved regions with broader health inequities - were more likely to discontinue GLP-1 treatment sooner. Each additional follow-up visit increased a patient's chances of staying on the treatment by 60%, said Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\nAnd although most prescriptions came from primary care physicians, those who were prescribed GLP-1s by endocrinologists or others with expertise in weight management were more likely to reach at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment.\n\n\"Wraparound support services really make a difference - whether a person has lifestyle support management, nutrition, diet and side effect management,\" Hashmi said, and \"health equity matters. Social drivers of health - transportation, access to food, socioeconomic status - all of that also makes a difference.\"\n\nCost can often be a prohibitive factor for these medications - a month's supply of GLP-1 medications can often cost about $1,000 - but the analysis included only people who had insurance plans that covered weight-loss medication prescriptions. Insurance plan copays may have affected cost considerations, but the individuals in this analysis were not paying out-of-pocket for their treatment.\n\nBut using GLP-1 treatments are still an investment in many ways.\n\n\"Whether it's an employer trying to make a decision or an individual patient trying to make a decision, it's really important to understand the success factors,\" Hashmi said. \"We want the investment to pay off.\"\n\nAnother new report supports the claim that the benefits of GLP-1s are extended with long-term, consistent treatment.\n\nOne of the first reports offering real-world data on GLP-1 efficacy found that people using the medicines had lost an average of about 1.4% of their starting body weight after three months, which steadily increased to an average of about 3% weight loss after a full year on the treatment. The analysis from Dandelion Health, a health care analytics firm, is based on the electronic health records of nearly 17,000 people who were prescribed a GLP-1 from 2019 through 2023.\n\nCompared with a group of people with a similar set of clinical characteristics - matched closely on demographic factors such as age and ethnicity, treatment indicators such as average body mass index and diabetes prevalence, history of treatments such as bariatric surgery and prevalence of related comorbidities - the analysis found that those on GLP-1s lost about twice as much weight.\n\nThese injected medications, called GLP-1 agonists, are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss. In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose at least 10% of their starting weight. But the new report suggests that the real-world efficacy is not as promising as clinical trial data would suggest.\n\nAnd experts warn that the GLP-1 treatment process can be different for everyone.\n\n\"There are some people who are under-responders, there are some people who are over-responders, and there's some that respond as expected to the medication,\" Narang said. \"Studies are still happening to understand why.\"\n\nThe data from Dandelion Health showed that the 10% of people with the best response to GLP-1s had results that mirrored what clinical trials found, but the 10% with the least success with the treatments had no weight change, or even an increase in weight, over time.\n\nStill, GLP-1 medications may have benefits far beyond weight loss - for heart and liver health, for example - which may extend even to people who don't lose as many pounds as they might have expected, experts say.\n\n\"It's really important to not use the scale as the only outcome of whether you should stay on this medication.

Professional organizations have set this as a guideline for when to reassess whether a treatment is providing clinically meaningful weight loss.\n\nUsers start with a low dose of these medications and gradually increase it over time until they reach a targeted dose. But the analysis shows that nearly a third of people - more than 30% - dropped out after the first four weeks of treatment, before reaching the targeted dose.\n\nThe findings are based on pharmacy and medical claims data for about 170,000 people with insurance coverage under Blue Cross Blue Shield plans who were prescribed GLP-1 medications that were approved to treat weight management between 2014 and 2023.\n\n\"These are long-term medications to treat a chronic disease,\" said Dr. Disha Narang, an endocrinologist and director of obesity medicine at Endeavor Health in Chicago, who was not involved in the new research. \"This is absolutely a marathon, not a sprint. And when we do treat this as a sprint, I think patients are likely to get off of medication much faster.\"\n\nExperts say that impatience with results is one of many reasons patients might stop treatment. Only about two-thirds of adults who have used injectable weight-loss drugs say they feel that they were effective, according to a new KFF poll. And people who stopped using the medications were significantly less optimistic about their benefits: Only about half of those who had used injectable weight-loss drugs in the past said they were effective, compared with nearly three-quarters of those who were actively using the treatments.\n\nSide effects - such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation that are common early on - may also drive people away. Data from the longest clinical trial of Wegovy showed that 17% of people using the drug decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects.\n\nBut experts say that many deterrents can be managed with appropriate counseling from a provider.\n\n\"If you don't have frequent touchpoints, frequent interactions, then it's really it's hard to manage side effects. It's hard to manage expectations. It's hard to see if there's improvement in some of these other metabolic comorbidities,\" said Dr. Jody Dushay, an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the new research.\n\nEach person will respond to treatment differently and assess the balance of costs and benefits to their heath differently.\n\n\"There's not a line in the sand for every single person. Physicians and patients have to just look at all the data and make a decision about treatment together,\" she said.\n\nFindings from the Blue Cross Blue Shield data emphasize the important role that providers can play in helping patients stick with their treatment with GLP-1s.\n\nPeople who met with their providers less frequently - and those living in underserved regions with broader health inequities - were more likely to discontinue GLP-1 treatment sooner. Each additional follow-up visit increased a patient's chances of staying on the treatment by 60%, said Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\nAnd although most prescriptions came from primary care physicians, those who were prescribed GLP-1s by endocrinologists or others with expertise in weight management were more likely to reach at least 12 weeks of continuous treatment.\n\n\"Wraparound support services really make a difference - whether a person has lifestyle support management, nutrition, diet and side effect management,\" Hashmi said, and \"health equity matters. Social drivers of health - transportation, access to food, socioeconomic status - all of that also makes a difference.\"\n\nCost can often be a prohibitive factor for these medications - a month's supply of GLP-1 medications can often cost about $1,000 - but the analysis included only people who had insurance plans that covered weight-loss medication prescriptions. Insurance plan copays may have affected cost considerations, but the individuals in this analysis were not paying out-of-pocket for their treatment.\n\nBut using GLP-1 treatments are still an investment in many ways.\n\n\"Whether it's an employer trying to make a decision or an individual patient trying to make a decision, it's really important to understand the success factors,\" Hashmi said. \"We want the investment to pay off.\"\n\nAnother new report supports the claim that the benefits of GLP-1s are extended with long-term, consistent treatment.\n\nOne of the first reports offering real-world data on GLP-1 efficacy found that people using the medicines had lost an average of about 1.4% of their starting body weight after three months, which steadily increased to an average of about 3% weight loss after a full year on the treatment. The analysis from Dandelion Health, a health care analytics firm, is based on the electronic health records of nearly 17,000 people who were prescribed a GLP-1 from 2019 through 2023.\n\nCompared with a group of people with a similar set of clinical characteristics - matched closely on demographic factors such as age and ethnicity, treatment indicators such as average body mass index and diabetes prevalence, history of treatments such as bariatric surgery and prevalence of related comorbidities - the analysis found that those on GLP-1s lost about twice as much weight.\n\nThese injected medications, called GLP-1 agonists, are in high demand because they have proved to be so effective for weight loss. In clinical trials, some of the stronger medications like Wegovy and Zepbound have been found to help people lose at least 10% of their starting weight. But the new report suggests that the real-world efficacy is not as promising as clinical trial data would suggest.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter\n\nSign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nAnd experts warn that the GLP-1 treatment process can be different for everyone.\n\n\"There are some people who are under-responders, there are some people who are over-responders, and there's some that respond as expected to the medication,\" Narang said. \"Studies are still happening to understand why.\"\n\nThe data from Dandelion Health showed that the 10% of people with the best response to GLP-1s had results that mirrored what clinical trials found, but the 10% with the least success with the treatments had no weight change, or even an increase in weight, over time.\n\nStill, GLP-1 medications may have benefits far beyond weight loss - for heart and liver health, for example - which may extend even to people who don't lose as many pounds as they might have expected, experts say.\n\n\"It's really important to not use the scale as the only outcome of whether you should stay on this medication. People might be making slow but steady progress, which could warrant ongoing treatment,\" Dushay said. \"There may be some direct benefits of the medication in the absence of significant weight loss, which is also why you should be talking to your doctor at length about why you're using this medication.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "deidre_mcphillips@cnn.com", "name": "Deidre McPhillips", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Semaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Injection (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Endocrinology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cross_Blue_Shield_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blue Cross Blue Shield Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Israel_Deaconess_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiser_Family_Foundation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaiser Family Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Medical_School", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Medical School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metabolism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_care_physician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary care physician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comorbidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjay_Gupta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjay Gupta"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight_Loss", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Weight Loss", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss/Clinics_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss/Clinics and Services", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Weight_Loss/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Health/Weight Loss/Support Groups", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1644966236.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586734", "eventUri": "eng-9586734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

That's according to the new analysis of dispensing records from nearly 94% of U.S. retail pharmacies from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe report, published in the journal JAMA on Wednesday, used the IQVIA prescription database to compile the first look at the national uptake of GLP-1 drugs among that age group. Nearly 31,000 children aged 12 to 17 and more than 162,000 people aged 18 to 25 used the medications in 2023 alone, said Dr. Joyce Lee, a University of Michigan pediatrician and diabetes expert who led the research.\n\n\"What it's suggesting is that it's one of the tools in the toolbox and there are more providers prescribing this medication for the population,\" she said.\n\nThe report shows that the number of 12- to 25-year-olds using any GLP-1 drug -- including older medications first approved to treat diabetes in 2005 and for weight loss in 2014 -- climbed from about 8,700 a month in 2020 to more than 60,000 a month in 2023, a nearly 600% increase. The rise occurred even as prescriptions of other drugs among those patients fell by about 3%.\n\nThose who received the drugs were just a fraction of young people who struggle with obesity, Lee noted. About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents and about 42% of adults have the chronic disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn early 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children and teens with obesity be evaluated early and treated aggressively, including with surgery and medication if warranted.\n\nMcKenzie, the Tennessee teen, said he began gaining weight five years ago, during puberty.\n\n\"I started turning to food for all of my problems,\" he said.\n\nThe extra weight made his asthma worse and put him in danger of developing diabetes, his doctor said. He tried to follow medical advice by cutting out sugary soda and snack foods and exercising more, but the efforts failed to make a difference.\n\n\"My old doctor told me there was nothing he could do,\" he said. \"He told me it was my fault.\"\n\nIn early 2023, McKenzie connected with Dr. Joani Jack, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who regularly prescribes GLP-1 drugs for kids.\n\n\"I told him I've seen 10 other people just like you today and we have lots of tools and treatment options,\" Jack said. Those typically include intensive behavioral and nutrition interventions combined with medication, if necessary.\n\nIn McKenzie's case, Jack prescribed the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which in late 2022 was approved for use in U.S. children over age 12. More than 6,000 kids in that age group received Wegovy in 2023, the new data show. More than 7,600 received Ozempic, which is approved to treat diabetes in adults, but can be used off-label in adolescents. Others received older GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda and Trulicity.\n\nMcKenzie said he had no notable side effects from the medication, but Lee noted that some young people report nausea, vomiting or constipation, including symptoms so serious that they stop the drugs.\n\nIt's important to understand the surging use of these medications in young people, Lee said. The drugs are meant for continuing use, so \"we really need to think about the long-term safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the drugs are expensive and often difficult to obtain, either because of supply problems or because they're not covered by insurance.\n\nNotably, government-run Medicaid plans paid for nearly half of the GLP-1 drugs prescribed to 12- to 17-year-olds and about a quarter of those used by people aged 18 to 25, the research found.

That's according to the new analysis of dispensing records from nearly 94% of U.S. retail pharmacies from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe report, published in the journal JAMA on Wednesday, used the IQVIA prescription database to compile the first look at the national uptake of GLP-1 drugs among that age group. Nearly 31,000 children aged 12 to 17 and more than 162,000 people aged 18 to 25 used the medications in 2023 alone, said Dr. Joyce Lee, a University of Michigan pediatrician and diabetes expert who led the research.\n\n\"What it's suggesting is that it's one of the tools in the toolbox and there are more providers prescribing this medication for the population,\" she said.\n\nThe report shows that the number of 12- to 25-year-olds using any GLP-1 drug -- including older medications first approved to treat diabetes in 2005 and for weight loss in 2014 -- climbed from about 8,700 a month in 2020 to more than 60,000 a month in 2023, a nearly 600% increase. The rise occurred even as prescriptions of other drugs among those patients fell by about 3%.\n\nThose who received the drugs were just a fraction of young people who struggle with obesity, Lee noted. About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents and about 42% of adults have the chronic disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn early 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children and teens with obesity be evaluated early and treated aggressively, including with surgery and medication if warranted.\n\nMcKenzie, the Tennessee teen, said he began gaining weight five years ago, during puberty.\n\n\"I started turning to food for all of my problems,\" he said.\n\nThe extra weight made his asthma worse and put him in danger of developing diabetes, his doctor said. He tried to follow medical advice by cutting out sugary soda and snack foods and exercising more, but the efforts failed to make a difference.\n\n\"My old doctor told me there was nothing he could do,\" he said. \"He told me it was my fault.\"\n\nIn early 2023, McKenzie connected with Dr. Joani Jack, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who regularly prescribes GLP-1 drugs for kids.\n\n\"I told him I've seen 10 other people just like you today and we have lots of tools and treatment options,\" Jack said. Those typically include intensive behavioral and nutrition interventions combined with medication, if necessary.\n\nIn McKenzie's case, Jack prescribed the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which in late 2022 was approved for use in U.S. children over age 12. More than 6,000 kids in that age group received Wegovy in 2023, the new data show. More than 7,600 received Ozempic, which is approved to treat diabetes in adults, but can be used off-label in adolescents. Others received older GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda and Trulicity.\n\nMcKenzie said he had no notable side effects from the medication, but Lee noted that some young people report nausea, vomiting or constipation, including symptoms so serious that they stop the drugs.\n\nIt's important to understand the surging use of these medications in young people, Lee said. The drugs are meant for continuing use, so \"we really need to think about the long-term safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the drugs are expensive and often difficult to obtain, either because of supply problems or because they're not covered by insurance.\n\nNotably, government-run Medicaid plans paid for nearly half of the GLP-1 drugs prescribed to 12- to 17-year-olds and about a quarter of those used by people aged 18 to 25, the research found. Commercial insurance covered care for nearly 44% of the younger kids and about two-thirds of those who were older.\n\nToday, McKenzie says his asthma is better and he looks forward to interacting with co-workers and friends.\n\n\"I have a lot of self-confidence now, a lot more than I used to,\" he said. \"It has changed everything.\"\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

That's according to the new analysis of dispensing records from nearly 94% of U.S. retail pharmacies from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe report, published in the journal JAMA on Wednesday, used the IQVIA prescription database to compile the first look at the national uptake of GLP-1 drugs among that age group. Nearly 31,000 children aged 12 to 17 and more than 162,000 people aged 18 to 25 used the medications in 2023 alone, said Dr. Joyce Lee, a University of Michigan pediatrician and diabetes expert who led the research.\n\n\"What it's suggesting is that it's one of the tools in the toolbox and there are more providers prescribing this medication for the population,\" she said.\n\nThe report shows that the number of 12- to 25-year-olds using any GLP-1 drug -- including older medications first approved to treat diabetes in 2005 and for weight loss in 2014 -- climbed from about 8,700 a month in 2020 to more than 60,000 a month in 2023, a nearly 600% increase. The rise occurred even as prescriptions of other drugs among those patients fell by about 3%.\n\nThose who received the drugs were just a fraction of young people who struggle with obesity, Lee noted. About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents and about 42% of adults have the chronic disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn early 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children and teens with obesity be evaluated early and treated aggressively, including with surgery and medication if warranted.\n\nMcKenzie, the Tennessee teen, said he began gaining weight five years ago, during puberty.\n\n\"I started turning to food for all of my problems,\" he said.\n\nThe extra weight made his asthma worse and put him in danger of developing diabetes, his doctor said. He tried to follow medical advice by cutting out sugary soda and snack foods and exercising more, but the efforts failed to make a difference.\n\n\"My old doctor told me there was nothing he could do,\" he said. \"He told me it was my fault.\"\n\nIn early 2023, McKenzie connected with Dr. Joani Jack, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children's Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who regularly prescribes GLP-1 drugs for kids.\n\n\"I told him I've seen 10 other people just like you today and we have lots of tools and treatment options,\" Jack said. Those typically include intensive behavioral and nutrition interventions combined with medication, if necessary.\n\nIn McKenzie's case, Jack prescribed the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which in late 2022 was approved for use in U.S. children over age 12. More than 6,000 kids in that age group received Wegovy in 2023, the new data show. More than 7,600 received Ozempic, which is approved to treat diabetes in adults, but can be used off-label in adolescents. Others received older GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda and Trulicity.\n\nMcKenzie said he had no notable side effects from the medication, but Lee noted that some young people report nausea, vomiting or constipation, including symptoms so serious that they stop the drugs.\n\nIt's important to understand the surging use of these medications in young people, Lee said. The drugs are meant for continuing use, so \"we really need to think about the long-term safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the drugs are expensive and often difficult to obtain, either because of supply problems or because they're not covered by insurance.\n\nNotably, government-run Medicaid plans paid for nearly half of the GLP-1 drugs prescribed to 12- to 17-year-olds and about a quarter of those used by people aged 18 to 25, the research found. Commercial insurance covered care for nearly 44% of the younger kids and about two-thirds of those who were older.\n\nToday, McKenzie says his asthma is better and he looks forward to interacting with co-workers and friends.\n\n\"I have a lot of self-confidence now, a lot more than I used to,\" he said. \"It has changed everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "nhpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Hampshire Public Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Semaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1_receptor_agonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_prescription", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical prescription"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Academy of Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Michigan", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dulaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Off-label use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chattanooga, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Drugs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0760747/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3375+0+313/resize/1200x675!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F79%2F7d%2Fee49e8fb4703b51b90b5630c0a0d%2Fap24142726431580.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586734", "eventUri": "eng-9586734", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Because these patients dropped out before completing the recommended treatment, they were less likely to achieve the medical benefits of weight loss, the study said.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Association is a federation of dozens of for-profit and nonprofit companies that provide health insurance for about 118 million people in 50 states. The insurer released the non-peer-reviewed data to inform decisionmakers and the public about how these two wildly popular weight-loss drugs are being used and to \"paint a clearer picture of what makes somebody successful,\" said Razia Hashmi, vice president for clinical affairs at Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nA spokeswoman for Novo Nordisk, which markets Saxenda and Wegovy, declined to comment on the study, which has not been published in an independent medical journal.\n\nThis class of weight-loss medications, called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has become immensely popular with consumers. Quarterly sales of anti-obesity drugs surpassed $1.1 billion midway through 2023, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nThese drugs were initially used to treat diabetes. Drugmakers later won approval to market them for weight loss and heart disease. Drug companies continue to study other potential uses for GLP-1s, which can cost more than $10,000 per year out of pocket.\n\nBecause the drugs are so widely prescribed and expensive, Hashmi said it's important to understand how patients are using these drugs to lose weight and whether they're achieving health benefits. It's also critical to understand why such a large portion of patients have quit the medications before they'd gotten up to the right dosage to begin reaping the benefits.\n\nThe study said patients prescribed weight-loss drugs by an endocrinologist or obesity specialist were likelier to stick with them longer. Patients who had visited their doctor or other prescriber frequently during the first 12 weeks were also more likely to continue taking the medications. The study found that young adults between 18 and 34 were more likely to ditch the medication before completing the prescribed course.\n\nSaxenda, which requires daily injections, was the only GLP-1 drug approved for weight loss from 2014 to 2021. The study said fewer than 6,000 individuals began the medication each year during that period.\n\nWhen Wegovy gained Food and Drug Administration approval for weight loss in 2021 as a weekly injectable, prescriptions soared, reaching nearly 121,000 scripts in 2023, the study said.\n\nEmployers and health insurance plans are attempting to slow spending on these drugs. Many insurers have imposed requirements such as prior authorization or step therapy, which mandates that people try less expensive drugs first. In some cases, employers and insurers are denying coverage altogether.\n\nThe study did not address how different Blue Cross Blue Shield insurance plans cover these weight-loss medications.

That\u00b4s according to the new analysis of dispensing records from nearly 94% of U.S. retail pharmacies from 2020 to 2023.\n\nThe report, published in the journal JAMA on Wednesday, used the IQVIA prescription database to compile the first look at the national uptake of GLP-1 drugs among that age group. Nearly 31,000 children aged 12 to 17 and more than 162,000 people aged 18 to 25 used the medications in 2023 alone, said Dr. Joyce Lee, a University of Michigan pediatrician and diabetes expert who led the research.\n\n\"What it\u00b4s suggesting is that it\u00b4s one of the tools in the toolbox and there are more providers prescribing this medication for the population,\" she said.\n\nIsrael McKenzie stands for a portrait in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Tuesday, May 21, 2024. In 2023, the weight-loss drug Wegovy helped him shed 110 pounds in nine months, making him part of what new research shows is a sharp surge in the use of powerful medications to treat diabetes and obesity in adolescents and young adults. (AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\n\nThe report shows that the number of 12- to 25-year-olds using any GLP-1 drug - including older medications first approved to treat diabetes in 2005 and for weight loss in 2014 - climbed from about 8,700 a month in 2020 to more than 60,000 a month in 2023, a nearly 600% increase. The rise occurred even as prescriptions of other drugs among those patients fell by about 3%.\n\nThose who received the drugs were just a fraction of young people who struggle with obesity, Lee noted. About 20% of U.S. children and adolescents and about 42% of adults have the chronic disease, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn early 2023, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children and teens with obesity be evaluated early and treated aggressively, including with surgery and medication if warranted.\n\nMcKenzie, the Tennessee teen, said he began gaining weight five years ago, during puberty.\n\n\"I started turning to food for all of my problems,\" he said.\n\nThe extra weight made his asthma worse and put him in danger of developing diabetes, his doctor said. He tried to follow medical advice by cutting out sugary soda and snack foods and exercising more, but the efforts failed to make a difference.\n\n\"My old doctor told me there was nothing he could do,\" he said. \"He told me it was my fault.\"\n\nIn early 2023, McKenzie connected with Dr. Joani Jack, a pediatric obesity specialist at Children\u00b4s Hospital at Erlanger in Chattanooga, Tennessee, who regularly prescribes GLP-1 drugs for kids.\n\n\"I told him I\u00b4ve seen 10 other people just like you today and we have lots of tools and treatment options,\" Jack said. Those typically include intensive behavioral and nutrition interventions combined with medication, if necessary.\n\nIn McKenzie\u00b4s case, Jack prescribed the weight-loss drug Wegovy, which in late 2022 was approved for use in U.S. children over age 12. More than 6,000 kids in that age group received Wegovy in 2023, the new data show. More than 7,600 received Ozempic, which is approved to treat diabetes in adults, but can be used off-label in adolescents. Others received older GLP-1 drugs such as Saxenda and Trulicity.\n\nMcKenzie said he had no notable side effects from the medication, but Lee noted that some young people report nausea, vomiting or constipation, including symptoms so serious that they stop the drugs.\n\nIt's important to understand the surging use of these medications in young people, Lee said. The drugs are meant for continuing use, so \"we really need to think about the long-term safety and effectiveness of these medications for this population,\" she said.\n\nIn addition, the drugs are expensive and often difficult to obtain, either because of supply problems or because they\u00b4re not covered by insurance.\n\nNotably, government-run Medicaid plans paid for nearly half of the GLP-1 drugs prescribed to 12- to 17-year-olds and about a quarter of those used by people aged 18 to 25, the research found. Commercial insurance covered care for nearly 44% of the younger kids and about two-thirds of those who were older.\n\nToday, McKenzie says his asthma is better and he looks forward to interacting with co-workers and friends.\n\n\"I have a lot of self-confidence now, a lot more than I used to,\" he said. \"It has changed everything.\"\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u00b4s Science and Educational Media Group.

But this class of medications, which help people with Type 2 diabetes and obesity lower their blood sugar and promote weight loss, is now a household name.\n\n\"It's everywhere,\" Dr. Razia Hashmi, Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) vice president of clinical affairs, said Tuesday during a town hall at Fortune's Brainstorm Health conference in Dana Point, Calif. \"It's part of our conversation. It's on social media, your family's talking about it, we're talking about it in the boardroom, we're talking about it in the break room. There is, obviously, a lot of excitement about it -- the adoption's been exponential -- but there is so much more to learn.\"\n\nNot all of it is positive, as revealed by a new study conducted by Blue Health Intelligence that examined 170,000 GLP-1 users who were prescribed the medication for weight loss. Released Tuesday, it's \"the largest-ever study done, real-world evidence study\" of the medication, Hashmi said.\n\nThe study shows patients aren't taking the medication properly, despite its skyrocketing popularity. (Net sales of anti-obesity drugs such as semaglutide, or Wegovy, hit $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2023, per the Congressional Budget Office.)\n\nMost patients taking GLP-1 drugs for weight management didn't stay on their prescribed treatment for the minimum 12 weeks, meaning they were unlikely to attain clinically meaningful weight loss. Young adults (aged 18-34) were more likely to drop out of treatment sooner, and more than 30% of all patients dropped out after just four weeks, before reaching the targeted dose.\n\nThe gastrointestinal side effects of GLP-1s, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, may be a reason people don't complete treatment, the study notes. But because the medication is intended to treat obesity and Type 2 diabetes -- both serious, chronic conditions -- quitting cold turkey without a doctor's guidance may be dangerous.\n\n\"One has to ask, why?\" Hashmi said. One clue, she said, comes from the doctor prescribing the medication. \"Your provider matters. If your provider is trained in endocrinology, if they are trained and board-certified in obesity management, the likelihood that you will stay on the treatment is much, much higher.\n\n\"The other thing that we found was that each additional visit to your doctor, regardless of specialty, increased your chances of reaching that meaningful weight loss goal by 60%.\"\n\nAnother finding Hashmi highlighted was that support for diet, nutrition, behavioral health, and side effect management matters. The same goes for health equity; the study revealed people who lived in underserved health regions were less likely to complete 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nAndrew Nusca, Fortune editorial director of Brainstorm Tech, moderated the town hall, which also featured Dr. Rami Bailony, cofounder and CEO of Enara Health. While acknowledging that such research on GLP-1 usage and outcomes is needed, Bailony stressed the drugs should be just one component of obesity management.\n\n\"[GLP-1s] will change the way we do care but, ultimately, what matters is the framework in which those are delivered,\" he said. \"Our mission is to deliver personalized, data-driven treatment, and we do that by integrating directly into primary care and cardiology care, and [it] will be the data layer that personalizes that treatment that's going to make a difference in the end.\"\n\nFor more on weight management:", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

But when patients go off the drugs, the gears shift into reverse: The food cravings creep back, and then the pounds do too. Within a year of stopping semaglutide -- better known by its brand names Wegovy or Ozempic -- people regain, on average, two-thirds of the weight they lost. Tirzepatide, also known as Zepbound or Mounjaro, follows a similar pattern. And so the conventional medical wisdom now holds that these obesity drugs are meant to be taken indefinitely, possibly for a lifetime.\n\nTo pharmaceutical companies selling the blockbuster drugs -- known collectively as GLP-1 drugs, after the natural hormone they mimic -- that might be a pretty good proposition. To patients paying more than $1,000 a month out of pocket, not so much. Most Americans simply cannot afford the cost month after month after month.\n\nThis has forced some doctors to get creative, devising regimens to sub in cheaper, if less well-known, alternatives. GLP-1 drugs do work remarkably well, inducing more weight loss more quickly than any other obesity medication on the market, but some doctors now wonder whether patients need to be on GLP-1 drugs, specifically, forever. \"What if we do a short-term investment, use it for six months to a year to get 50 pounds off?\" asks Sarah Ro, an obesity-medicine doctor and the director of the University of North Carolina Physicians Network Weight Management Program. Then, as she and other doctors are now exploring, patients might transition to older, less expensive alternatives for long-term weight maintenance.\n\nIn fact, Ro has already helped patients -- she estimates hundreds -- make the switch out of financial necessity. Few of her patients in rural North Carolina have insurance that covers the new obesity drugs, and few can afford to continually pay out of pocket. In April, many also lost coverage when North Carolina's health insurance for state employees abruptly cut off GLP-1 drugs for obesity. Ro switched her patients to older drugs such as topiramate, phentermine, metformin, and bupropion/naltrexone, plus lifestyle counseling. It's not exactly an ideal solution, as these medications are generally considered less effective -- they lead to about half as much weight loss as GLP-1 drugs do -- but it is a far less expensive one. When prescribed as generics, Ro told me, a month's supply of one of these drugs might cost as little as $10.\n\nJamy Ard, an obesity-medicine doctor at Wake Forest University, has also switched regimens for patients who lost coverage of GLP-1 drugs after retiring and getting on Medicare, which currently does not pay for any drugs to treat obesity. (Like many researchers in the field, Ard has received grants and consulting fees from companies behind obesity drugs.) Doctors I spoke with didn't know of any studies about switching from GLP-1 drugs to older ones, but Ard says this research is a practical necessity in the United States. With GLP-1 medications exploding in popularity, more and more patients taking them will suddenly lose coverage when they hit retirement age and go on Medicare. \"Now I've got to figure out, well, how do I treat them?\" he told me.\n\nLong-term data on the older drugs themselves are, in fact, pretty sparse, despite the drugs having been available for years and years. Until Ozempic came along, obesity drugs were not a lucrative market, so companies weren't interested in funding the long and very expensive trials that follow patients for several years. \"Studies like that cost a fortune,\" Louis Aronne, an obesity-medicine doctor at Weill Cornell Medicine, told me. Some of the longest-term follow-up data about these drugs come from patients at his practice in Manhattan -- not a representative population, he admits -- which he published in a five-year study funded by the National Institutes of Health. (Aronne has also received grants and consulting fees from the makers of obesity drugs.)\n\nHow patients do after switching from GLP-1 to older drugs is entirely anecdotal, but so far outcomes do seem to vary quite a bit. A small minority of patients who stop GLP-1 injections are actually able to maintain their weight on diet and exercise, without any additional medications. Others may find that the older pills are simply not effective for them. In Ro's experience, about 50 to 60 percent of her patients have so far successfully kept the weight off using one or more older drugs, on top of lifestyle changes such as cutting out fast food and sugary sodas.\n\nThe best drug to switch to may also depend on the patient. Each of the older medications works differently, hitting different biological pathways. The combination of naltrexone and bupropion, for example, makes food less pleasurable and seems to work especially well in people with a tendency toward emotional eating, Ard said. Topiramate, meanwhile, makes carbonated drinks unpleasant, which could help patients who drink a lot of soda. The older drugs also have different side effects. Aronne rattled off for me a list of health risks that might rule out a particular drug for a particular patient: seizures for bupropion, or glaucoma for topiramate. Finding the most effective and best-tolerated drug for a patient may take some trial and error.\n\nDoctors are now discovering that some patients can maintain the weight they lost on lower or less frequent doses of GLP-1 drugs. \"For the first time in my career, we're lowering the dose of medicines,\" Aronne said. Just reducing the dose doesn't save money, though, as lower-dose injection pens cost the same as those with higher doses. However, by instead extending the time between doses from the standard seven days to a longer 10-day interval, doctors told me, some patients have been able to stretch their supplies.\n\nBut tapering off obesity medications entirely, GLP-1 or otherwise, will probably not be possible for most patients. Weight loss tends to trigger a powerful set of compensatory mechanisms in the body, which evolved long ago to protect us from starvation. The more weight we lose, the more the body fights back. The fight never quite goes away, and most patients will likely require some kind of continued intervention just to stay at a lower weight. Long-term weight maintenance has always been the \"holy grail\" of obesity treatment, Susan Yanovski, a co-director of the Office of Obesity Research at the National Institutes of Health told me. The best maintenance strategy -- whether it involves GLP-1 drugs, and at what dose -- may ultimately be pretty individual.

In comparison, the number of young people receiving other medications stayed relatively flat over the same period.\n\nThe drugs, GLP-1 receptor agonists, have gained a reputation in recent years for their drastic effect on weight -- and other health benefits (SN: 12/13/23).\n\nFirst approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005, GLP-1 drugs have continued to roll in. Ozempic, an injectable form of the drug semaglutide, was approved for adults with type 2 diabetes in 2017; liraglutide for weight loss in adults in 2014 and kids 12 and older in 2020; and Wegovy, high dose semaglutide, for weight loss in adults in 2021. A year later, Wegovy's approval extended to kids.\n\nLee's team wanted to find out what was happening in the real world: Who was actually receiving these drugs? The researchers analyzed information about people ages 12 to 25 using a database that reports prescriptions from U.S. pharmacies.\n\nThe uptick Lee's team reported in people receiving GLP-1 drugs wasn't surprising, she says, given enthusiasm among doctors and patients. What stood out was the extent of the rise -- and the difference between males and females. More than three times as many females ages 18 to 25 received the drugs than males of the same age. That may reflect societal bias around weight, she says.\n\nLee wants to learn more about the medications' safety, side effects and how well they work over time. Clinical trials have shown that the drugs can spur weight loss, she says, \"but we don't know what the long-term effects are.\"", "source": {"uri": "sciencenews.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Science News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Semaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolescence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adolescence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAMA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JAMA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_Medicine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrinology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Endocrinology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_diabetes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Type 2 diabetes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liraglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1_receptor_agonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injection (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Cannabis", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Cannabis", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.sciencenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/052124_mr_semaglutide-yng-wmn_feat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586734", "eventUri": "eng-9586734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-22", "textStart": 338, "textEnd": 344}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

When patients quit early, as most patients do, that money is wasted. And the result is higher health insurance costs for everyone on their employer's health plan.\"\n\nThe study, which examined the pharmacy and medical records of nearly 170,000 people from July 2014 to December 2023, found that 58% of patients did not finish the 12-week treatment plan for Saxenda and Wegovy, also known as liraglutide and semaglutide. Patients are typically advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase it until reaching the recommended dose, but the study revealed that over 30% of individuals stopped the treatment within the first four weeks, before reaching the target dose.\n\nThose who ceased using these medications expressed lower confidence in their effectiveness and said that the side effects such as nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and constipation, especially at the beginning, led them to stop treatment.\n\nThe data from Blue Cross Blue Shield emphasizes the crucial role healthcare providers can play in helping patients adhere to their GLP-1 treatment. Patients who had regular visits with their healthcare provider or another prescriber within the initial 12 weeks were more inclined to adhere to the medication regimen. Dr. Razia Hashmi, vice president of clinical affairs for Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, mentioned that each additional follow-up visit boosted a patient's chances of staying on the treatment by 60%.\n\nThe study also noted that patients who had fewer follow-up appointments with their healthcare providers, as well as those residing in underserved areas with notable health disparities, were more likely to terminate GLP-1 treatment prematurely.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com", "source": {"uri": "rttnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTTNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Semaglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liraglutide", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liraglutide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Cross_Blue_Shield_Association", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blue Cross Blue Shield Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_loss", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight loss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucagon-like_peptide-1", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glucagon-like peptide-1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health equity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diarrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constipation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constipation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Cardiovascular_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Cardiovascular Disorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://cdn.rttnews.com/articleimages/ustopstories/2024/may/weightloss-22052024-lt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586734", "eventUri": "eng-9586734", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-07-", "textStart": 700, "textEnd": 709}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

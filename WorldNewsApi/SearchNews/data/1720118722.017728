Officers decided to stop the Vauxhall Zafira along Nottingham Road, in Basford, Nottingham, on suspicion that it was overloaded on Monday, May 27. But they were shocked to find double the number of legally allowed passengers inside - including eight children who were not wearing seatbelts. The male driver has now been summonsed to court for driving without due care and attention. He will also face charges of failing to ensure children under 14 were wearing seatbelts and using a motor vehicle where the number of passengers was likely to cause danger. Police were stunned to find 14 people, including children, crammed into a seven-seater car. Pictured: An officer speaks to people outside the vehicle Police pulled over the vehicle (pictured) in Nottingham Road, Basford, Nottingham on Monday May 27 PC Dan Bird, of Nottinghamshire Police's Radford Road Response team, said: 'Carrying too many passengers in a vehicle is a serious offence, primarily due to the safety risks it poses. 'People are twice as likely to die in a car accident if they do not wear a seatbelt, which is why we were extremely alarmed to find eight children without seatbelts inside this vehicle. 'Drivers should always adhere to their vehicle's passenger capacity as failure to do so can have devastating consequences. 'Furthermore, driving with more passengers than there are seatbelts can void your car insurance, leaving you uninsured in the event of an accident. 'You can also face penalty points on your license and a fine. In severe cases, you might be summoned to court where penalties could be more significant.' READ MORE Police discover 11 adults and four children crammed inside car that looked 'overloaded' (and NONE of them are wearing seatbelts!) After the force posted pictures of the bizarre incident on social media, baffled web users reacted with astonishment. One person commented 'How do u even get 14 people in a car' while another added 'This beggars belief.' A third said: 'Our kids fight with 2 in the back!' and another wrote: 'It's just common sense, why as an adult would you need to be told that.' By law, all drivers and passengers must wear a seat belt while travelling in a car, van or other vehicles whether sitting in the front or as a passenger in the back seat. The person driving is responsible for making sure children under the age of 14 are wearing one. For passengers aged 14 and over it is their own responsibility to wear a seat belt. Passengers caught failing to wear a seat belt when one is available, unless they have a special reason not to, can be asked to pay a \u00a3100 fine. This fine can increase to \u00a3500 if the case goes to court.

Addressing over 200 participants at the 30th Anniversary of NPP-USA under the theme \u201c30 Years of Political Dedication and Sacrifice; Honouring Our Heroes, Preserving Our Legacy, Securing Our Future Through Victory\u201d held at the Hilton Alexandria Mark Center, located at 5000 Seminary Road, Alexandria, he challenged the diasporan branches of the party to live up to this bill. \u201cWe can only break the 8 when we show seriousness in the election and just as you have been during, the party will rely on our diaspora branches particularly the United States to ensure that Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia elected President to help develop the country.\u201d He urged He indicated that the NPP cannot hand over power to the NDC for the sake of Ghanaians. \u201cWe need to win this election for the sake of our dear country Ghana because Ghanaians have only one choice and that choice is the NPP.\u201d He stressed. He called on Ghanaians to vote for a President who will be accountable to them and not a one-term President. \u201cShould Dr. Bawumia become President, he would have another term to come back to the people to seek reelection but the same cannot be said about Mr. Mahama who is coming for just 4 years, so we cannot put our destiny into his hands\u201d, he argued.", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdoYW5hd2ViLmNvbS9HaGFuYUhvbWVQYWdlL05ld3NBcmNoaXZlL0xldC1zLXdpbi0yMDI0LXBvbGxzLWZvci10aGUtc2FrZS1vZi1HaGFuYS1KRkstY2hhbGxlbmdlcy1OUFAtVVNBLTE5MzI3MDDSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Let's win 2024 polls for the sake of Ghana \u2013 JFK challenges NPP -USA</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">GhanaWeb</font>", "url": "https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Let-s-win-2024-polls-for-the-sake-of-Ghana-JFK-challenges-NPP-USA-1932700", "image": "https://cdn.ghanaweb.com/imagelib/src/Justin_Kodua_jfk.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:35:01", "author": "Dr Mahamudu Bawumia", "authors": ["Dr Mahamudu Bawumia"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.112}

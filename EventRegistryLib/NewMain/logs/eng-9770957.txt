An extensive search for the boy continued through Sunday, when his body surfaced in the park at Bohrer Park at 5:25 pm.\"\n\nThe statement said, \"Montgomery County Police Managed Search Operations Team personnel, who were coordinating the search, responded to the pond and recovered the body, which has been positively identified as Fawzan Hassan.\"\n\nMontgomery County Police, Maryland National Capital Park Police, Gaithersburg Police, Maryland State Police, Montgomery Country Fire and Rescue Services, and the Mid-Atlantic Dog Search and Rescue all worked to search the area. The Montgomery County Police thanked these divisions in the statement that it shared.\n\nPolice said the family had been notified and that Hassan's body had been transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to determine the exact cause of death.\n\nIn a Facebook Live interview posted to the police force's page, the police chief said, \"We all had been hoping for a different outcome, however, the body of 6-year-old Fawzan Hassan has been recovered.\"\n\nHassan's body was found in the same park he went missing in. In the interview, police confirmed that the pond where his body was found is roughly 50 yards away from the park where he went missing.\n\nThe police said Hassan was found by a member of the public. Community members saw the body and \"alerted another officer who got on the radar, and we all responded as quickly as we could.\"\n\nThe case will be handled by the Major Crimes Division moving forward, it said. When asked if that indicated any foul play, the police said: \"No, it's just their realm of responsibility when we get to this level, unfortunately, that they take it over.\"\n\nThe police were questioned at multiple points in the interview about the body being found in the pond and prior search efforts. The police said that \"as far as ruling out that somebody's in there, a lot of the times we have to wait to see if we get something that comes to the surface.\"\n\nThe police were quizzed on the methods it used to search the pond and the resources it had used including divers. The police said it had consulted with divers, but there were issues with the terrain in the pond, including the presence of snapping turtles, which made searching it harder.\n\nWhen asked what the force would say to parents in the wake of the news, the officer stated, \"It's a tough thing to say to anyone in this situation but I just know as a parent myself, your heads gotta be on a swivel, you have to constantly be watching and it's even harder when you have a child with special needs.\"\n\nWhat's Next\n\n\"We ask that the community respect the family's privacy as they mourn the loss of their child,\" the police said.\n\nThe Montgomery County Police Department shared a resource on its Facebook page, suggesting that users visit the Autism/IDD unit website for wandering safety resources, suggestions, and unit officer contact info.\n\nAccording to the CDC, drowning is the number one cause of death for children who have Autism Spectrum Disorder.", "source": {"uri":

There is no indication of foul play at this time.\n\n\"We are grateful for the tireless efforts of our search teams ... and the many volunteers and community members who assisted in the search.

The department also asked the local community to continue assistance in finding the child.\n\nAmong other requests, police asked residents keep an eye out for Hassan in public areas, as well as checking their backyards and other places he may have sought shelter around their properties.\n\nOusman Seid, a leader with the Ethiopian Silt'e community group hosting the picnic, said the group had been helping in the search for the child and had offered their own $10,000 reward.\n\n\"This was our event, we think we are responsible and we didn't have any sleep,\" Seid said. \"We felt we have to do this, and the money really didn't matter,\" he added.\n\nSearch teams worked overnight Saturday into Sunday searching for Hassan, using drones with the assistance of Maryland National Capital Police in Montgomery County, as well as canines from the Mid Atlantic Dogs search teams.\n\nBefore the end of the news conference, Hedgepeth addressed the parents in the community, many of whom had been a part of the search.\n\n\"As a parent myself, your head's got to be on a swivel. You have to constantly be watching. And it's even harder when you have a child with special needs,\" said Hedgepeth. \"Keep watching those children, keep your eyes and focus on them as much as you can.

He is the one who spotted Fawzan in the water.\n\n\"I got out of my car and I started walking down. Everything was business as usual, you know, but I know as a parent of an autistic kid, the first place you want to go is to the water. So I walked right along here and there was a gentleman standing looking at the water and he motioned to me and I ran over and I looked down and that was the, the child was, was there in the water. I did not expect to show up here and then you see the kid in the water,\" he said.\n\nMontgomery County Police said earlier in the day that teams did search the pond via drones and canines. WJLA learned that divers did not get in the water.\n\n\"We had consulted with divers with my understanding. I asked that question as well because we did have the boats out with fire rescue. My understanding there was issues with snapping turtles being in this lake. So it was something we could have circled back around to had we needed to. But my understanding was because of that and some of the terrain in there, it would have been a little harder to do that,\" Hedgepeth said.\n\nAccording to the department, visibility was also an issue.\n\nAs saddened family members sat by the water crying and holding each other visibly in pain by the loss of their little boy, Nightingale said he will be holding his child on the spectrum a little closer.\n\n\"Yeah, it's fearful. I'm afraid,\" Nightingale said.\n\nPolice said there is no foul play suspected at this time.\n\nAuthorities do not know how long Fawzan had been in the water before he was seen.", "source": {"uri": "wbrc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://www.wbrc.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Autism spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaithersburg,_Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaithersburg, Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaithersburg, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohrer_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bohrer Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_County_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montgomery County Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Springs,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver Springs, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Silver Springs, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelydridae", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelydridae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WJLA-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WJLA-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://gray-wbrc-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/TOBGV5XPQRCYTG7MEXFOWPTRTQ.jpg?auth=65972928c1b686335ef855a95585ec23f387760bacf2230aa16405189710e833&width=1200&height=600&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9770957", "eventUri": "eng-9770957", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaithersburg, Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

(7News) -- Detectives recovered the body of a missing 6-year-old boy after an intense search that lasted for more than 24 hours in Gaithersburg, Maryland.\n\nThe body of Fawzan Hassan was found Sunday in a pond in Bohrer Park, where the young boy and his family spent some time the day before.\n\nOn Saturday, Hassan, who was reportedly non-verbal and autistic, and his family were at the park enjoying a community event when he suddenly went missing. The young boy was supposedly playing in the playground before he disappeared.\n\nHassan's family immediately contacted the Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD). Officers responded to the park and began their search for the little boy.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, more than 200 people joined in on the search for the missing child. Officials said that several agencies including the Gaithersburg City Police Department and Maryland State Police worked to locate Hassan. Volunteer groups within the community also began assisting, officials said.\n\nOfficials said that the team searched the pond, where Hassan was found, via drones, canines, and other measures. But, divers never got in the water, according to Lieutenant Kristina Hedgepeth with the Special Victims Bureau. Officials claimed visibility was also an issue in the water.\n\nOn Sunday, Neal Nightingale, a parent of an autistic child residing in Silver Spring, Maryland, said he joined in on the search, wanting to help. That is when he said he spotted Hassan.\n\n\"I got out of my car and I started walking down.

The Crown star, 28, and Bohemian Rhapsody actor Rami, 43, were deep in conversation as they leant up against a bar on Worthy Farm. It comes after it was reported earlier this month the couple thought to have taken their relationship to the next level by 'moving in together' - and friends claim an engagement could be on the cards. Emma - who identifies as non-binary and uses they/them pronouns - cut a cool figure in a fitted grey hoodie and yellow trousers with buckled boots. The Kent-born actor, kept low-key as they wore a pair of dark sunglasses and a black baseball while enjoying the legendary festival. Meanwhile the James Bond star- whose friends have said they wouldn't be surprised if he proposed soon - tried to cover up as much as possible in a black hooded jumper which he wore over up and over a baseball cap. He teamed it with beige trousers and a pair of brown boots. Rami also opted for some dark sunglasses. Later on in the day the pair were spotted walking around the site, linking arms. Their appearance comes after it was revealed they are living together - and after their friends hinted that an engagement could be on the cards. The pair are thought to have taken their relationship to the next level by 'moving in together'. They have been together for just under a year but friends have now claimed the couple are living together. A source told The Sun: 'They have got a \u00a35million house together in London and moved in together a few weeks ago. 'Rami and Emma are both really serious about each other. Even though they've only been dating for 11 months they are moving quickly because for them, this relationship feels like forever. 'Their friends have said they wouldn't be surprised if Rami proposed soon.' MailOnline contacted their representatives for comment at the time. Rami and Emma are thought to have begun dating last summer and made their relationship official when they were spotted kissing during an outing in London in September. Before dating Emma, Rami was in a relationship with Lucy Boynton, who played Freddie Mercury's girlfriend Mary Austin in Bohemian Rhapsody. Lucy and Rami confirmed their relationship in 2019 but had apparently split by 2022 when he was spotted out with French screen siren L\u00e9a Seydoux. L\u00e9a and Rami, who both featured in that year's James Bond film, No Time To Die, were seen in the December with their arms around one another. However by the following summer, rumours began to fly about a blossoming romance between Rami and Emma, with sources dishing about their 'loved-up dates'. They were observed kissing over lunch in Margate, Kent, and 'didn't seem to mind who could see' them at their alfresco table. 'They were very passionate and looking into each other's eyes,' said a source who caught sight of them at the restaurant. 'Rami and Emma just seemed totally besotted with each other and paid no attention to anyone else.' Emma, who won the Golden Globe For Best Actress - Television Series Drama months before adopting 'they/them' pronouns, explained the swap to the Guardian. 'Because I was working on a film in the US, away from everyone who knows me, and when people called me she, it felt so weird and uncomfortable,' said the thespian.", "summary": "The Crown star, 28, and Bohemian Rhapsody actor Rami, 43, seemed in good spirits as they were spotted at Glastonbury festival on Friday.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13581893/Emma-Corrin-Rami-Malek-Glastonbury.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/29/00/86717517-0-image-m-39_1719617355450.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/11/30/3191908007630489959/1024x576_MP4_3191908007630489959.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:12:26", "author": "Editor,Ruth Francis", "authors": ["Editor", "Ruth Francis"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.003}

{"id": 225044302, "title": "Meet the Gen Zers maxing out their retirement savings: 'It's no longer chasing money; it's chasing time'", "text": "Young professionals have more access to personal finance advice than ever, and \"are very aware of opportunities they need to take advantage of and want to make sure they're not being left behind,\" Thombley says. Much like the workplace and career path in general, Gen Zers are redefining what retirement looks like to them. \"People expect their career journey will look different from their parents,\" she says. \"Everyone has a sense of what their end of career looks like for them, and [Gen Zers] are thinking about that from day one, which is an interesting shift.\" As for her retirement goals, Zhang is still figuring it out but feels secure she'll have the funds to dream big. As she sees it, her choices come down to saving aggressively now to have flexibility in the future, and having \"the choice to do things you want to do without being down to money.\" Hinckley feels similarly and says saving for retirement doesn't have to come at a major sacrifice. \"A lot of people think saving toward retirement means you don't get to enjoy life right now,\" she says. \"Even though I'm aggressively saving for retirement and investing in real estate, I live a life I love.\" She sees her retirement goals as a redefining her own American dream of \"having your time back and not making someone else rich.\" That might mean building her own business or passive income streams rather than working a corporate job. Plus, Hinckley adds, \"I don't want to wait to do [my hobbies] when I'm 70.\" \"It's no longer chasing money,\" she says. \"It's chasing time.\" Want to land your dream job?

Football supporters long to see their teams back in action, keenly awaiting pre-season friendlies for their sporting fix. Around these parts, you're likely of a Villa, Blues, Albion or Wolves persuasion, but at Edgbaston, you sit side by side. After the misery of May, the Bears have been granted pleasant weather so far in June. Following the success of Blast Off a week ago, Durham - who were comprehensively swept aside on their own patch as the Bears kicked off their campaign eight days ago - were the visitors. What you can only hope for on days like these, when sports fans and families fill their time by congregating at Edgbaston, is good weather - and we mercifully had it. The Bears lost narrowly at Old Trafford on Friday night. After a dreadful powerplay, they impressively dragged it back in the middle overs thanks in no small part to Jake Lintott's contribution. They took the chase as deep as possible, due largely to the partnership of Sam Hain and Jacob Bethell, but they fell short. You can join our Bears Facebook page by clicking here! Without Richard Gleeson, with whom they were taking precautions, Aamer Jamal was handed his Blast debut, but Gleeson's fellow newbie George Garton struck immediately when he tempted Graham Clark into the safe hands of Jake Lintott in the covers. That brought David Bedingham to the crease right away. His supreme batting was the best of both worlds. The Durham no.3 crashed three huge sixes in his knock of 63 from just 27 deliveries - which included a 21-ball half century - but he also played some highly attractive cricket shots, including one straight back past the outstretched arm of the bowling Garton. Even after Bedingham had departed, when he clipped Lintott into the mitts of Rob Yates, his middle order cohorts picked up the baton of responsibility. Ollie Robinson also fell victim to Lintott before Ben Raine was clean bowled by Dan Mousley, but Ashton Turner hung around long enough to make a useful 33 prior to hooking Garton to the watchful Danny Briggs at short fine leg. For much of Durham's innings, they looked destined to comfortably pass 200 - which would meant doubling their total managed against the Bears a little over a week ago - but they fell just short after a lot of effort from the hosts. Nevertheless, a total of 194 was an intimidating enough figure to try and chase down. Just as the day had begun, there was a wicket in the first over. Yates departed for just one, but the Bears these days do tend to remain consistent in their application and they sent out Mousley at no.3 with that precise intention. The powerplay was a fun one, made up of ten boundaries including two maximums as Alex Davies and Mousley shared a quickfire half century partnership. When Mousley was trapped in front and Davies was stumped well clear of his ground, though, the Bears again turned to Hain and Bethell, but the brakes were applied. Hain then holed out to long off for just nine and Chris Benjamin (bumped down to six) didn't fare much better when he was clean bowled by Raine, who completed Jamal's miserable afternoon when he dismissed him for a golden duck. Bethell continued on defiantly, and briefly he was joined in the big-hitting fun by Garton. The pair took it in turns to loft Nathan Sowter towards the Hollies stand and clear of the rope, but the former eventually made way for an earnest 50 as he attempted another big swing with the Bears up against it. Ali followed the very next ball. The tail regrettably fell away meekly. Raine finished with mightily impressive figures of 5/21 from the 22 deliveries he bowled, as he ripped right through the middle order. The Bears, with flawless stats a week ago, have experienced an entirely different weekend this and they now welcome Yorkshire next Friday night needing to get their campaign back on track.", "summary": "Bears were two from two in the T20 Blast, but they've lost back to back matches this weekend and their campaign is now in the balance", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/cricket/bears-succumb-successive-defeats-despite-29319482", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/cricket/article29319413.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2155224037.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:25:59", "author": "Joseph Chapman", "authors": ["Joseph Chapman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.086}

And it is against Ginebra, no less,\" said NLEX head coach Frankie Lim in a mix of Filipino and English. \"They played their hearts out.\"\n\nThe win, though, did not come without a scare.\n\nBolick erupted for 13 points in the third quarter to help the Road Warriors build a 59-54 advantage, then drained a booming three-pointer with under eight minutes left that gave his side their biggest lead of the game at 71-58.\n\nGinebra, however, clawed its way back and unloaded a 14-2 run capped by a pair of Maverick Ahanmisi free throws to pull within 72-73 with 30 seconds remaining.\n\nA split from the free throw line by NLEX guard Baser Amer kept the door ajar for the Gin Kings, 74-72, but the Road Warriors put the shackles on Ginebra and forced Von Pessumal to cough up a turnover during an inbound play.\n\nRichie Rodger sealed the win by draining his foul shots.\n\n\"We should have handled our last five minutes a lot better,\" said Lim. \"But just the same, my guys did not give up. We locked them up. We denied all entry passes and they turned the ball over.\"\n\nRodger finished with 11 points - the only other NLEX player in double figures - on top of 6 rebounds, while Michael Miranda and Anthony Semerad chipped in 8 points apiece and combined for 11 rebounds.\n\nChristian Standhardinger paced the Gin Kings with 19 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists, although he sat out the last seven minutes as Ginebra head coach Tim Cone opted to go with a different endgame rotation.\n\nAside from Standhardinger, Cone also benched Scottie Thompson for the entire fourth quarter, with the former MVP ending up with just 4 points on top of 6 rebounds and 6 assists.\n\nJapeth Aguilar netted 15 points and Ahanmisi added 14 points in the loss, which dropped the Gin Kings to a 7-4 record.\n\nWhile Ginebra remained at No. 2, the defeat caused Magnolia to fall to No. 7 as the sister teams found themselves in an early playoff collision, with the twice-to-beat Gin Kings hoping to make quick work of the Hotshots.\n\nThe result of the game also prevented Terrafirma from clinching its first quarterfinal spot in eight years.\n\nInstead, the Dyip will face NorthPort in a do-or-die match for the eighth and last playoff seat on Wednesday, May 8, at the same venue.\n\nNLEX 76 - Bolick 25, Rodger 11, Herndon 9, Miranda 8, Semerad 8, Amer 7, Anthony 4, Marcelo 4, Fajardo 0, Valdez 0, Taha 0.\n\nBarangay Ginebra 72 - Standhardinger 19, J.

NLEX kept a two-point cushion after a Baser Amer split from the foul line before banking on its defense in the final possession when the Road Warriors forced the Kings to a turnover on the inbound pass with 3.3 seconds left.\n\nRobert Bolick took the cudgels when nothing seemed to be going for NLEX early on, finishing with 25 points, eight assists and six rebounds. Outside Bolick, there was literally no one for the Road Warriors with Richie Rodger the only other double-digit scorer with 11.\n\nStill, that was enough for NLEX to arrest a four-game losing skid before the playoffs.\n\nChristian Standhardinger still led the way with 19 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists despite not playing anymore in the final six minutes of the contest. Japeth Aguilar had 15 while Ahanmisi had 14.\n\nAt the end of the eliminations, the playoff picture is now almost complete with the eighth and final spot in the quarterfinals the only slot yet to be determined.

Now, they need to survive a KO game and get the help of other teams just to get to the quarterfinals outright.\n\nThe Road Warriors will have to deal with powerhouse Barangay Ginebra in the 6:15 p.m. nightcap at Ninoy Aquino Stadium where they will need to gut out a win to avoid being put at a disadvantage.\n\nOne scenario of NLEX advancing outright was already shelved after Meralco denied San Miguel Beer an 11-game sweep of the eliminations with a 95-92 win in Batangas City Saturday.\n\nNLEX is tied with TNT, which has an identical 5-5 record, with the Tropang Giga's playoff shot coming against quarterfinalist Magnolia in Sunday's opener at 3:15 p.m.\n\nTerrafirma and NorthPort are waiting to see if they will be back on Wednesday for the playoff or prepare for the quarters after ending the eliminations with similar 5-6 slates. The results of the remaining games will determine their respective fates.\n\n\"We still have a chance and anything can happen,\" Bolick said. \"These string of losses has been very ugly and we need to fix it. We have to give our all this Sunday and not let this opportunity slip away.\"\n\nLost chance\n\nNLEX shot itself in the foot -- and could have already gotten a quarters berth a few weeks ago against TNT in an out-of-town game in Candon, Ilocos Sur, -- by squandering a double-digit lead in the fourth.\n\nTheir next three games bore miserable results, with the Road Warriors falling to Phoenix by 35 points, San Miguel Beer by 17 and Rain or Shine by 16 two nights ago.\n\nThe Road Warriors' 120-104 loss to the Elasto Painters, who in the process clinched a quarters berth, at PhilSports Arena in Pasig City ended hopes of the twice-to-beat bonus while allowing Ginebra to clinch the other incentive without the Kings breaking a sweat.\n\nMeanwhile, Blackwater thrashed Phoenix, 102-83, in a nonbearing game Saturday at Ynares Sports Arena in Pasig City.\n\nThat allowed the Bossing to snap a seven-game skid and end the conference with a 4-7 record while the Fuel Masters concluded their own

And for a good reason.\n\n\"We'll have a lot of thinking to do about Meralco,\" he said in Filipino on the heels of a 76-72 escape act against Barangay Ginebra that night at Ninoy Aquino Stadium in Malate, Manila.\n\n\"Especially after [the Bolts'] win over San Miguel. It seems that their game is changing, particularly their bigs,\" he added. \"That's one key factor that we'll have to look at.\"\n\nMeralco, hobbling throughout this all-Filipino, dealt the red-hot Beermen their first loss in the tournament a couple of nights ago in a duel in Batangas City, putting an end to the vaunted club's 10-game tear and denying the defending champions what could've been the first sweep of the elimination phase in the modern PBA.\n\nAnd as Lim pointed out, it was the Bolts' front line that made such a victory possible. Cliff Hodge, the club's tireless forward, put up 20 points and 13 rebounds to lead the way against a June Mar Fajardo-led side eager to end its own elimination round schedule with a bang. Center Raymond Almazan was just as big, especially with his 10 boards, while swingmen Bong Quinto and Allein Maliksi chipped in with double-digit scores of their own.\n\nBut Robert Bolick, the NLEX top gun who topscored with 25 in that conquest of the Gin Kings, pointed out that Meralco's strength shouldn't be measured solely on that road victory.\n\n\"Meralco's tough,\" he said. \"I think they're the only [squad] who beat all the strong teams in this conference. And they're a good defensive team, too. Sure they may be undermanned without Aaron (Black) ... but I know a lot of guys out there will be stepping up.\"\n\nPredicament\n\nMeralco, which touts a 6-5 win-loss mark, outlasted Rain or Shine in overtime, dismantled the crowd darlings and beat Magnolia in its own defensive game all before stunning San Miguel. Like Lim, Barangay Ginebra coach Tim Cone could still barely process the predicament his squad just put itself in.\n\nThe loss to the Road Warriors put the Gin Kings' on a collision course with corporate sibling Magnolia -- a face-off that the seasoned mentor never thought would come this soon.\n\n\"I mean, if we could've avoided Magnolia we certainly would have. But we couldn't,\" he told reporters on his way out of the venue. \"We would have [wanted] facing them later in the tournament, and not having to knock each other out this early.\" \"But you don't really have control over that.\"\n\nMaking things doubly heavier for Cone is the fact that Maverick Ahanmisi hurt his right shoulder in the dying moments of the game -- a worrying sight for the Gin Kings, who are still coping without injured forward Jamie Malonzo.\n\n\"I was running for the rebound and then (Tony) Semerad ran, pulled my arm back. That's what happened. My arm kind of went numb,\" the crafty guard said.\n\n\"I guess we'll see in the next couple of days how much better it gets. But I'm just going to keep icing it and do treatment,\" he added.

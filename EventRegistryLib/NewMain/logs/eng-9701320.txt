I'm at that point in my career where I've seen enough ball and I know myself that I can go out there and play as well as anybody in the game. The biggest strides this year are going to be my body and learning how to get through the season, get through practices with my body, and feeling tip, top shape. And so that's the main focus for the off-season.\"\n\nStay healthy, and a Burrow-led Bengals should win the AFC North, as they have in his only two full seasons. Learning to play the piano has been a nice development in that goal.\n\n\"I'm learning the piano right now, hopefully, I can get pretty good at that by next offseason,\" Burrow noted again about the new hobby. \"I guess it'll be pretty tough during the season, but it's helped my rehab too for my wrist, so that's something I want to get good at... I've always wanted to learn how to play, but this was an opportune time to work on my hand and wrist dexterity while also learning that.

The quarterback sat down for an interview with Complex Sports recently and discussed how he doesn't believe in top-five QB lists.\n\nBurrow has a strong case as one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\n\"I'm going to stay away from that one,\" Burrow said about his top-five quarterbacks. \"There's so many good ones. But I mean, I think we were just talking about it earlier, there's so many good ones right now that it's just an exciting time because there's so many guys that are playing the game at a high level. And like I said, diverse skill sets are a lot of fun to watch.\n\n\"So I don't like lists like that because I feel like it takes away from certain people's accomplishments and there's not just a top five of all time. There's not just a top five in the game right now and it can change week to week. The guy that's the best one Sunday isn't going to be the best next Sunday. So many ups and downs. I just think that those lists aren't really serving anybody. There've been so many great quarterbacks that have paved the way for other great quarterbacks to come after them. So I think those lists kind of take away from that.\"\n\nBurrow has gone from rookie in prove-it mode, to one of the league's best players midway through the decade. In the end, none of these lists matter at all.\n\nThe Lombardi Trophy matters and only two active QBs have lifted one since he entered the NFL.\n\nBookmark Bengals Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!

Matt Miller has Cincinnati taking Texas WR Isaiah Bond with the 25th pick.\n\n\"Tee Higgins may have signed his franchise-tag tender, but that doesn't mean the Bengals have a long-term resolution yet for the talented WR2,\" Miller wrote. \"The Bengals drafted Jermaine Burton to replace Tyler Boyd but could still have receiver high on the list of needs during the next draft. Bond, a transfer from Alabama, will fill the Xavier Worthy role in the Texas offense with his elite downfield speed. He averaged 13.9 yards per catch with four touchdowns last season, even as the Alabama offense struggled to find consistency in the pass game. And in Steve Sarkisian's system, Bond has huge potential.\"\n\nPicking 25th would be a massive disappointment in the final season before Joe Burrow's salary cap hit goes above $30 million for the rest of his current contract.\n\nBookmark Bengals Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!

Pitcher may have been the effective third in command -- behind head coach Zac Taylor and Callahan -- in orchestrating the Bengals' offense, but he still did tremendous work with Joe Burrow,\" Locker wrote. \"Moreover, the fact that Jake Browning played solidly, earning a 79.3 overall grade, in Burrow's place last year speaks volumes about the Bengals' offensive scheme and Pitcher's abilities.\n\n\"Cincy's offense won't be able to lean as heavily on the now-departed Joe Mixon, but the elements are in place for a turnaround from a unit that ranked 15th in offensive grade last season. With the return of Burrow and stud receiver Tee Higgins, plus two good additions in running back Zack Moss and tight end Mike Gesicki, expect more offensive humming from Cincinnati -- and with it, consideration for the 37-year-old Pitcher.\"\n\nThe new ideas and fresh voice from Pitcher could be what Cincinnati needs to diversify its attack and win the AFC this coming season.\n\nBookmark Bengals Talk for the latest news, exclusive interviews, film breakdowns and so much more!

Louisiana fans, there's not as much to cheer for. You have the Saints and you have the Tigers, and in Ohio, you can spread yourself a little more thin.\"\n\nBurrow did tip the weather cap to Ohio.\n\n\"I like seasons, so I would say Ohio has better weather.

After a season-ending wrist surgery and a torn ACL a few seasons back, one can understand the hesitations. That also allows this talented Bengals team to enter the season with less weight on their shoulders.\n\nIn a recent article by Mike Jones of The Athletic, he tabbed the Bengals as a team being underrated entering the year.\n\n\"With a healthy Joe Burrow, the return of top receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, an upgraded offensive line (a pressing area of need), and a reimagined offense after the elevation of quarterbacks coach Dan Pitcher to coordinator -- the Bengals seem to have a good shot at reclaiming their spot among the AFC's elite. They might pose the biggest threat to the Kansas City Chiefs' quest to win a third straight Super Bowl,\" writes Jones.\n\nBurrow's health seems to be close to (if not already back) 100%.

The Bengals drafted Jermaine Burton to replace Tyler Boyd but could still have receiver high on the list of needs during the next draft. Bond, a transfer from Alabama, will fill the Xavier Worthy role in the Texas offense with his elite downfield speed. He averaged 13.9 yards per catch with four touchdowns last season, even as the Alabama offense struggled to find consistency in the pass game. And in Steve Sarkisian's system, Bond has huge potential.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is a fool's errand to rule out anything in an upcoming draft, especially this far out.\n\nBut the Bengals have poured many resources into wideout over the last two years. Both rookie Jermaine Burton and sophomore Andrei Iosivas could be eventual Tee Higgins replacements on the boundary, while sophomore Charlie Jones could eat snaps in the slot.\n\nEven so, a speedy, field-stretching wideout is also something the team could end up needing, so who knows?

The teams have met 5 times in this decade, with Cincinnati leading the series 3-2. This competitive edge has fielded palpable tension between the players and their respective franchises. Joe gave us a visual demonstration of this animosity when he flipped a bird during a picture with a Chiefs fan.\n\nHowever, that moment backfired when a fan who saw that pic took to X(formerly Twitter) to share a blast from the past. She dug up some old childhood pictures of Burrow clad in the Chiefs merchandise. Two photos from his teenage years show him happily wearing a Kansas City T-shirt, while another from his pre-pubescent days shows him wearing a Chiefs helmet.\n\nThis revelation contradicts the image Burrow projects and how the Bengals fans perceive this rivalry. Joe \"Shiesty\" boasts a 3-1 record against the Chiefs and hopes to continue his winning run when the two teams face off again next season.\n\nBurrow will be back healthy after missing the latter half of the season due to torn ligaments in his right wrist. He has since had surgery and will be ready to go when the season starts. Meanwhile, Mahomes is coming off another Super Bowl campaign. However, as always, the Chiefs' match-up against the Bengals will present a tough challenge for the defending champions.\n\nKansas City starts its season on the 5th of September against the Ravens at Arrowhead, while Cincinnati opens theirs on the 8th of September against the Patriots. The highly anticipated clash between the Chiefs and Bengals is set for Week 2, on September 15th, with Cincinnati traveling to Kansas City to face the defending champs at Arrowhead.\n\nThe Bengals lost this fixture 18-16, ending their playoff hopes. With Burrow out due to injury, his record against the Chiefs remains 3-1. Both teams won't face each other again unless they meet in the playoffs, as they did in the 2021 and 2022 AFC Championship games.\n\nJoe's focus will be on making the playoffs out of one of the toughest divisions in the NFL. While this rivalry is significant, it might be just another game for Mahomes who has his sights set on winning another Lombardy Trophy and achieving a three-peat.\n\nIt's time for Burrow to do the same for his franchise and show that he is still worth the hype by taking the Bengals to another Super Bowl and winning it this time around.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayush_juneja@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Ayush Juneja", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_rivalry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "College rivalry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrowhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-peat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-peat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lombardy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lombardy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lombardy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/04/0b93527c-untitled-design-2024-04-24t202234.346.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701320", "eventUri": "eng-9701320", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-05", "textStart": 1429, "textEnd": 1445}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-08", "textStart": 1516, "textEnd": 1532}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-15", "textStart": 1637, "textEnd": 1651}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

And the three Bengals included in the rankings didn't just make the list. They are all ranked in the top 35 of Prisco's rankings.\n\nPrisco's highest-ranked Bengal on the list is Ja'Marr Chase, who checks in at No. 13. Chase is the third-highest receiver in Prisco's rankings, behind only Justin Jefferson and Tyreek Hill, and is up three spots from his spot on Prisco's list in 2023.\n\nThe Bengals' third-year wide receiver had a career-high 100 catches in 2023, and that's with Joe Burrow missing the last seven games of the season. Chase compiled 1,216 receiving yards to go along with seven touchdowns. He is in line for a contract extension, but it's not yet clear whether he and the Bengals will reach that extension before or after the 2024 Season.\n\nJoe Burrow checks in at No. 15 on the list, the third-highest quarterback on the list behind only Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes. Burrow being ranked at No. 15, despite missing the last seven games of the season, shows the respect Prisco has for him and the level Burrow plays at when he is on the field. Burrow threw for 15 touchdowns in nine+ games in 2023 while completing 66.8 percent of his passes for 2,309 yards.\n\nThe other Bengal on the list is Trey Hendrickson, who checks in at No. 33 on the list. Only Chris Jones, Maxx Crosby, Nick Bosa, and Myles Garrett rank ahead of Hendrickson in the defensive ends on Prisco's list.\n\nIn his third season with the Bengals, Hendrickson had a career year. The three-time Pro Bowler had 17.5 sacks, 25 quarterback hits, and 16 tackles for loss. Hendrickson also forced three fumbles for the third consecutive season. Prisco has Hendrickson ranked 58 spots higher than he had him in 2023, jumping from No. 91 to No. 33.\n\nTee Higgins was included in the Honorable Mention category after the Top 100 Players, the only Bengal to be included in that category.", "source": {"uri": "cincyjungle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincy Jungle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ja'Marr_Chase", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ja'Marr Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Top_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Top 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreek_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyreek Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxx_Crosby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maxx Crosby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jones_(defensive_tackle,_born_1994)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trey_Hendrickson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trey Hendrickson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7JnvBRbcuC_MAGCfQ2teHNsiC_0=/0x294:3000x1794/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25512378/usa_today_22046006.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9701320", "eventUri": "eng-9701320", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-22", "textStart": 128, "textEnd": 137}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory minicamp is over, and training camp hasn't yet begun. The players have all, for the most part, gone home, and they're doing their own things.\n\nSo, until there's something to talk about, here's our latest 53-man roster prediction for the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nSeriously. I don't think one of the undrafted guys they brought in this year will take Evans' spot. I just wonder if the Bengals will keep three or four running backs. If Evans isn't going to contribute in any way, run with three.\n\nFor now, though, I'll say they roll with a committee where Moss, Brown and Williams all contribute, and the team goes with the hot hand when it presents itself.\n\nNotes: I think this is your six unless there's an injury or Jones struggles and one of the other guys like Shedrick Jackson goes off in training camp and preseason.\n\nNotes: This is tough. I thought about keeping five tight ends, so there's a spot for Tanner McLachlan. All seems as though he'll be recovered and ready for training camp after his ACL injury. If that's true, I think the above is your four, and McLachlan lands on the practice squad.\n\nNotes: The Bengals come into the 2024 season with the best offensive line they've had in the Joe Burrow era. With the added muscle/injury insurance of Mims and the versatility of Ford and Carman, the offensive line could finally be a strength of the team.\n\nNotes: The Bengals lost DJ Reader to both injury and free agency. In 2023, it showed when he was out of the lineup. The defensive line is rebuilt now, with the additions of Rankins to add some pass-rushing juice in the interior, and Jenkins and Jackson, added in the draft, hopefully help the defensive front play better against the run. The Bengals face Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren, Nick Chubb, Jerome Ford, and now Derrick Henry in their own division, and each team is going to want to run early and often to keep Joe off the field. They'll need to be able to stop the run.\n\nNotes: The linebackers are pretty much set. Wilson and Pratt will be on the field more often than not. Lou Anarumo typically keeps the team in nickel, with Mike Hilton acting as the team's third linebacker. ADG will be the primary backup, and Bachie will contribute to special teams. Keeping only four linebackers is a risk, but I think the Bengals have questions on the defensive line and in the secondary, and they'd rather keep some more bodies at those positions.\n\nNotes: CTB returns as the team's top corner. Hilton will still dominate the box as the slot corner, and the other side will likely be Turner, last year's second-round pick. They also have Hill, the converted safety, to insert somewhere. Davis is the slot backup, while Ivey and Newton round out the room.\n\nNotes: The Hill experiment didn't work, thus the move to corner. However, Battle, who fell to the Bengals in the third round last season, was a very nice surprise. The Bengals brought in a rising star in Stone and a familiar face in Bell, and Anderson is hoping to stay healthy and contribute.\n\nThis room should be the most improved from the 2023 to the 2024 season.\n\nNotes: McPherson and Adomitis are locks, and I'm going with McNamara because why not? Brad Robbins wasn't good in 2023, but this is far from a lock. Punters aren't paid enough for this to come down to money. If Robbins makes some improvements, I expect the Bengals to keep him. If he doesn't, well.......\n\n--\n\nWho did I forget to add to the roster?

That's why he says his biggest goal has everything to do with his availability.\n\n\"Well, number one, I want to be on the field for all the games,\" he told Complex Sports. \"I know I'm going to play well when I'm out there. I'm at that point in my career where I've seen enough to know myself that I can go out there and play as well as anybody in the game. The biggest strides this year are going to be my body and learning how to get through the season, get through practices with my body, and feeling in tip-top shape. And so that's the main focus for the off-season.\"\n\nIn Burrow's rookie season, he went down in Week 11 against the Washington Commanders with a devastating knee injury that needed to be surgically repaired. Then, last season, Burrow was initially hampered by a calf strain suffered in training camp. As the season wore on, and just when things got going, Week 11 came (again), and Burrow's wrist was injured, once again needing to be surgically repaired.\n\nWith the best offensive line the Bengals have had in the Burrow era, the quarterback is primed to take the Bengals on another deep run into the playoffs, this time hopefully with a Super Bowl win. To get there, Burrow has taken a somewhat unique approach to rehabbing his wrist.\n\n\"I'm learning the piano right now. Hopefully, I can get pretty good at that by next offseason,\" he said. \"I guess it'll be pretty tough during the season, but it's helped my rehab too for my wrist, so that's something I want to get good at... I've always wanted to learn how to play, but this was an opportune time to work on my hand and wrist dexterity while also learning that. So it was kind of the perfect storm.\"\n\nCan't you see it?

But it is a journey into the unknown for Bengals' long-time special teams coordinator Darrin Simmons as his players made the giant leap to the field this week.\n\n\"It's invigorating to me because it's something completely different,\" said Simmons after viewing the rule for the first time deployed in practice with his own players.\n\nBorn in April of 1973, the month Major League Baseball ushered in its biggest rule change in decades in the form of the designated hitter, Simmons had yet to make it to grade school in Elkhart, Kan., when Bengals founder Paul Brown successfully urged the NFL to adopt the \"Isaac Curtis Rule.\"\n\nThat was big, Simmons agrees. Not allowing a receiver to be touched five yards past the line of scrimmage changed football's texture and accelerated the rise of the passing game. But he believes this is the biggest transformation to the sport in his lifetime.\n\n\"The chuck rule was huge, but it more of a one-trick pony,\" Simmons said. \"Here, there are a lot of factors.\"\n\nLike these:\n\n_The kicker is now penalized for drilling it into the end zone because the ball goes out to the receiving team's 30.\n\n\"I'm used to kicking it as high as I can, as hard as I can. Now I have to throw it inside to the 5-yard line in specific areas,\" says Bengals kicker Evan McPherson.\n\n_Where once speed, elusiveness, and get-off were coveted on kickoffs, everyone must freeze until the ball is caught or lands inside the 20 while the two teams are eyeballing each other in a setup just five yards apart.\n\n\"I'm used to running back 20 yards as soon as the ball is kicked and come down and make a block,\" says edge Myles Murphy. \"But now when the ball is kicked, you have to stand still, then you run back maybe five yards and find your block.\"\n\n_Any kick that hits in the last 20 yards before the end zone must be returned. Any kick that hits in those 20 yards and goes into the end zone must be returned or downed by receiving team. If it is downed then the touchback is the 20-yard line.\n\nThat means the number of returns is going to go up by about 90%.\n\n\"It really is like a line-of-scrimmage play now,\" says sixth-year running back Trayveon Williams, the Bengals' most seasoned kick returner. \"It's definitely a running back position, I feel like. It's really fit for a one-cut-and-go type of guy and once you get that first crease, you've got to hit it and go.\"\n\nBut wait a minute. Bengals wide receiver Charlie Jones, who last season became the first Cincy rookie since Peter Warrick 23 years before to return a punt for a touchdown, isn't too sure about that.\n\n\"I could also see you arguing it's kind of like a punt return. Catch the ball, find a little seam. And hit it,\" Jones says. \"I think it works either way. I think it's something that is definitely going to take time. I think you'll see people figuring out their own little new ways of doing it. You'll just have to see how it plays out in preseason.\"\n\nWhen Jones hit the Ravens on his 81-yard touchdown, he gathered in a high kick and had an instant to size up blocks from fellow rookies Andrei Iosivas and DJ Turner II before cutting into the seam.\n\nWill he have that time now or even get that kind of lofty kick?\n\n\"Who knows?\" Jones says.\n\nWhich is just about how Simmons, the NFL's longest-tenured kicking game coach, sees the experiment. He was one of those who consulted with the league office before the owners passed the rule in March and encouraged the concept of reviving the return.\n\n\"This is just our second day in helmets and I haven't even looked at the tape from today's practice,\" Simmons said of Wednesday's voluntary workout. \"So I'm not making any pronouncements.\"\n\nBut after being on the field this week, Simmons could make certain observations when it comes to personnel and strategy.\n\n\"This is just one play, so you have to balance it with the function of the rest of the team,\" said Simmons as he looked at the edge rushers. \"The Joseph Ossais, the Myles Murphys, the Cedric Johnsons, the Jeff Gunters. The tweener types. Bigger guys that can move. Those guys have added value. Now you need guys who can work edges, but also hold-the-point types.\"\n\nQuick Hits: On Day One, Bengals Defense Communicates The Message; Money Mac Adjusts To New Kickoff Rule; Joe Burrow Flashes Varied Offense Quick Hits: NFL Rewards Bengals For Top-Tier Popularity; No 'Pitch,' Count As Burrow Continues To Spin It; Bengals.com Eyes 500th Game Bengals, NFL Get Ready To Kick Off New Rule\n\nSimmons senses all kinds of kicks are going to be headed their way. Line drives. Ground balls. Bunts. You may need a DH. That's why he is sending back two returners in practice instead of the usual one.\n\n\"You have to have guys who are ball-handlers. My gut is we're going to see a lot of different styles of kicks,\" Simmons said. \"It's the way to give the kicking team the advantage. Getting the ball on the ground. Right now, based on the rule, I think the advantage is to the return team. So the kick team is going to find a way to tip the scales.\"\n\nIt certainly appears to be a design that suits Bengals running back Chase Brown because the tight formation seems to be the only line of defense. Last season as a rookie it will be recalled Brown scored his first NFL touchdown clocked at 22.05 miles per hour on his 54-yard catch-and-run screen pass, at that point second-best on the NFL GPS this season.\n\nWho would catch Brown from behind on a kick return?\n\n\"No one,\" says linebacker Akeem Davis-Gaither, a Bengals core special teamer. \"The (return) game is the easiest part. (The coverage) has no momentum to create speed. You're not worrying about a guy juking you. Now they have to play more with their hands. It's definitely made for guys with speed, making guys miss and they can get out of the gate.\n\nSafety Jordan Battle, a Simmons favorite, says the play develops so quickly, you may not have to worry if you miss a block.\n\n\"By the time you get there, the returner could be gone already,\" Battle says.\n\nThe 6-4, 263-pound Ossai says it's the Chase Browns of the world they need to stop.\n\n\"You might want to get your best guys out there regardless of injury or not. If the KOR busts out for a touchdown, it turns the game upside down,\" Ossai says. \"You're going to have to get guys you know can handle that and prevent those explosive plays. It's easier to break now. We've been watching tape and that ball can get up on the kicker pretty dang fast. You get up on the kicker like that and usually it's a touchdown.\n\n\"The emphasis on the (coverage) team is going to be on guys who handle close-quarters combat, good with striking, using their hands, shedding blocks.\"\n\nThe XFL tape shows just one kick return touchdown last season, but Murphy wonders. The returners are on a different level. Still, Simmons says, so are the coverage players. He doesn't see a raft of touchdowns. But he also says, \"We'll have to see.\"\n\nAll Trayveon Williams knows is this year he has a shot at getting as many returns as he's had in his entire five seasons. He has just 28, but he also has a solid average of 23.1 yards, 14th best among Bengals with at least 28 returns and longer than estimable returners such as David Dunn, Eric Bieniemy, and Mike Martin.\n\n\"My primary role is as a kick returner and it's a great opportunity,\" Williams says. \"Up until this year, it was a touchback league. Now I'm going to have more opportunity to help us win games. I think that's what I've been able to do. Be decisive and go.\"\n\nIt's as definitive as anybody can be right now.\n\n\"There are going to be more plays to be made this year,\" Chase Brown says. \"It's going to be explosive.\"\n\nIt's early, but this week has been enough for Simmons to see what he needs to emphasize.\n\n\"We just have to learn how to judge and balance the space or lack of space that is between us,\" Simmons said. \"It's going to be much more of a timing thing we have to get adjusted to. Things happen much faster. The blocks happen faster. The cover players are on top of the blockers much faster. Everything is happening much quicker.\"\n\nEven Armstrong had to navigate as he flew over a \"football field-sized crater,\" just before he landed.", "source": {"uri": "industriesnews.net",

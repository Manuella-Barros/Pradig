{"id": 231358586, "title": "Bipartisan Group of Senators Seeks Report on DOJ Actions Against CCP Intellectual Property Theft", "text": "A bipartisan group of senators unveiled legislation on Thursday that they say would fully inform the public of how the Justice Department responds to the national security threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). \u201cThis infiltration of our country must not be allowed to continue,\u201c she said, adding that the new bill would \u201densure that the Department of Justice is doing everything in its power to safeguard our national security.\u201d The new bill requires the attorney general to prepare a comprehensive report every year, outlining the specific measures the Justice Department implemented to thwart the CCP\u2019s efforts to steal U.S. trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property. The report should also include a breakdown of operations aimed at countering \u201cthreats from non-traditional collectors,\u201d such as researchers in laboratories, universities, and defense industrial base facilities. The CCP\u2019s theft of intellectual property cost Americans up between $225 billion to $600 billion per year, the United States Trade Representative\u2019s Office said in its 2018 report. The U.S. officials have repeatedly called out the CCP on the issue. In 2022, FBI director Christopher Wray revealed that his bureau opened a new counterintelligence case against the Chinese regime every 12 hours, and was conducting more than 2,000 investigations into the regime\u2019s attempted theft of information and technology. \u201c\u200b\u200bThere is just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, our innovation, and our economic security than China,\u201d Mr. Wray said at the time. Last September, Rep. Scott Fitzgerald (R-Wis.) introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. The bill Ms. Blackburn and Mr. Peters introduced on Thursday would go further. In addition to mandating the regular reporting of allocated resources in addressing the national security emanating from the CCP, the bill the senators introduced requires the Justice Department to detail the specific measures it implements to safeguard the civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy rights of Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely critical to both our national security and economic competitiveness that we protect U.S. intellectual property\u2014like academic research and technological innovation\u2014from being stolen and used by our adversaries,\u201d Mr. Peters, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m proud to help lead this bipartisan bill to ensure the Justice Department is protecting American ideas and innovation from threats posed by the Chinese government, while respecting Americans\u2019 privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties. This is something I\u2019ve long been focused on in the Senate and I look forward to continue working to see this bill passed into law.\u201d The measures also stipulate the report to be publicly available on the Justice Department\u2019s website. A potential classified index could be included for submission to the Senate Judiciary Committee and House of Representatives. The U.S. lawmakers\u2019 move comes amid rising concerns over the CCP\u2019s espionage campaigns in the United States and other democratic countries. These police outposts are linked to the CCP\u2019s United Front department, an agency that works to advance the regime\u2019s interests abroad, including by suppressing dissident movements, gathering intelligence, and facilitating the transfer of technology to China. Meanwhile, German prosecutors accused a longtime aide to a member of the European Parliament of passing on discussions and decisions in the assembly to the CCP\u2019s intelligence agency. The aid also allegedly works for the regime\u2019s secret service and spies on Chinese dissidents in Germany. Earlier this week, the U.S., British, Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand intelligence services warned that the CCP actively hires current and former military officers from Western countries to help bolster its military capability.", "summary": "The CCP's theft of intellectual property cost Americans up to $600 billion per year.", "url": "https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/bipartisan-group-of-senators-wants-doj-to-outline-measures-against-ccp-intellectual-property-theft-5664616", "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/06/07/id5664647-GettyImages-2149319917-2-300x180.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:17:48", "author": "Dorothy Li", "authors": ["Dorothy Li"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.103}

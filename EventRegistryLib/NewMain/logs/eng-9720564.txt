It is berthed at Waimahara Wharf in Picton and was put under a detention order.\n\nEarlier today, Maritime NZ lifted its detention notice on the Aratere, allowing it to return to service.\n\nThe internal document, which was sent to masters and deck officers on July 5, showed the vessel's autopilot was engaged as it passed Mabel Island, off Picton.\n\nThe crew on the bridge noticed the ship taking a wrong turn and tried to regain control. The document said this meant there was \"about a minute\" before crew could change the direction of the propulsion system and save the ship from running aground.\n\n\"The bridge team noticed the ship's [sudden turn] ... and correctly tried to put the steering back into hand steering mode but were unsuccessful in taking control. Around a minute passed before ... astern propulsion was utilised, however, it was too late and the vessel ran aground in Titoki Bay,\" the document read.\n\n\"The following preliminary causation is what's known at this point in the investigation process. While the process is under way and a more holistic picture of events is consolidated, it's unlikely the following causes will change significantly.\"\n\nIt was understood claims that none of the crew knew how to override the autopilot would make up part of investigations into the June 21 incident. The Post said the claims stated crew did not know they needed to press the button for five seconds to turn off the autopilot.\n\nThe document said the accidental button press \"commenced a chain of events which led to the grounding\".\n\n\"The accidental and early operation of the execute button on the starboard multipilot commenced a chain of events which led to the grounding. The reasons why recovery of controls that should have corrected this unplanned deviation were unsuccessful is part of the ongoing investigation and more information about this will be shared at a later date,\" the document read.\n\nInterislander executive general manager Duncan Roy said the safety bulletin was sent out to make sure crews across the ferry fleet knew about the incident.\n\nRoy said: \"It [the bulletin] is designed to quickly ensure crew awareness across the fleet after a serious incident, with what is known at the time. It does not replace the three full investigations (KiwiRail, Maritime NZ and [Transport Accident Investigation Commission] TAIC) into the grounding incident that are under way.\"\n\nAratere's autopilot system was not new and has been operating since 2007, he said.\n\n\"It is important that we understand all of the factors involved in the incident, including the underlying causes. A fair and thorough investigation process is crucial for all parties and is being followed.\"\n\nThe Aratere ferry suffered a reported steering failure before running aground.\n\nMaritime NZ also addressed suggestions by NZ First about what went wrong with the ferry, saying the grounding was not caused by \"a crew member leaving the bridge to make a coffee\".\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer engaged by a maritime union has dubbed the situation \"Nescaf\u00e9-gate\".\n\nMaritime NZ director Kirstie Hewlett said the regulator has inspected the ship and gathered more information over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Earlier this week, we inspected the vessel, and observed it undertake several tests while at berth involving systems, processes and equipment. Off the back of these tests we have now lifted the detention notice, but imposed conditions on the operation of the vessel.\"\n\nThis means the Aratere will gradually return to service.\n\nThe Aratere when it ran aground. Photo / Tim Cuff\n\n\"Initially, the conditions will allow crew and rail freight only [four return sailings], then trucks and their drivers, followed by a limited passenger service, and then full capacity sailings to be permitted,\" Maritime NZ said in a statement.\n\n\"The full return to service is subject to KiwiRail demonstrating it has implemented its return to service plan, and no further issues have been identified.\"\n\nInterislander executive general manager Duncan Roy said KiwiRail hoped to sail the vessel from Picton to Wellington tomorrow.\n\nNZ First, a coalition Government party, posed an \"extraordinary\" question on X yesterday about what might have caused the grounding.\n\n\"Is it true that the Aratere ran aground when someone put the autopilot on, went for a coffee, and then couldn't turn the autopilot off in time when that someone came back...?\", the party posted.\n\nMaritime NZ said its investigation would take several months and was focused on exploring a broad range of factors.\n\n\"However, while the cause of the grounding is yet to be formally determined, Maritime NZ's preliminary inquiries have found that the incident was not due to a crew member leaving the bridge to make a coffee.\"\n\nKiwiRail has also said the \"regulated number of qualified people\" were on the ship's bridge on the night of the grounding.\n\nMaritime lawyer Troy Stade, engaged by the New Zealand Merchant Service Guild union, told Newstalk ZB Drive host Heather du Plessis-Allan that the post by NZ First and Peters' comments were \"quite frankly unhelpful.\n\n\"It astounds me that the acting Prime Minister would raise an unsubstantiated rumour and conjecture in the middle of an active investigation.\n\n\"No crew went out. Nescaf\u00e9-gate, if you want to call it, is little more than unsubstantiated rumour.\"\n\nThe stricken Aratere in the Marlborough Sounds. Photo / Time Cuff\n\nLabour leader Chris Hipkins said NZ First's claim was a \"serious allegation\" and indicated Peters was not holding himself to his own standards.\n\n\"Winston Peters is the first to lambast anyone who makes an allegation that might in any way negatively reflect on him and demand that they front up immediately with the proof,\" Hipkins told the Herald.\n\n\"New Zealand First has made a pretty big allegation here and they should front up with their evidence.\"\n\nPeters has refused to comment to several media organisations, including the Herald, about what evidence his party had to support the allegation and whether it had informed investigators.\n\nPeters, who is currently the acting Prime Minister while Christopher Luxon is in the United States, did appear on The Country radio show earlier today and was asked by host Jamie Mackay where the rumour had started.\n\nPeters said he saw NZ First's social media post, which he said was not his post, and then read KiwiRail's response to it in the Herald's story.\n\n\"I thought 'Crikey, that's not a denial. That's somebody who's talking about an inquiry.' Why would you need an inquiry four weeks later into something as simple as that? This is not complicated.\"\n\nThermal drone imagery captured by Skyworks shows the moment Port Marlborough's tugs Maungatea and Monowai free the grounded Aratere.\n\nPeters said he was going to find out more about it.\n\nMackay suggested to Peters that nothing happened at NZ First without his authority. Peters said the party has a team of people.\n\nMaritime NZ inspectors will now undertake a focused audit of the Interislander fleet in the coming weeks.\n\nThis will look at Interislander's processes, procedures, training, and risk management and how it brings on new equipment and familiarises its personnel.\n\n\"Maritime NZ's inspections and audits are a reflection of a point in time, and the operator, KiwiRail, has the primary responsibility for day-to-day safe operation of the vessel, and its wider fleet,\" Hewlett said.\n\nThe investigation into the cause of the grounding is separate from the detention notice and audit.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "georgina_campbell@newstalkzb.co.nz", "name": "Georgina

The document said this meant there was \"about a minute\" before crew could change the direction of the propulsion system and save the ship from running aground.\n\nIt was understood claims that none of the crew knew how to override the autopilot would make up part of investigations into the June 21 incident. The Post said the claims stated crew did not know they needed to press the button for five seconds to turn off the autopilot.\n\nThe document said the accidental button press \"commenced a chain of events which led to the grounding\".\n\nInterislander executive general manager Duncan Roy told Stuff the safety bulletin was sent out to make sure crews across the ferry fleet knew about the incident.\n\nEarlier today, Maritime NZ lifted its detention notice on the Aratere, allowing it to return to service after it ran aground.\n\nThe regulator also addressed suggestions by NZ First about what went wrong with the ferry, saying the grounding was not caused by \"a crew member leaving the bridge to make a coffee\".\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer engaged by a maritime union has dubbed the situation \"Nescaf\u00e9-gate\".\n\nMaritime NZ director Kirstie Hewlett said the regulator has inspected the ship and gathered more information over the past two weeks.\n\n\"Earlier this week, we inspected the vessel, and observed it undertake several tests while at berth involving systems, processes and equipment. Off the back of these tests we have now lifted the detention notice, but imposed conditions on the operation of the vessel.\"\n\nThis means the Aratere will gradually return to service.\n\n\"Initially, the conditions will allow crew and rail freight only [four return sailings], then trucks and their drivers, followed by a limited passenger service, and then full capacity sailings to be permitted,\" Maritime NZ said in a statement.\n\n\"The full return to service is subject to KiwiRail demonstrating it has implemented its return to service plan, and no further issues have been identified.\"\n\nInterislander executive general manager Duncan Roy said KiwiRail hoped to sail the vessel from Picton to Wellington tomorrow.\n\nNZ First, a coalition Government party, posed an \"extraordinary\" question on X yesterday about what might have caused the grounding.\n\n\"Is it true that the Aratere ran aground when someone put the autopilot on, went for a coffee, and then couldn't turn the autopilot off in time when that someone came back...?\", the party posted.\n\nMaritime NZ said its investigation would take several months and was focused on exploring a broad range of factors.\n\n\"However, while the cause of the grounding is yet to be formally determined, Maritime NZ's preliminary enquiries have found that the incident was not due to a crew member leaving the bridge to make a coffee.\"\n\nKiwiRail has also said the \"regulated number of qualified people\" were on the ship's bridge on the night of the grounding.\n\nMaritime lawyer Troy Stade, engaged by the New Zealand Merchant Service Guild union, told Newstalk ZB Drive host Heather du Plessis-Allan that the post by NZ First and Peters' comments were \"quite frankly unhelpful\".\n\n\"It astounds me that the acting Prime Minister would raise an unsubstantiated rumour and conjecture in the middle of an active investigation.\n\n\"No crew went out. Nescaf\u00e9-gate, if you want to call it, is little more than unsubstantiated rumour.\"\n\nLabour leader Chris Hipkins said NZ First's claim was a \"serious allegation\" and indicated Peters was not holding himself to his own standards.\n\n\"Winston Peters is the first to lambast anyone who makes an allegation that might in any way negatively reflect on him and demand that they front up immediately with the proof,\" Hipkins told the Herald.\n\n\"New Zealand First has made a pretty big allegation here and they should front up with their evidence.\"\n\nPeters has refused to comment to several media organisations, including the Herald, about what evidence his party had to support the allegation and whether it had informed investigators.\n\nPeters, who is currently the acting Prime Minister while Christopher Luxon is in the United States, did appear on The Country radio show earlier today and was asked by host Jamie Mackay where the rumour had started.\n\nPeters said he saw NZ First's social media post, which he said was not his post, and then read KiwiRail's response to it in the Herald's story.\n\n\"I thought crikey, that's not a denial. That's somebody who's talking about an inquiry. Why would you need an inquiry four weeks later into something as simple as that? This is not complicated.\"\n\nPeters said he was going to find out more about it.\n\nMackay suggested to Peters that nothing happened at NZ First without his authority. Peters said the party has a team of people.\n\nMaritime NZ inspectors will now undertake a focused audit of the Interislander fleet in the coming weeks.\n\nThis will look at Interislander's processes, procedures, training, and risk management and how it brings on new equipment and familiarises its personnel.\n\n\"Maritime NZ's inspections and audits are a reflection of a point in time, and the operator, KiwiRail has the primary responsibility for day to day safe operation of the vessel, and its wider fleet,\" Hewlett said.\n\nThe investigation into the cause of the grounding is separate from the detention notice and audit.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZ Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEV_Aratere",

It does not replace the three full investigations (KiwiRail, Maritime NZ and TAIC) into the grounding incident that are underway. The Safety Bulletin states this,\" Roy said.\n\n\"Aratere's autopilot system is not new and has been operating since 2007. It is important that we understand all of the factors involved in the incident, including the underlying causes. A fair and thorough investigation process is crucial for all parties and is being followed.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a New Zealand First post - on social media site X - questioned whether crew negligence had caused the ship to run aground.\n\n\"Is it true that the Aratere ran aground when someone put the autopilot on, went for a coffee, and then couldn't turn the autopilot off in time when that someone came back?\" the post read.\n\n\"If so, why haven't the public been told that?\"\n\nWhen approached by RNZ about the leaked document, the Maritime Union declined to comment on \"second hand reports, tweets etc\".\n\nMerchant Service Guild vice president Ian McLeod said Maritime NZ and the Transport Accident Investigation Commission were interviewing crew members, canvassing the ship's logs and reviewing voice recorder files that ran during the incident.\n\n\"We were very surprised to see Interislander put unconfirmed details out in a bulletin to masters and deck officers while events are still under investigation,\" McLeod said.\n\nMaritime NZ director Kirstie Hewlett said their investigation would cover a much broader scope than the Interislander's safety bulletin.\n\n\"An operator's safety bulletin is not a replacement for a Maritime NZ investigation. Our investigation involves carrying out interviews, examining the vessel, reviewing documents and gathering other information as required,\" Hewlett said.\n\n\"It looks at all the contributing factors that may have caused the incident, including systems, processes, training, equipment and other relevant information. We then assess all the information gathered, then decide what, if any, further action should be taken.\"\n\nIn a separate release, Hewlett confirmed Maritime NZ had lifted the detention notice on the Aratere.\n\n\"Earlier this week, we inspected the vessel, and observed it undertake several tests while at berth involving systems, processes and equipment. Off the back of these tests we have now lifted the detention notice, but imposed conditions on the operation of the vessel,\" Hewlett said.\n\n\"These conditions allow the Aratere to return to service through a graduated and controlled approach that enables further assurance by KiwiRail, any corrective and preventative measures are implemented, and the vessel is operating safely.\n\n\"Initially, the conditions will allow crew and rail freight only (four return sailings), then trucks and their drivers, followed by a limited passenger service, and then full capacity sailings to be permitted.\"\n\nA full return to service would happen if no further issues had been identified and once KiwiRail had \"implemented its return to service plan\".", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz",

Challenged on this, Peters maintained he didn't have enough time to be across all party matters.\n\nLabour leader Chris Hipkins is calling on NZ First and Peters to front up and provide proof. Photo / Mark Mitchell\n\nHipkins accepted party leaders might not know everything their party posted online but he expected Peters would have been aware.\n\n\"Winston Peters is New Zealand First and New Zealand First is Winston Peters.\n\n\"It's a big allegation to make without running it past the leader.\"\n\nHipkins said it was \"extraordinary\" for such a claim to come from a party led by someone acting as the country's Prime Minister.\n\n\"If they've got proof and evidence of it, then they should be sharing that with a degree of urgency.\n\n\"If they haven't, then they shouldn't have made the claim.\"\n\nThe Aratere left Picton at 9.45pm on June 21 before suffering a reported steering failure and running aground shortly after.

But of course, this has happened early and steered it towards the shore.\n\n\"The really interesting thing about this is of course, the crew after that point struggled to return it to manual steering mode, and it took around about a minute before the crew was able to apply reverse thrust and have control of the steering.\n\n\"But by that point, unfortunately, it was too late and the boat - as we all know - went nose-first into Titoki Bay.\"\n\nNalder said it was specifically pointed out as a hazard in the bulletin that a \"single touch\" of this button could cause the ship to change course.\n\n\"The document says that the safety committee will appoint a sub-committee to review vessels control systems - I'm assuming that this means the vessels in the Interislander fleet - and identify buttons that a single activation of could directly control the vessel's movements. You can imagine how this is a pretty significant hazard for these boats.\n\n\"It also recommends that bridge teams on the boats hold refresher training to ensure that functions of the autopilot and steering control systems are fully understood, and also that they're very clear on how to operate their emergency steering and regain control of the ship from autopilot.\n\n\"It also points out some recommendations regarding when autopilot should be used, such as not being an autopilot in any berthing or unberthing situations.\n\n\"But most interestingly enough, it points out the area between the Picton berth and a line that runs from Wedge Point to the Snout - and of course, Titoki Bay is well within that area.\n\n\"So according to the safety report, they would have much preferred that the ferry was not running on autopilot so soon out of the Picton berth.\"\n\nMaritime New Zealand and the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) were running independent probes into the incident, in which no one was injured. The Interislander service is run by state-owned enterprise KiwiRail.\n\n\"KiwiRail say that the bulletin was issued as a part of standard maritime procedure to ensure the crew has awareness of what happened after a serious incident,\" Nadler said.\n\n\"They point out that it doesn't replace the three full investigations that they, Maritime New Zealand and the [TAIC] are conducting into the incident.\n\n\"They also go on to state that the autopilot on Aratere is not new and has been operating since 2007.\"\n\nNew Zealand First has refused to elaborate further on its coffee break allegation. Labour leader Chris Hipkins was unimpressed with the party posting the claim to social media, rather than sharing whatever information it had with investigators.\n\n\"[New Zealand First leader] Winston Peters is the deputy prime minister in the government, I think he should have a slightly higher standard for himself than that.\"\n\nHe said he had seen no evidence of the claim.\n\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon, overseas at a NATO conference, said there would be \"a lot of stories and rumour around what actually did or didn't happen\".\n\nAsked if he was comfortable Peters - the deputy prime minister - had been among those commenting on what might have caused the grounding, Luxon said he had not seen what Peters had said or done, but a process was in place and the government would respond once the reports were completed.\n\n\"We have a TAIC investigation up and running and also a Maritime New Zealand investigation up and running. I'll wait to see those formal reports before I pass any comment.\"\n\nThe Merchant Service Guild's McLeod said considering the circumstances, the Aratere crew \"did exactly the right thing in the very short amount of time available\" to prevent an even worse accident.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interislander", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interislander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Autopilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picton,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Picton, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Picton, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEV_Aratere", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DEV Aratere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ferry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titoki,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titoki, New Zealand"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maritime New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Strait", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cook Strait"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_First", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand First"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugboat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tugboat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Accident_Investigation_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transport Accident Investigation Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiwiRail", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "KiwiRail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautical_mile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nautical mile"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Luxon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Luxon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hipkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hipkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_New_Zealand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Peters", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winston Peters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.rnztools.nz/rnz/image/upload/s--HjiYA7pR--/t_tohu-badge-twitter/v1719124167/4KO4GN8_AAP_9984_JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720564", "eventUri": "eng-9720564", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-21", "textStart": 129, "textEnd": 136}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

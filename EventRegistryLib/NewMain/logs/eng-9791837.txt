The new luxury dog mist has a 24-carat gold-plated paw on the glass bottle and customers are offered an exclusive Dolce & Gabbana dog collar with a tag.\n\nBut whether there is a market for Fef\u00e9 - named after the dog of the brand's co-founder Domenico Dolce - remains to be seen.\n\n\"We're distributing Fef\u00e9 right away throughout Europe, in the US and then, little by little, we'll expand, it's already available online,\" Stefano Gabbana, the brand's other co-founder, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"The market has reacted well, everyone went crazy at the announcement.\"\n\nDog fragrances are hardly new but the foray from a top fashion house is a first. By 2030, the global pet industry - including vet care, pet food and pharmaceuticals among others - is expected to balloon to $500bn from an annual $320bn, according to a 2023 Bloomberg intelligence report.\n\nDiana Rosero-Pena, a Bloomberg analyst and co-author of the report, said: \"We're seeing a profound increase in consumer spending on pets and expect to see this continue through 2030. Consumers are willing to pay more for items for their pets,.\"\n\nIn 2007, Harrods, the luxury London department store, introduced a dog perfume, Sexy Beast. In February 2022, Elizabeth II launched Happy Hounds dog cologne, embellished with the Sandringham royal estate crest. For \u00a320, the British retailer Space NK sells a dog spray with \"crisp top notes\". Kiehl's, owned by L'Or\u00e9al, sells a cuddly coat spritz for \u00a318.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The...\n\nNot content with dressing the top dogs of the music scene, from Beyonc\u00e9 and Usher to Christina Aguilera, Dolce & Gabbana now has its sights on making actual dogs that bit more stylish.\n\nThe Italian fashion label's latest offering is for the dog who truly has it all (or has rolled in it all) -- a designer fragrance, with a price tag to match.\n\nInspiration for the product that the world didn't know it needed came from the \"unconditional love\" that Domenico Dolce -- one half of the famous designer duo -- has for his \"loyal dog Fef\u00e9,\" according to the company's website.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Gabbana had previously adopted the dog but said it was incompatible with his cat.\n\nDolce named the puppy after a pet in an old Italian comedy film. \"It's the diminutive of Raffaele, which means gift from God,\" Dolce told Corriere della Sera, an Italian newspaper. \"And I, as a good Catholic, considered that this dog really was a gift from God.\" He said Fef\u00e9 loved going out for \"a walk\", which involved being carried in a bag.\n\nDolce & Gabbana consulted vets, animal behaviour specialists and dog owners ahead of the product launch. It claimed the scent, which was created by Emilie Bevierre-Coppermann, Dolce & Gabbana's master perfumier, was approved by vets, enjoyed by dogs and safety tested.\n\nHowever one vet has dismissed the new product as a waste of money.\n\nFabian Rivers, a welfare ambassador for the RSPCA, told The Times that most dog toiletries were \"lowbrow products\" that cost less than \u00a315.\n\nMr Rivers said: \"The fact that they're coming into this market at such a high price is an interesting way of having people spend their money on things that have very little merit. But it's your choice on how to spend your money.\"\n\nHe warned that owners might use the spray to mask a pet's unpleasant smell rather than consulting a vet about possible skin infections.\n\nSense of smell not affected\n\nMr Rivers said dogs' sense of smell wouldn't be affected, but claimed they may find the smell \"distracting or unpleasurable\".\n\n\"Clearly, a wealthier demographic are finding new ways to spend their money, which I find frustrating at a time when people are struggling,\" he added.\n\nPet shampoo, balsams, perfumes and deodorants are already on the market, including Aesop's dog shampoo in the US for $43 (\u00a333).\n\nBloomberg estimates the pet economy is worth \u00a3250 billion a year worldwide, with forecasts projecting the market's value could exceed \u00a3390 billion by 2030 as owners buy luxury apparel, carriers and toys.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The...\n\nNot content with dressing the top dogs of the music scene, from Beyonc\u00e9 and Usher to Christina Aguilera, Dolce & Gabbana now has its sights on making actual dogs that bit more stylish.\n\nThe Italian fashion label's latest offering is for the dog who truly has it all (or has rolled in it all) -- a designer fragrance, with a price tag to match.\n\nInspiration for the product that the world didn't know it needed came from the \"unconditional love\" that Domenico Dolce -- one half of the famous designer duo -- has for his \"loyal dog Fef\u00e9,\" according to the company's website.\n\nPeople are also reading...

As classical music plays in the background, a narrator says: \"I am delicate, charismatic, authentic, sensitive, enigmatic, rebel, fresh, irresistible, clean. 'Cause I'm not just a dog. I'm Fef\u00e9.\"\n\nApplying the product looks easy in the commercial as the featured dogs -- aside from the one labeled a rebel -- all sit perfectly still on a high stool for the shoot.\n\nBut for those whose pets are not quite so obliging, the site offers some instructions: \"Spray Fef\u00e9 on your hands or on a brush and proceed by rubbing or brushing your dog's fur from the middle of the body towards the tail to give them a moment of scented pampering.\"\n\nD&G are just the latest brand to try to make the most of the doggy dollar. British designer Anya Hindmarch features a dog poop-bag-holder charm on her website for \u00a3135 ($172). Fashion-conscious pooches could sport a Prada puffer jacket for \u00a3600 ($765) during the day, and snuggle down at night in a large Versace bed for \u00a3915 ($1,170).\n\n___\n\nThese regular pet grooming habits can save you money on vet bills 1.

While some see it as a frivolous indulgence, others question the implications of such a luxury item in the context of animal care and ethics.\n\nAt the heart of D&G's creation, is the designer's love for dogs.\n\nThe advertisement for the fragrance opens with the statement, \"I am delicate, authentic, charismatic,\" showcasing footage of a finely groomed dachshund, chihuahua, and bichon fris\u00e9 perched atop stools. \"Cause I'm not just a dog, I'm Fef\u00e9,\" it said.\n\nPriced at \u20ac99 (Rs. 9,061) for a 100 ml bottle, the alcohol-free mist comes in a sleek green lacquered glass bottle, adorned with a vibrant red metal cap and a precious 24-carat gold-plated paw. As an added luxury, customers are offered an exclusive Dolce & Gabbana dog collar with a tag.\n\nThe \"olfactory masterpiece\" as Dolce claims it is, is developed by Parisian master perfumier Emilie Coppermann and features \"warm notes\" of Ylang, Musk, and Sandalwood.\n\nThe site offers some instructions to apply the product \"Spray Fef\u00e9 on your hands or on a brush and proceed by rubbing or brushing your dog's fur from the middle of the body towards the tail to give them a moment of scented pampering.\" It can also be sprayed directly on their body except for their nose.\n\nBut whether there is a sustained market for Fef\u00e9 remains to be seen.\n\n\"We're distributing Fef\u00e9 right away throughout Europe, in the US and then, little by little, we'll expand; it's already available online,\" Stefano Gabbana, the brand's other co-founder, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"The market has reacted well; everyone went crazy at the announcement.\"\n\nThe doggy dollar\n\nDog fragrances are hardly new but the foray from a top fashion house like D& G is a first and indicates that there is potential for the pet care industry.\n\nAccording to a 2023 Bloomberg intelligence report, by 2030, the global pet industry - including vet care, pet food and pharmaceuticals among others - is expected to balloon to $500 billion from an annual $320 billion.\n\nCapitalising on the lucrative luxury 'doggy dollar', British designer Anya Hindmarch previously introduced a dog poop-bag-holder charm on her website for \u00a3135 (Rs. 14,000). Fashion-savvy pooches can now even strut in a Prada puffer jacket priced at \u00a3600 (Rs. 63,870) during the day and nestle in a large Versace bed for \u00a3915 (Rs. 97,407) at night.\n\nDiana Rosero-Pena, a Bloomberg analyst and co-author of the report was quoted as saying by The Guardian, \"We're seeing a profound increase in consumer spending on pets and expect to see this continue through 2030. Consumers are willing to pay more for items for their pets.\"\n\nHowever, despite its glamorous appeal, the latest D&G creation has not impressed many pet lovers and animal activists.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), the top animal welfare charity in the UK, has warned that the perfume will mess with dogs' sense of smell and can even hamper their ability to connect with their surroundings.\n\n\"Dogs have 300 million smell receptors whereas humans only have six million, so as you can imagine putting scent on a dog really interferes with their sense of smell,\" pet aromatherapy and behaviour expert Katie Gwilt told The Daily Mail.\n\n\"For a working dog carrying a strong unknown smell can really affect their ability to function, and they can get confused as their scent profile has been changed. They may panic thinking that something is wrong, and that they even aren't the same dog, \" added Gwilt.\n\n\"Dogs use scent to perceive the world in the same way that we use our eyes, so we need to consider this when introducing strong smells that they really don't need,\" she further stated.\n\nFabian Rivers, a vet who specialises in small animals and is a welfare ambassador for the RSPCA told The Times that owners may use the spray to mask their pet's unpleasant smell rather than seek veterinary advice about possible skin infections risk causing their dog harm.\n\nHe also noted that most dog toiletries are \"lowbrow\", Fefe on the other hand, \"is an interesting way of having people spend their money on things that have very little merit\".\n\nFabian added that he found it \"frustrating\" that the wealthier demographic buying this type of product is \"finding new ways to spend their money\" while many others are financially struggling.", "source": {"uri":

But it's your choice on how to spend your money.'\n\nFabian added that he found it 'frustrating' that the wealthier demographic buying this type of product are 'finding new ways to spend their money' while many others are financially struggling.\n\nDesigners Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana (pictured at their Fall/Winter 2024 show during Milan Fashion Week in February) are the first major fashion designers to release a dog perfume\n\nThe idea to create the perfume was born some four years ago, after Stefano Gabbana adopted his miniature poodle Fef\u00e9.\n\nHowever, the puppy did not get along with his cat, so Stefano gave Fef\u00e9 to his business partner Domenico Dolce.\n\nIn an interview published by Italian newspaper the Corriere della Sera on Sunday, Domenico said he and his partner Guilherme Siqueira experienced love at first sight when they took in the dog, adding that they were 'immediately bewitched' by him.\n\nThe dog's name is a diminutive of Raffaele, which Domenico said 'means gift from God...And I, as a good Catholic, considered that this dog really was a gift from God'.\n\nFef\u00e9 (the scent) should be applied to people's hands or a brush, before being applied to their dog's fur, according to the brand, which added that it can be also be directly applied to dogs, but the nose area should be avoided.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

'Cause I'm not just a dog. I'm Fef\u00e9.\"\n\nThe perfume has been developed by master perfumer Emilie Coppermann, who has spent over 20 years creating fragrances for some of the biggest designer houses like Givenchy, Chopard, and Karl Lagerfeld.\n\nAccording to the label's website, Fef\u00e9 is alcohol-free, has been tested, and was approved by vets.\n\nFef\u00e9 was originally adopted by Stefano Gabbana, who discovered that the miniature poodle puppy did not get along with his male cat. Gabbana gave him to Dolce, who instantly fell in love.\n\n\"It's the diminutive of Raffaele, which means gift from God,\" Dolce told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"And I, as a good Catholic, considered that this dog really was a gift from God.\"\n\nDolce added that he named Fef\u00e9 after a pet from an old Italian comedy film starring actress Franca Valeri.\n\nThe market for pet products is growing quickly. Bloomberg has reported that the pet economy is worth an annual $320bn worldwide and is likely to reach $500bn by 2030.\n\nWhile Dolce and Gabbana may be the first luxury brand to launch a fragrance for pets, several other labels have already made their foray into designer items for pets. Labels like Miu Miu, Burberry, Moncler, and Christian Louboutin all sell distinctive harnesses, leash and collar sets, and Louis Vuitton has a dog carrier with its iconic monogram canvas.\n\n\"We're distributing Fef\u00e9 right away throughout Europe, in the US and then, little by little, we'll expand;

According to Dolce & Gabbana, the fragrance is an \"olfactory masterpiece\". But, it also comes with a hefty price tag.\n\nThe Italian luxury house Dolce & Gabbana has discovered a new market segment: the business of dog fragrances.\n\nThe fragrance, called \"Fef\u00e9\", is hitting the market these days. The 100 ml bottle is priced at a hefty 99 euros. With each purchase, an exclusive dog collar featuring a Dolce & Gabbana plaque is included, which can be customized according to the company.\n\n(Image: Dolce & Gabanna)\n\nDeveloped by a Master Perfumer\n\nFef\u00e9 is described as an \"olfactory masterpiece\", characterized by its delicate and subtle aromas. The exquisite fragrance was developed by a Parisian master perfumer, who has created scents for Balmain and Paco Rabanne, according to the luxury label.\n\nVeterinarians are not as enthusiastic about Fef\u00e9. Fabian Rivers, a veterinarian specializing in small animals, told \"The Times\" that the product is a money-making scheme. Most pet grooming products cost less than 15 euros. \"It's an interesting way of having people spend their money on things that have very little merit.

The fragrance is named after cofounder Domenico Dolce's famous companion dog. The alcohol-free scented mist for dogs is described as \"delicate, authentic, charismatic\" in an advertising campaign.\n\nBut PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk, who is the author of book Let's Have a Dog Party, told Plant Based News that perfumes can be hugely distressing for dogs due to their reliance on their sense of smell. \"Dogs have an extraordinarily sensitive sense of smell - they have hundreds of millions more receptors in their nostrils and can smell 10,000 to 100,000 times better than humans - and can pick up scents a mile away, so squirting them with a fragrance designed to please humans, as this is, can upset them greatly,\" she said.\n\nRead more: Hot Weather Poses 'Huge Threat' To Flat Faced Dogs, Charity Warns\n\nNewkirk added that, due to the fact dogs are unable to shake it off, the perfume scent can \"cause them irritation and distress and interfere with their ability to detect other smells in their environment and communicate with other animals they encounter.\"\n\n\"PETA advises dog guardians never to apply any scented sprays to their animal companions and reminds people to consider that our dogs love us just as we are - and we should extend the same courtesy to them,\" she added.\n\nDemand for dog perfume\n\nThere are a number of dog perfumes already on the market. They can be found around the world in \"pet\" stores, groomers, and even the British Royal Estate of Sandringham's online store.\n\nAccording to Dolce & Gabbana, the market has \"reacted well\" to the latest launch. \"Everyone went crazy at the announcement,\" Stefano Gabbana, the company's other cofounder, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.

Therefore we advise that strong-scented products such as perfumes or sprays are avoided, especially as some smells can be really unpleasant for dogs.\"\n\nStefano Gabbana, Dolce & Gabbana's other co-founder, remains optimistic about the product's market potential.\n\n\"We're distributing Fef\u00e9 right away throughout Europe, in the US and then, little by little, we'll expand; it's already available online,\"\n\nGabbana told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. \"The market has reacted well; everyone went crazy at the announcement.\"\n\nWhile dog fragrances are not new, Dolce & Gabbana's entry into this niche market is a first for a high-fashion brand.\n\nThe global pet industry -- including vet care, pet food, and pharmaceuticals -- is expected to grow from US$320 billion (RM1.43 trillion) annually to US$500 billion (RM2.23 trillion by 2030, according to a 2023 Bloomberg Intelligence report.\n\nDiana Rosero-Pena, a Bloomberg analyst and co-author of the report, stated, \"We're seeing a profound increase in consumer spending on pets and expect to see this continue through 2030. Consumers are willing to pay more for items for their pets.\"\n\nPast luxury pet fragrances include Harrods' 2007 \"Sexy Beast\" and Elizabeth II's \"Happy Hounds\" cologne, launched in February 2022. British retailer Space NK offers a \u00a320 (RM114) dog spray with \"crisp top notes,\" while Kiehl's, owned by L'Or\u00e9al, sells a \u00a318 (RM103) cuddle coat spritz.", "source": {"uri":

During an appearance on The Howard Stern Show, the 44-year-old actress and comedian spoke about her dating life and what type of man she\u2019s into. \u201cI want him to be handsome to me,\u201d said Haddish when Stern asked what she\u2019s looking for. \u201cSomething like a Michael B. [Jordan] or Usher is handsome and Henry Cavill is handsome. Brad Pitt is handsome. I think you\u2019re handsome.\u201d The Girls Trip actress continued, \u201cAlso, like are they taking care of themselves? Health wise? Do they like to have adventure? I love adventure. Like, let\u2019s go on some kind of journey. Let\u2019s go on a hike or let\u2019s take a trip somewhere, let\u2019s go to an island or something like that. Yeah, I love a good trip.\u201d Stern apparently knew that Haddish was trying to bed DiCaprio and asked her how that was going next. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m still working on that. I think I might be too old,\u201d answered Haddish, before conceding that she might not be his type. DiCaprio, 49, is currently dating 26-year-old Italian supermodel Vittoria Ceretti. \u201cWhen I first met him I told him, \u2018I want to fuck, but only if you are your character out of What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape?,\u2019\u201d added Haddish. In the 1993 film, DiCaprio starred opposite Johnny Depp and played the role of Arnie, a teenager with an intellectual disability. The role secured him his first-ever Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. \u201cI liked him as Arnie, I like my man with a little bit of a disability,\u201d Haddish concluded. You can watch the clip above. Haddish told a similar story in 2018 during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live. \u201cI was like \u2018I wanna hit,\u2019\u201d she recalled telling DiCaprio. \u201cHe\u2019s like \u2018What?\u2019 I said, \u2018I wanna hit that, I ain\u2019t talking about drugs.\u2019\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know if he thought I was playing but I was dead serious,\u201d she told Kimmel. \u201cCall me.\u201d Haddish had a recent DUI arrest and was accused of child sex abuse in 2022 in connection with a 2013 Funny or Die sketch she did with Aries Spears. The lawsuit was eventually dropped, however.", "summary": "She didn't mince words when she met the actor.", "url": "https://decider.com/2024/06/09/tiffany-haddish-says-she-told-leonardo-dicaprio-i-want-to-fk-under-one-condition/", "image": "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155562627.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1156", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:28:35", "author": "Michael Haskoor,mliss1578", "authors": ["Michael Haskoor", "mliss1578"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.2}

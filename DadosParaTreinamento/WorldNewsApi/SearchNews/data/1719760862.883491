{"id": 225032522, "title": "&#039;We are going to die&#039;: Court told man threatened woman, baby and two bus loads of children", "text": "He was charged with four offences, including two counts under weapons legislation for the production of a knife at Gardiner Street and Parnell Square in the north inner city. The other two charges are under the Public Order Act for threatening, abusive, or insulting words and behaviour at the two locations. He was brought to Mountjoy Garda station, where he declined the offer of legal representation. Mr Peavoy was charged and held pending his appearance before Judge Gerard Jones at Dublin District Court on Wednesday. Solicitor Tracy Horan told Judge Jones the man's family had approached her for assistance, and it had been suggested he would be remanded in custody for a psychiatric assessment. Detective Garda Paul Griffin told the court he intended to object to bail, and Mr Peavoy insisted he would represent himself. The court heard that Mr Peavoy's replies to two charges were: \"I object, I have evidence that this is not true.\" He also answered, \"I object\" and \"This is the only one that is somewhat lawful\". Outlining the evidence, Detective Garda Griffin said that it was alleged the accused was armed with a knife. The weapon was handed into court, in a protective casing, for the judge to inspect. 'Public danger' When the judge asked if there had been \"any public danger,\" the detective replied, \"Yes.\" He said at 8.42am, the accused brandished a knife at Parnell Square and then, while acting erratically and aggressively, threatened a woman with her baby telling her to \"fuck off\". \"This was totally unprovoked,\" he said, adding that there was a coach full of cr\u00e8che children, which the accused blocked with his hands outstretched. The court heard the children saw him and became \"hysterical\", and two of them were allegedly overheard saying: \"We're going to die\". The second incident was 35 minutes later, when the accused allegedly brandished the knife at Gardiner Street. It was claimed he went up to a bus carrying school children, but the driver closed the doors. It was alleged the accused \"stared at the driver and pointed at the knife in a sheath in his belt in a clear attempt to intimidate the driver\". The court heard the children were aged six to 12 years. In court, Mr Peavoy initially denied his name, made reference to a \"king's army\", recognising the court, wanting \"the Hague here\" and he cited the legal authority of EU. Judge Jones said he could not force the accused to have a solicitor to act on his behalf. Remanding him in custody, he added: \"This man is a danger to himself and to the public in his present state, the children involved.\". He praised the garda\u00ed and actions of the bus drivers who protected the children. Mr Peavoy will appear again at Cloverhill District Court on June 5 via video link. The judge directed medical attention in custody.", "summary": "The court heard that it was alleged the accused was armed with a knife at Gardiner Street and Parnell Square in Dublin", "url": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/courtandcrime/arid-41405366.html", "image": "https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/8274/4137269_6_seoimage1x1_Oisin_20Peavoy.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:17:00", "author": "Irishexaminer.com,Tom Tuite", "authors": ["Irishexaminer.com", "Tom Tuite"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.521}

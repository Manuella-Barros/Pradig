The ruling overturned a Colorado court decision to kick Trump off the ballot there and will keep Trump on the ballot in Illinois as well, where a Cook County judge had ruled in favor of voters who filed a lawsuit to disqualify Trump on similar 14th Amendment grounds.\n\nIt's up to Congress to enforce the 14th Amendment for candidates for federal office, the Supreme Court said. It's hard to argue much with a unanimous ruling, especially when the alternative might have been a patchwork of different presidential ballots across the country.\n\nThe Supreme Court acted a little over two months after the Dec. 19, 2023 Colorado decision.\n\nWe wish the court had decided to act more quickly too, on another crucial question involving Trump and the upcoming election: Trump's claim of presidential immunity from criminal prosecution. Trump's lawyers are making the claim in Special Counsel Jack Smith's case against the former president for allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nTrump, in essence, believes a president is above the law.\n\nA Washington, D.C. appeals court recently rejected that notion, keeping the election interference case moving toward a trial that was supposed to begin this month. Then Trump appealed, and the Supreme Court agreed to take the case, setting oral arguments for April 25.\n\nWe're glad the court will settle the matter once and for all, though sooner would be far preferable than later. Now a trial could take place during the height of the campaign season, allowing Trump to portray himself as a political martyr rather than a defendant in four separate cases.\n\nSmith had asked the Supreme Court not to put Trump's D.C. case on hold while Trump pursues his appeals.\n\n\"Delay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict -- a compelling interest in every criminal case and one that has unique national importance here,\" Smith wrote in his brief to the court.\n\nWe agree. The public surely has a compelling interest the outcome of this case. Two-thirds of voters don't believe Trump should be immune from criminal prosecution, according to a recent PBS/NPR/Marist poll.\n\nAll the more reason the public deserves to know, well ahead of the election, whether one candidate is, in the eyes of a jury, a criminal who thinks he's above the law.", "source": {"uri": "chicago.suntimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Sun-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Tuesday", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Tuesday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballot_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballot access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_County,_Illinois", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cook County, Illinois"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/e1e3b36/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5392x3078+0+257/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24549835%2F1476375309.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9365807", "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 447472119, "relevance": 1}

But States have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency.\"\n\nThe nine-judge court said that responsibility for enforcing Section 3 against federal officeholders and candidates \"rests with Congress and not the States\".\n\nTrump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection but was acquitted thanks to Republican support in the Senate.\n\nHe is scheduled to go on trial in New York on 25 March on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nAmong other cases, Trump also faces federal charges in Florida of refusing to give up top secret documents after leaving the White House.\n\nWith reporting from \u00a9 AFP 2024\n\nMaking a difference A mix of advertising and supporting contributions helps keep paywalls away from valuable information like this article.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) filed a complaint with the Department of Justice Inspector General on Wednesday, accusing special counsel Jack Smith of election interference by resisting attempts to delay his criminal prosecution of former President Trump.\n\nSmith has pushed federal judges not to delay his case against Trump, which alleges that the former president attempted to overturn the 2020 election. Trump's attorneys have invoked the Supreme Court over whether Trump can be prosecuted at all, possibly pushing back trial past the 2024 general election.\n\nGaetz claims that Smith's work is intended to influence the 2024 election, violating DOJ policy.\n\n\"The witch hunt against President Trump by Attorney General Garland and Special Counsel Smith is a partisan exercise, and the American people know it,\" Gaetz said in a statement. \"The actions of the Special Counsel Smith to speed up the trial against President Trump violate the DOJ's rules and the law.\"\n\n\"His public comments and his office's briefs before the Supreme Court demonstrate that he has no reason for his actions other than to unlawfully interfere in the 2024 presidential election,\" he continued.\n\nUnwritten DOJ policy generally forbids prosecutors from actions that could be seen as influencing an election within 60 days of Election Day. Gaetz argued in the letter that the logic of the rule should be extended to now because \"it is indisputable that we are already in an election season.\"\n\nGaetz's letter to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz specifically claims that Smith's attempts to speed the case through courts is a \"violation of law.\"\n\n\"It is the core of prohibited conduct that a purpose (not the purpose) of any official action of a prosecutor be to affect any election,\" Gaetz writes. \"It may be morally correct that the American people should see swift resolution of this case, perhaps with dropped charges or a Trump acquittal before the November 2024 Presidential election, but wielding Executive Branch authority in the service of this is a violation of law. Prosecutors must be held to a higher standard.\"\n\nThe congressman requests Horowitz interview Smith on the rationale behind requesting a speedy trial, in an attempt to clarify his motive and ensure that it is not to impact the general election.\n\nLast month, Trump's attorneys said Smith was twisting \"into logical knots\" in arguing against delaying the trial, making a similar case to Gaetz' letter.\n\n\"The Special Counsel's latest filing raises a compelling inference of a political motive -- the motivation to influence the 2024 Presidential election by bringing the leading Republican candidate to trial before November 5, 2024,\" Trump's lawyers wrote.\n\nThe letter adds to conservative criticism of Smith's case, which Trump and his allies have labeled a political prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments on whether Trump is immune from prosecution due to his work as the president in late April.

Now, jury selection is set to begin in late March.\n\nThe charges stem from an investigation by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg that alleges Mr Trump tried to cover up hush money payments that he made to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in 2016 to silence her claims of an extramarital affair.\n\n25 April 2024 - Supreme Court hears oral arguments for Trump's presidential immunity defence\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed in February to hear the case from Mr Trump after lower courts rejected his presidential immunity defence from criminal charges related to his alleged attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe arguments will take place on the last day of the court's calendar. The court's ruling is highly anticipated after the election conspiracy case, prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, DC, essentially came to a halt when Mr Trump came forward with his defence.\n\nSo far, Mr Trump's defence has been shot down at both the appeals court and by the federal judge overseeing the case. Last month, appeals court judges wrote that \"citizen Trump\" is not shielded by executive immunity, and that his \"alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were, if proven, an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government.\"\n\nJuly 2024 - federal classified documents trial could begin\n\nMr Trump is expected back in federal court this summer, this time in Florida, to face 40 charges pertaining to his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.\n\nOfficials have yet to announce an exact date, but prosecutors have proposed 8 July as an option. The trial was initially supposed to begin 20 May.\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted Mr Trump last June for allegedly unlawfully retaining top-secret documents that contained national security information at his Mar-a-Lago home after he left office. The charges include violating a section of the Espionage Act for allegedly unlawfully retaining top-secret documents that contained national security information.\n\n15-18 July 2024 - GOP convention\n\nAfter the remaining states conduct their primaries, the Republican Party will host its convention where it will announce an official nominee.\n\nAt the moment, Mr Trump is the unofficial presumptive Republican nominee after his final GOP opponent, Nikki Haley, dropped out of the race. Her concession came after losing fourteen state primaries to the former president on Super Tuesday.\n\n5 August 2024 - Georgia election interference trial\n\nThree months before election day, Mr Trump is expected to head to trial in Georgia for his alleged involvement in trying to overturn the state's 2020 election results in his favour.\n\nThe former president was charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute along with 18 other co-defendants.\n\nMr Trump faces 12 additional charges including solicitation of a public officer, conspiracy to make false statements under oath and more.\n\nHowever, the trial could be delayed as District Attorney Fani Willis faces allegations from Mr Trump's legal team that a previous romantic relationship with a proseuctor she hired for the case presents a conflict of interest.\n\n5 November 2024 - Election Day\n\nOn Tuesday, 5 November, US voters will head to the polls to cast their vote for president.\n\nGlancing over Mr Trump's calendar, it may seem like his ability to successfully campaign is virtually impossible. But the ex-president has positioned himself to benefit from his trials.\n\n\"In a weird way, none of this really bothers him. In fact, it's a great asset for him politically,\" Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy LLP and former assistant US attorney, told The Independent.\n\nMr Trump has capitalised on his trials by painting himself as a victim - or martyr as Mr O'Brien points out - to appeal to his supporters.\n\nAfter each indictment, the ex-president's campaign has called on supporters to express their outrage through their wallets. Splashed across his website, Truth Social posts and emails is Mr Trump's new slogan: \"They're not after me, they're after you... I'm just standing in the way.\"\n\nEven though some of the trials raise questions about Mr Trump's ability to lead the country successfully - like his classified documents case and the federal election interference case - his former job and loyal fanbase reinforce his ability to be president.\n\n\"He can always argue, and he will argue up until the day of the election, this is all unfair and he wasn't able to campaign effectively because of all these persecutions from Garland and Biden,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\nBut the likelihood that Mr Trump will actually have to juggle three criminal trials and a campaign at the same time is still unclear. Though the judges in each case have set start dates, they can be changed - and according to Mr O'Brien, it is likely that they will be.\n\nMr O'Brien said the three trials are \"not feasible\" because they require massive time and resources from both the prosecutors and Mr Trump's legal team.\n\n\"It's terribly unfair to the defence,\" Mr O'Brien said. \"It takes months and months to prepare for one of these large white-collar cases - he only has so much manpower at his disposal.\"\n\nAlready, Mr Trump's legal team has sought to delay the trials by using every legal motion possible.\n\nMost likely is that two of the trials against Mr Trump will need to be delayed until after the election. Prosecutors may choose to go forward with the strongest case against the ex-president which appears to be the federal election interference case.\n\n\"Those issues are important for voters, it's important to know how he intends to defend himself against what appears to be a pretty serious constitutional and criminal offence,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\nMr O'Brien suggested the case could take two to three months to be completed which would mean the trial could conclude shortly before the GOP convention.\n\nEven if it's the only case Mr Trump is trailed in before the election, there's no telling how the outcome will change voters', and the Republican Party's, perception of the former president.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

president had never been charged with a crime.\n\nThe Supreme Court has historically been loath to get involved in political questions, but it is taking center stage in this year's White House race.\n\nOn Monday, the court removed a potential hurdle to Trump's bid to recapture the White House, unanimously dismissing a state court ruling that could have barred him from the ballot.\n\nThe question before the nine justices was whether Trump was ineligible to appear on the Republican presidential primary ballot in Colorado because he engaged in an insurrection -- the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.\n\nTrump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection but was acquitted thanks to Republican support in the Senate.\n\nHe is scheduled to go on trial in New York on March 25 on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nAmong other cases, Trump also faces federal charges in Florida of refusing to give up top secret documents after leaving the White House.\n\ncl/nro", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro

The court's ruling is highly anticipated after the election conspiracy case, prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, DC, essentially came to a halt when Mr Trump came forward with his defence.\n\nSo far, Mr Trump's defence has been shot down at both the appeals court and by the federal judge overseeing the case. Last month, appeals court judges wrote that \"citizen Trump\" is not shielded by executive immunity, and that his \"alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were, if proven, an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government.\"\n\n20 May 2024 - federal classified documents trial begins\n\nTen other states will have conducted their primaries by the time Mr Trump is expected back in federal court, this time in Florida, to face 40 charges pertaining to his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents.\n\nFederal prosecutors indicted Mr Trump in June for allegedly unlawfully retaining top-secret documents that contained national security information at his Mar-a-Lago home after he left office.\n\nThe charges include violating a section of the Espionage Act for allegedly unlawfully retaining top-secret documents that contained national security information.\n\nThe trial is set to begin less than two months before the GOP convention in July.\n\n15-18 July 2024 - GOP convention\n\nAfter the remaining states conduct their primaries, the Republican Party will host its convention where it will announce an official nominee.\n\nAt the moment, Mr Trump is leading the polls but depending on how the year plays out, he may not become the party's nominee.\n\n5 August 2024 - Georgia election interference trial\n\nThree months before election day, Mr Trump is expected to head to trial in Georgia for his alleged involvement in trying to overturn the state's 2020 election results in his favour.\n\nThe former president was charged with violating Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute along with 18 other co-defendants.\n\nMr Trump faces 12 additional charges including solicitation of a public officer, conspiracy to make false statements under oath and more.\n\n5 November 2024 - Election Day\n\nOn Tuesday, 5 November, US voters will head to the polls to cast their vote for president.\n\nGlancing over Mr Trump's calendar, it may seem like his ability to successfully campaign is virtually impossible. But the ex-president has positioned himself to benefit from his trials.\n\n\"In a weird way, none of this really bothers him. In fact, it's a great asset for him politically,\" Kevin O'Brien, a partner at Ford O'Brien Landy LLP and former assistant US attorney, told The Independent.\n\nMr Trump has capitalised on his trials by painting himself as a victim - or martyr as Mr O'Brien points out - to appeal to his supporters.\n\nAfter each indictment, the ex-president's campaign has called on supporters to express their outrage through their wallets. Splashed across his website, Truth Social posts and emails is Mr Trump's new slogan: \"They're not after me, they're after you... I'm just standing in the way.\"\n\nEven though some of the trials raise questions about Mr Trump's ability to lead the country successfully - like his classified documents case and the federal election interference case - his former job and loyal fanbase reinforce his ability to be president.\n\n\"He can always argue, and he will argue up until the day of the election, this is all unfair and he wasn't able to campaign effectively because of all these persecutions from Garland and Biden,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\nBut the likelihood that Mr Trump will actually have to juggle three criminal trials and a campaign at the same time is still unclear. Though the judges in each case have set start dates, they can be changed - and according to Mr O'Brien, it is likely that they will be.\n\nMr O'Brien said the three trials are \"not feasible\" because they require massive time and resources from both the prosecutors and Mr Trump's legal team.\n\n\"It's terribly unfair to the defence,\" Mr O'Brien said. \"It takes months and months to prepare for one of these large white-collar cases - he only has so much manpower at his disposal.\"\n\nAlready, Mr Trump's legal team has sought to delay the trials by using every legal motion possible.\n\nMost likely is that two of the trials against Mr Trump will need to be delayed until after the election. Prosecutors may choose to go forward with the strongest case against the ex-president which appears to be the federal election interference case.\n\n\"Those issues are important for voters, it's important to know how he intends to defend himself against what appears to be a pretty serious constitutional and criminal offence,\" Mr O'Brien said.\n\nMr O'Brien suggested the case could take two to three months to be completed which would mean the trial could conclude shortly before the GOP convention.\n\nEven if it's the only case Mr Trump is trailed in before the election, there's no telling how the outcome will change voters', and the Republican Party's, perception of the former president.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors":

It previously had disclosed which week it would hear the matter but had not given the precise date.\n\nThe justices will review a lower court's rejection of Trump's claim of immunity from prosecution because he was president when he took actions aimed at reversing US president Joe Biden's election victory over him.\n\nTrump, the first former US president to face criminal charges, is poised to become the Republican nominee to challenge the Democratic president in the November 5th US election. His last rival for the nomination, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, pulled out of the race on Wednesday.\n\nThe immunity case again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday handed Trump a major victory by ensuring he will remain on the presidential ballot. The justices barred states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection, reversing a judicial decision to exclude him from Colorado's ballot for his conduct related to the January 6th, 2021, attack on the US Capitol by his supporters.\n\nLast month, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \"unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralise the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case. A March 4th trial date was postponed as Trump pressed his immunity claim, with no new date yet set.\n\nTrump has three other pending criminal cases, with a trial in New York state court concerning hush money paid to a porn star set to begin on March 25th. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of them, seeking to portray them as politically motivated.\n\nSmith's charges accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against the right of Americans to vote.\n\nTrump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.\n\nIn a separate case to be argued on April 16th, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a man involved in the Capitol attack can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding - the congressional certification of the 2020 election results.\n\nThat case has potential implications for Trump because Smith brought two obstruction-related charges.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki",

Court on Wednesday set April 25 as the date to hear Donald Trump's claim that as a former president he is immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nTrump, 77, the all-but-certain 2024 Republican presidential nominee, had been scheduled to go on trial in Washington this week for conspiring to subvert the results of the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nBut the proceedings have been frozen as his presidential immunity claim wound its way through the courts.\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith filed the election conspiracy case against Trump in August and had been pushing hard for the March start date for his trial.\n\nBut lawyers for the former president have sought repeatedly to delay the trial until after the November presidential election, when Trump could potentially have all of the federal cases against him dropped if he wins.\n\nThe nation's highest court accepted the high-stakes case at the end of February and had said at the time it would schedule oral arguments for the week of April 22.\n\nIn agreeing to hear the immunity case, the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, which includes three justices nominated by Trump himself, said it was not \"expressing a view on the merits\" of a lower court's ruling that rejected his immunity claim.\n\nIt said it would address the question of whether a former president has \"immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\"\n\nA ruling is expected by the end of the court's current term in June or early July.\n\nThe question of whether an ex-president is immune from prosecution is an untested one in American jurisprudence because until Trump, a former president had never been charged with a crime.\n\nThe Supreme Court has historically been loath to get involved in political questions, but it is taking center stage in this year's White House race.\n\nOn Monday, the court removed a potential hurdle to Trump's bid to recapture the White House, unanimously dismissing a state court ruling that could have barred him from the ballot.\n\nThe question before the nine justices was whether Trump was ineligible to appear on the Republican presidential primary ballot in Colorado because he engaged in an insurrection -- the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by his supporters.\n\nTrump was impeached by the Democratic-majority House of Representatives for inciting an insurrection but was acquitted thanks to Republican support in the Senate.\n\nHe is scheduled to go on trial in New York on March 25 on charges of covering up hush money payments to a porn star ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nAmong other cases, Trump also faces federal charges in Florida of refusing to give up top secret documents after leaving the White House.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label":

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) is asking the independent watchdog of the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate special counsel Jack Smith over whether the prosecutor is allowing the 2024 election to impact the timeline of his case against former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn a Wednesday letter obtained exclusively by The Daily Wire, Gaetz raises concerns to DOJ Inspector General Michael Horowitz that Smith is pressing the Supreme Court to fast-track consideration of Trump's presidential immunity claim to clear the way for a trial. The congressman draws attention to a section of the Justice Manual that says federal prosecutors \"may never select the timing of any action, including investigative steps, criminal charges, or statements, for the purpose of affecting any election, or for the purpose of giving an advantage or disadvantage to any candidate or political party.\"\n\nThe congressman says the memo is \"quite clear\" and opined that Smith's filing to the Supreme Court in December \"tacitly concedes\" a violation of DOJ rules, as Trump is running another campaign for the White House in this year's election. \"Specifically, that reply brief repeatedly urges 'rapid' review of the federal prosecution of Presidential Candidate Donald J. Trump, and the incredible 'public importance' of the case, without once explicitly stating why the rapidity is warranted, or what the public importance is,\" Gaetz says.\n\n\"Were there a legitimate, non-election related purpose for this request, these attorneys, who have filed in appeals courts many times, would have listed such. Since charges have been filed and the defendant himself is taking a legal position on timing and lodging various appeals, that justification cannot, for example, be the rights of the defendant under the Constitution or Speedy Trial Act,\" Gaetz continues. \"So, there can be only one conclusion: Special Counsel Jack Smith sees it as of paramount importance to hold a trial before the November 2024 election, but he is unable to explicitly say so, as such a justification is in violation of Departmental policy and law.\"\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty in the federal case in which he is accused of unlawfully plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. His lawyers filed to dismiss the case in October by arguing that Trump's actions were \"within the heartland\" of his \"official duties.\" The ensuing battle over the immunity claim led to the presiding judge's plan for a March 4 trial start date to fall by the wayside.\n\nThe Supreme Court rejected Smith's request to quickly take up the immunity question in December, leaving the issue to first be considered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. After a panel of the appeals court ruled against the immunity claim, the Supreme Court agreed to take up the issue last month and has scheduled an oral argument date for April 25.\n\nGaetz told The Daily Wire that Smith's investigation is clearly a \"partisan exercise.\"\n\n\"The witch hunt against President Trump by Attorney General Garland and Special Counsel Smith is a partisan exercise, and the American people know it,\" Gaetz said on Wednesday. \"The actions of the Special Counsel Smith to speed up the trial against President Trump violate the DOJ's rules and the law. His public comments and his office's briefs before the Supreme Court demonstrate that he has no reason for his actions other than to unlawfully interfere in the 2024 presidential election.\"\n\nTrump is facing three other criminal cases, including another one led by Smith over the former president's handling of classified documents, as well as civil litigation. Trump has broadly denied any wrongdoing and has argued that politically motivated prosecutors are conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him. Trump recently cited presidential immunity in a request to get the documents case dismissed.\n\nGaetz, a lawyer, lays out his argument in the letter for why it's legally improper to carry out the case during \"election season.\"\n\n\"It is indisputable that we are already in an election season. However, the Justice Manual does not set hard dates,\" Gaetz says in his letter. \"It is the core of prohibited conduct that a purpose (not the purpose) of any official action of a prosecutor be to affect any election: it may be morally correct that the American people should see swift resolution of this case, perhaps with dropped charges or a Trump acquittal before the November 2024 Presidential election, but wielding Executive Branch authority in the service of this is a violation of law. Prosecutors must be held to a higher standard.\"\n\nAfter accusing the DOJ of failing to comply with oversight requests from Congress, Gaetz goes on to implore Horowitz to give his \"immediate attention into compliance of the Office of Special Counsel Jack Smith with Departmental regulations, particularly related to investigatory and prosecutorial actions during an election season.\"\n\n\"The precise scope of an investigation may be as narrow as interviewing the Special Counsel, and determining that he has a lawful purpose in seeking the expediting of his case against Donald Trump, and determining that he did not have the purpose of keying a trial date to the election calendar. Or it may be wider,\" the letter concludes. \"Please alert my office of any developments in this matter.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Manual", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justice Manual"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_E._Horowitz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael E.

The court will now hear arguments on whether Trump is immune from prosecution in Special Counsel Jack Smith's election interference case on April 25. This comes after the Supreme Court agreed to review whether Trump has immunity from prosecution in Smith's case and fast-tracked the appeal. A ruling from the high court is expected by late June, putting Trump's criminal trial on hold pending resolution on the matter.\n\nTrump and his legal team argued that if the prosecution of a President is upheld, such prosecutions will become increasingly common, leading to destructive cycles of recrimination. They believe that criminal prosecution imposes a greater personal vulnerability on the President than civil penalties and that the threat of future criminal prosecution by a politically opposed administration would overshadow every future President's official acts. Trump's request expresses concern that political opponents could use the threat of indictment as a means of influencing and controlling the President's decisions.\n\nSmith has charged the former president with conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights. These charges stem from Smith's investigation into Trump's alleged involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot and any interference in the 2020 election result. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August.\n\nThis is the second time this term that the Supreme Court will hear a case involving Trump. Just recently, the court unanimously sided with Trump in his challenge to Colorado's attempt to remove him from the 2024 primary ballot. The court ruled in favor of Trump's arguments, which will have implications for similar efforts in other states to remove him from their respective ballots. Challenges to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot have been filed in over 30 states.\n\nIn response to the recent ruling, Trump has shifted his focus to the issue of presidential immunity. He believes that immunity is crucial for the presidency to function properly and effectively, stating that without it, the presidency would be reduced to a ceremonial position. Trump argues that no president would be able to carry out their duties without complete and total immunity, and that the country would be put at great risk without it.\n\nThe Supreme Court's decision on whether Trump is immune from prosecution in Smith's case will have significant implications for the future of presidential immunity. Trump's supporters view this as a critical decision that will determine the extent of a president's protections from prosecution. The outcome of this case is eagerly awaited by both sides, with a ruling expected by late June.", "source": {"uri": "dcweekly.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "DC Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_conspiracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal conspiracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_against_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy against the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://dcweekly.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Supreme_Court_to_hear_arguments_in_Trump_presidential_immunity_case_on_April_25-1024x576.webp", "eventUri": "eng-9365807", "sentiment": -0.4745098039215686, "wgt": 447454930, "relevance": 1}

United States, dealing with the scope of an obstruction statute used to charge hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, which could also have a major impact on Trump's case, as the statute is connected to two of the charges in his indictment.\n\nThe Supreme Court also ruled Monday that Trump could not be disqualified from Colorado's ballot. It held that Congress, not states, is responsible for enforcing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which restricts individuals who took an oath to the Constitution and then \"engaged in insurrection\" from holding office.\n\n\"In light of the Supreme Court taking up the presidential immunity case, I seriously doubt the D.C. federal trial will take place before the election,\" John Malcolm, vice president for the Heritage Foundation's Institute for Constitutional Government and former deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ's Criminal Division, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \"In addition to the fact that the Supreme Court will have to issue its decision in that case and the Fischer case - both of which will likely occur in late June - and assuming that the Supreme Court rules against former President Trump, there are still several pretrial matters pending before Judge Chutkan that would have to be resolved before a trial could begin.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan initially rejected Trump's bid to dismiss his case based on presidential immunity in December.

Circuit rejected his call for an immunity ruling, The Washington Post reported.\n\nTrump, now the presumptive GOP nominee, has been trying to push back his trial in D.C., on charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith, and other criminal trials until after the general election.\n\nTrump's pretrial won't start in Washington, D.C., until after the Supreme Court issues its ruling. That could come any time after the oral arguments are held, with the court expected to announce its decision before its term wraps up in early July or late June. If the ruling comes that late, it would likely push the trial into late summer or into the fall.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled quickly on issuing a decision against the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling keeping Trump off that state's ballots, based on a clause in the 14th Amendment against allowing insurrectionists to hold office.\n\nThe court's ruling in the D.C. immunity case could also affect Trump's other legal proceedings. He has pleaded not guilty in all four criminal cases. He has also raised immunity questions in federal charges in Florida, where he is accused of illegally keeping classified documents after leaving the White House.\n\nTrump also has pushed on the issue of immunity in Georgia, where he is charged with conspiracy to undo the state's 2020 election results.\n\nTrump's other indictment is in New York, where he will face trial later this month in connection with allegedly falsifying records to hide hush money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels during his 2016 election.\n\nSandy Fitzgerald \u2709\n\nSandy Fitzgerald has more than

Trump's presidential immunity appeal is one of multiple high-profile cases the Supreme Court is considering this term involving the former president.\n\n\"The Special Counsel's request to treat the stay application as a petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, and that petition is granted limited to the following question: Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office,\" the Supreme Court wrote in an order last week agreeing to take up Trump's case.\n\nIn April, the Supreme Court is slated to hear another case, Fischer v. United States, dealing with the scope of an obstruction statute used to charge hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants, which could also have a major impact on Trump's case, as the statute is connected to two of the charges in his indictment.\n\nThe Supreme Court also ruled Monday that Trump could not be disqualified from Colorado's ballot. It held that Congress, not states, is responsible for enforcing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, which restricts individuals who took an oath to the Constitution and then \"engaged in insurrection\" from holding office. (RELATED: Supreme Court Rules Trump Cannot Be Removed From Colorado Ballot)\n\n\"In light of the Supreme Court taking up the presidential immunity case, I seriously doubt the D.C. federal trial will take place before the election,\" John Malcolm, vice president for the Heritage Foundation's Institute for Constitutional Government and former deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ's Criminal Division, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \"In addition to the fact that the Supreme Court will have to issue its decision in that case and the Fischer case - both of which will likely occur in late June - and assuming that the Supreme Court rules against former President Trump, there are still several pretrial matters pending before Judge Chutkan that would have to be resolved before a trial could begin.\"\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan initially rejected Trump's bid to dismiss his case based on presidential immunity in December. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed in February that he is not immune from prosecution.\n\nOver the past months, Special Counsel Jack Smith has sought to speed up the process to keep Trump's trial on track. The Supreme Court rejected his request in December to take up the question before letting the appeals court weigh in.\n\nMalcolm noted there is also a \"DOJ policy that says that the Justice Department should not do anything close to an election that might impact that election\" that would \"likely come into play for any trial that would begin in the fall.\"\n\n\"And there is the issue that the classified documents case in Florida may be going on this summer, which will last a few weeks,\" he added.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

More specifically, they agreed to consider the question: \"Whether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\"\n\nThe April date is roughly five months after Special Counsel Jack Smith requested the court expedite President Trump's appeal and bypass the usual course in which a lower court of appeals hears the case.\n\nPresident Trump ultimately lost his appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which rejected his argument that presidents must be impeached and convicted by Congress before they can face criminal prosecution in Article III courts.\n\nMr. Smith and D.C. Judge Tanya Chutkan were aiming for a March 4 start date for President Trump's trial but that ultimately got postponed by his appeal in the D.C. Circuit. The Supreme Court's latest move gives President Trump more time and throws the trial as a whole into jeopardy as he is arguing that each of the activities alleged in Mr. Smith's indictment are protected by presidential immunity.\n\nMr. Smith has emphasized what he described as public interest in a quick trial while President Trump and an amicus brief from 22 states have criticized the pace of the prosecution.\n\nOn Feb. 28, the court announced it would hear oral argument in President Trump's immunity appeal while effectively halting proceedings before Judge Chutkan. It's unclear whether the Supreme Court will release a decision within a month as it did in the Colorado case. The justices are already facing public scrutiny over their decision to take the case and will likely feel pressure to release something quickly so that lower court proceedings can continue.\n\nThe D.C. Circuit issued its decision on President Trump's immunity appeal roughly a month after oral argument. It gave the Supreme Court a lengthy opinion to work with but one that the justices could nonetheless reject.\n\nThe immunity appeal case is the second major case the court is scheduled to hear surrounding President Trump's conduct on Jan. 6, 2021. Following another argument in February, the justices issued a unanimous judgment on March 4 that overturned the Colorado Supreme Court's ruling that President Trump was disqualified from appearing on the state's ballot.\n\nLike that case, the presidential immunity case will likely feature big questions about various constitutional provisions and the delineation of authority between different aspects of the American government. The court's March 4 judgment effectively ruled that Congress, rather than state and federal courts, could disqualify candidates for federal office.\n\nIn his immunity appeal, President Trump similarly argued that Congress had authority that superseded involvement by the judiciary. His brief warned that without his interpretation of immunity, presidents would see destructive cycles of recrimination that would hinder their ability to make decisions.\n\nMr. Smith, meanwhile, has maintained that existing safeguards in the criminal justice system would prevent abusive prosecutions and that President Trump's position found \"no support in constitutional text, separation-of-powers principles, history, or logic.\"\n\nWhatever the court decides, it will likely set a landmark precedent that could affect future elections and decisions by all three branches of the federal government.\n\nWhile the Constitution doesn't explicitly grant presidential immunity, its provisions have been interpreted to protect certain forms of presidential decision-making from judicial review. Prior court decisions have been understood to protect presidents from civil liability for actions that fell within the official duties of their office.

The high court's decision to consider Trump's claims, rather than letting stand a lower court decision that he can be prosecuted, drew criticism for further delaying the election obstruction trial. It was originally scheduled to begin this week.\n\nThe former president, who is on the cusp of securing the 2024 Republican nomination, has tried to push the D.C. trial and others he faces until after the general election. If Trump is reelected, he could try to order the Justice Department to drop the federal charges against him. In addition, it is Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.\n\nLast week, the justices announced their plans to consider the unanimous ruling from a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which rejected Trump's sweeping assertion of immunity from prosecution. On Wednesday, the court set oral argument for April 25, adding another day to its calendar.\n\nTrump's pretrial proceedings in D.C. remain on hold until a ruling is issued. The high court could decide the matter at any time after argument and almost certainly will do so before its term ends in late June or early July, most likely pushing any D.C. trial into the second half of the summer or the fall.\n\nThe justices have shown they can move quickly. They took less than a month to issue a unanimous ruling Monday that keeps Trump on the ballot and reverses a Colorado opinion that disqualified him from returning to office.\n\nWhatever the court decides in the D.C. immunity case could also have implications for Trump's other legal troubles. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases, has raised immunity issues in his federal case in Florida, where he is charged with illegally retaining classified materials after he left the White House and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump has also brought up the issue of presidential immunity in Georgia, where he faces state charges for allegedly participating in a massive conspiracy to undo the 2020 election results in that state.\n\nHis fourth indictment comes from New York, where he is scheduled for trial starting later this month on charges of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to an adult-film star during the 2016 election.

The court's ruling is highly anticipated after the election conspiracy case, prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith in Washington, DC, essentially came to a halt when Mr Trump came forward with his defence.\n\nSo far, Mr Trump's defence has been shot down at both the appeals court and by the federal judge overseeing the case. Last month, appeals court judges wrote that \"citizen Trump\" is not shielded by executive immunity, and that his \"alleged efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election were, if proven, an unprecedented assault on the structure of our government.\"\n\nThis case comes after Mr Trump's legal team argued in front of the Supreme Court for a separate case, one that challenges a Colorado court ruling that disqualified him from 2024 state ballots under the insurrection clause of the US Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued a decision this week in his favour, ruling that only Congress -- not the states -- has the authority to remove him from the ballot.

It previously had disclosed which week it would hear the matter but had not given the precise date.\n\nThe justices will review a lower court's rejection of Trump's claim of immunity from prosecution because he was president when he took actions aimed at reversing President Joe Biden's election victory over him.\n\nTrump, the first former president to face criminal charges, is poised to become the Republican nominee to challenge the Democratic president in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. His last rival for the nomination, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, pulled out of the race on Wednesday.\n\nThe immunity case again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday handed Trump a major victory by ensuring he will remain on the presidential ballot. The justices barred states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection, reversing a judicial decision to exclude him from Colorado's ballot for his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \"unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case. A March 4 trial date was postponed as Trump pressed his immunity claim, with no new date yet set.\n\nTrump has three other pending criminal cases, with a trial in New York state court concerning hush money paid to a porn star set to begin on March 25. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of them, seeking to portray them as politically motivated.\n\nSmith's charges accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote.\n\nTrump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.\n\nIn a separate case to be argued on April 16, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a man involved in the Capitol attack can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding - the congressional certification of the 2020 election results. That case has potential implications for Trump because Smith brought two obstruction-related charges.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

United States will be argued on the last day of the high court's 2023 term.\n\nJustices only last week indicated they would hear the immunity question.\n\nThe order stated only that the court would resolve the question of \"whether and if so to what extent does a former president enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office[.]\"\n\nIn the days that followed the decision to take up the case, the justices unanimously ruled in favor of letting Trump remain on the ballot in Colorado after a half-dozen voters tried and failed to remove him after he was found to have engaged in insurrection, a constitutionally disqualifying criteria under Section III of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Trump's bid for what he has described as a \"absolute immunity\" as president, rejecting his attorney's lofty claims that under certain circumstances, a former president could even get away with murdering his political rivals.", "source": {"uri": "lawandcrime.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Law & Crime"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It previously had disclosed which week it would hear the matter but had not given the precise date.\n\nThe justices will review a lower court's rejection of Trump's claim of immunity from prosecution because he was president when he took actions aimed at reversing President Joe Biden's election victory over him.\n\nTrump, the first former president to face criminal charges, is poised to become the Republican nominee to challenge the Democratic president in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. His last rival for the nomination, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, pulled out of the race on Wednesday.\n\nThe immunity case again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday handed Trump a major victory by ensuring he will remain on the presidential ballot. The justices barred states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection, reversing a judicial decision to exclude him from Colorado's ballot for his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \"unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case. A March 4 trial date was postponed as Trump pressed his immunity claim, with no new date yet set.\n\nTrump has three other pending criminal cases, with a trial in New York state court concerning hush money paid to a porn star set to begin on March 25. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of them, seeking to portray them as politically motivated.\n\nSmith's charges accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote.\n\nTrump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.\n\nIn a separate case to be argued on April 16, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a man involved in the Capitol attack can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding - the congressional certification of the 2020 election results. That case has potential implications for Trump because Smith brought two obstruction-related charges.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com",

Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of them, seeking to portray them as politically motivated.\n\nSmith's charges accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote.\n\nTrump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes.\n\nIn a separate case to be argued on April 16, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a man involved in the Capitol attack can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding - the congressional certification of the 2020 election results. That case has potential implications for Trump because Smith brought two obstruction-related charges.\n\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; Editing by Will Dunham)", "source": {"uri":

It says that Trump repeatedly told supporters and others that he had won the election, despite knowing that was false, and describes how he tried to persuade state officials, then-Vice President Mike Pence and finally Congress to overturn the legitimate results.\n\nAfter a weekslong campaign of lies about the election results, prosecutors allege, Trump sought to exploit the violence at the Capitol by pointing to it as a reason to further delay the counting of votes that sealed his defeat.\n\nIn their charging documents, prosecutors referenced a half-dozen unindicted co-conspirators, including lawyers inside and outside of government who they said had worked with Trump to undo the election results and advanced legally dubious schemes to enlist slates of fake electors in battleground states won by Biden.\n\nThe Trump campaign called the charges \"fake\" and asked why it took two and a half years to bring them. He has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe case had been set for trial on March 4 in federal court in Washington. But that date was canceled amid an appeal by Trump on the legally untested question of whether a former president is immune from prosecution for official acts taken in the White House.\n\nThe Supreme Court injected fresh uncertainty into the trial date, saying Wednesday that it would hear arguments in late April. That leaves it unclear whether a trial can be completed before the November election.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has been leading two federal probes related to Trump, both of which have resulted in charges against the former president.\n\nThe first charges to result from those investigations came in June when Trump was indicted for mishandling top secret documents at his Florida estate. The indictment alleges that Trump repeatedly enlisted aides and lawyers to help him hide records demanded by investigators and cavalierly showed off a Pentagon \"plan of attack\" and classified map.\n\nA superseding indictment issued in July added charges accusing Trump of asking for surveillance footage at his Mar-a-Lago estate to be deleted after FBI and Justice Department investigators visited in June 2022 to collect classified documents he took with him after leaving the White House. The new indictment also charges him with illegally holding onto a document he's alleged to have shown off to visitors in New Jersey.\n\nIn all, Trump faces 40 felony charges in the classified documents case. The most serious charge carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nWalt Nauta, a valet for Trump, and Carlos De Oliveira, the property manager at Trump's Florida estate, have been charged in the case with scheming to conceal surveillance footage from federal investigators and lying about it.\n\nTrump, Nauta and De Oliveira have pleaded not guilty.\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon set a trial date of May 20, 2024, though she has signaled that it may be pushed back.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith has been leading two federal probes related to Trump, both of which have resulted in charges against the former president.\n\nThe first charges to result from those investigations came in June when Trump was indicted for mishandling top secret documents at his Florida estate.

You might find it outrageous that those people -- a coalition of elected Democrats, Biden administration appointees, Democratic Party activists and career lawfare specialists -- are in fact desperately pushing the system to work faster to win verdicts by Election Day. But there it is.\n\nThe anti-Trump coalition has launched six main attacks on the former president who has locked up his third nomination to run for the post.\n\nAttack No. 1 is the federal indictment, brought by the Justice Department-appointed special counsel Jack Smith, charging Trump with 40 felony counts in the classified documents case. No. 2 is the federal indictment, also brought by Smith, charging Trump with four felonies in the 2020 election and Jan. 6 case. No. 3 is the sprawling, 13-felony count racketeering indictment, based on the 2020 election, brought against Trump and 18 co-defendants in Georgia by the elected Democratic Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.\n\nAttack No. 4 is the 34-felony-count indictment, based on the payment of hush money in the 2016 election, brought by the elected Democratic Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. No. 5 is the effort, launched by various activists around the country, to remove Trump from presidential ballots by declaring him an \"insurrectionist\" under the terms of Section Three of the 14th Amendment. And No. 6 is the effort to bankrupt Trump by way of a lawsuit brought by the elected Democratic New York State Attorney General Letitia James.\n\nNow, with their efforts in the news daily, it might be a good time to see where things stand. Go through them in reverse order of importance, that is, starting with the cases least likely to hurt Trump this year:\n\n* The 14th Amendment removal campaign. It's over. Having all nine Supreme Court justices agree that no state can take Trump off the ballot is as decisive as it gets. Still -- and keep an eye on this -- you might see the 14th Amendment argument revived if Trump wins and congressional Democrats look for a way to prevent him from taking office.\n\n* The Georgia case. What can be said about it? Right now, everyone is waiting for a judge to decide whether to remove Willis from the case on the basis of charges of misconduct raised by a number of defense lawyers. If Willis is removed, the entire case might collapse for want of another prosecutor to pursue it.\n\n* The federal classified documents case. It was always going to be hard to do this year, given that it involves millions of documents, security clearances and special handling of evidence. The judge in the case has entertained suggestions of starting the trial in mid-summer, but that seems extremely unlikely, and a verdict before election day seems even more unlikely.\n\n* The New York lawsuit. Unlike the others, this has been a ringing success for the people seeking Trump's financial ruin. Trying flimsy and blatantly unfair charges before a compliant judge -- under New York law, Trump did not have the right to a jury trial -- James won a $454 million judgment against the former president. Even if he manages to reduce the award on appeal, Trump has still been damaged. And James is having a ball taunting him on social media.\n\n* The federal 2020 election and Jan. 6 case. This is the showpiece case, the one so many anti-Trump forces have pinned their hopes on, because they see it as the prime vehicle to hold Trump \"accountable\" -- one of their favorite words -- for his efforts to challenge the 2020 election results. The trial was originally scheduled to begin this week but has been delayed by Trump's claim that he should be immune from charges over acts he took as president. Prosecutor Smith is scrambling to keep the case on track, but the Supreme Court will rule not only on the immunity issue, which Trump is expected to lose, but also on two of the four charges against Trump, which some argue simply do not apply to the case.\n\n* The Manhattan case. Bragg was the first to file criminal charges against Trump. It's safe to say he got little respect for it. Even Trump's adversaries admitted that the Bragg charges were weak; it's really a bunch of misdemeanors that Bragg conjured into felonies through a legally questionable maneuver. The other cases, bad as some of them are, got more respect and attention, and Bragg stepped into the background, offering to delay trying his case while the others went first. But now all those cases have encountered problems, and Bragg is steaming ahead to a March 25 trial date, less than three weeks away.\n\nThe reason for the Democratic panic is this: Some in the party think, \"Sure, President Joe Biden is weak, and his polls are terrible, but if he falters, there is always lawfare. We've thrown case after case against Trump. Surely one of them will work.\" Now, there has been a lot of movement with the big six cases. Five of them might not be resolved, or resolved in Biden's favor, before the election. So it could be that the entire hopes of the Democratic Party and all those who seek to bring down Trump before Election Day rest with Bragg.\n\n(Byron York is chief political correspondent for The

Those charges stemmed from Smith's investigation into whether Trump was involved in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and any alleged interference in the 2020 election result.\n\nTRUMP SAYS SUPREME COURT RULING IN COLORADO CASE IS 'UNIFYING AND INSPIRATIONAL'\n\nTrump pleaded not guilty to all charges in August.\n\nThis will be the second time this term the Supreme Court will hear a case involving the presumed Republican presidential nominee.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court sided unanimously with the 2024 GOP frontrunner in his challenge to Colorado's attempt to kick him off the 2024 primary ballot.\n\nThe high court ruled in favor of Trump's arguments in the case, which will impact the status of efforts in several other states to remove the likely GOP nominee from their respective ballots.\n\nThe court considered for the first time the meaning and reach of Article 3 of the 14th Amendment, which bars former officeholders who \"engaged in insurrection\" from holding public office again. Challenges have been filed to remove Trump from the 2024 ballot in over 30 states.\n\nTRUMP SPEAKS AFTER SUPREME COURT RULING, TELLS BIDEN TO 'FIGHT YOUR FIGHT YOURSELF'\n\nIn reacting to that ruling on Monday, Trump shifted his sights to the issue of presidential immunity.\n\n\"A great win for America.

Kathleen is a proud alumna of the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism. Here's a shocker; she is from New York City.\n\nThe Supreme Court will hear arguments on former President Donald Trump's presidential immunity claim on April 25, the very last day of hearings for this current term, according to records and reports.\n\nEconomist reporter Steven Mazie shared the news of the hearing -- to debate a matter at the heart of special counsel Jack Smith's federal election interference case against Trump -- on X Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe post was immediately flooded with comments accusing the Court of spurring a delay to benefit Trump, an argument also raised in recent weeks by columnists at the Washington Post.\n\n\"They are making it crystal clear that their intention is to delay this decision as long as possible,\" replied X user Deb. \"This SCOTUS majority is disgusting.\"\n\nDelay has been the name of the game for Trump, the lone-standing Republican candidate in the 2024 presidential race, because he could effectively kill Smith's case against him should he regain the White House in 2025, legal experts say.\n\nTrump's presidential immunity defense -- which argues he cannot be prosecuted for any official acts as a standing U.S. president -- has stalled the Washington D.C. case for months as the argument worked its way through the appeals court system.\n\nThat process began with the Supreme Court refusing in December to expedite the process and kicking the decision to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled in early February that blanket presidential immunity would undermine the foundations of democracy.\n\nALSO READ: Fresh scrutiny for Marjorie Taylor Greene after election violation\n\nAfter two weeks of waiting, the Supreme Court announced on Feb. 28 that it would consider the question again.\n\n\"The decision is a significant victory for Trump for at least two reasons,\" CNN reported at the time. \"He will now be able to argue for sweeping presidential immunity that, if granted, could undermine the bevy of legal challenges he faces, and he will also be able to push off a trial, likely for several weeks at least.\"\n\nCritics of the high court note three of the nine judges were appointed by Trump -- Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas faces direct calls for recusal over the conflict of interest presented by his wife Ginny's participation in Trump's efforts to challenge the 2020 election.",

The high court's decision to consider Trump's claims, rather than letting stand a lower court decision that he can be prosecuted, drew criticism for further delaying the election obstruction trial. It was originally scheduled to begin this week.\n\nThe former president, who is on the cusp of securing the 2024 Republican nomination, has tried to push the D.C. trial and others he faces until after the general election. If Trump is reelected, he could try to order the Justice Department to drop the federal charges against him. In addition, it is Justice Department policy not to prosecute a sitting president.\n\nLast week, the justices announced their plans to consider the unanimous ruling from a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which rejected Trump's sweeping assertion of immunity from prosecution. On Wednesday, the court set oral argument for April 25, adding another day to its calendar.\n\nTrump's pretrial proceedings in D.C. remain on hold until a ruling is issued. The high court could decide the matter at any time after argument and almost certainly will do so before its term ends in late June or early July, most likely pushing any D.C. trial into the second half of the summer or the fall.\n\nThe justices have shown they can move quickly. They took less than a month to issue a unanimous ruling Monday that keeps Trump on the ballot and reverses a Colorado opinion that disqualified him from returning to office.\n\nWhatever the court decides in the D.C. immunity case could also have implications for Trump's other legal troubles. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty in all four of his criminal cases, has raised immunity issues in his federal case in Florida, where he is charged with illegally retaining classified materials after he left the White House and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.\n\nTrump has also brought up the issue of presidential immunity in Georgia, where he faces state charges for allegedly participating in a massive conspiracy to undo the 2020 election results in that state.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_argument", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oral argument"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/2JfN_kfRchMhT3imKD9mgtpZDFY=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/D2OFCOGNZXHYVKYLWFBPJMQCJM.jpg", "eventUri": "eng-9365807", "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 447450473, "relevance": 1}

The court released its updated argument calendar a week after it agreed to take up the case and gave the former president a boost by putting on hold the criminal prosecution being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has set April 25 as the date it will hear Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity from prosecution on charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss - the last day of oral arguments of its current term.\n\nThe court released its updated argument calendar a week after it agreed to take up the case and gave the former president a boost by putting on hold the criminal prosecution being pursued by Special Counsel Jack Smith. It previously had disclosed which week it would hear the matter but had not given the precise date. The justices will review a lower court's rejection of Trump's claim of immunity from prosecution because he was president when he took actions aimed at reversing President Joe Biden's election victory over him.\n\nTrump, the first former president to face criminal charges, is poised to become the Republican nominee to challenge the Democratic president in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. His last rival for the nomination, former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, pulled out of the race on Wednesday. The immunity case again thrusts the nation's top judicial body, whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices appointed by Trump, into the election fray.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday handed Trump a major victory by ensuring he will remain on the presidential ballot. The justices barred states from disqualifying candidates for federal office under a constitutional provision involving insurrection, reversing a judicial decision to exclude him from Colorado's ballot for his conduct related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on Feb. 6 ruled 3-0 against Trump's immunity claim, rejecting his bid for \"unbounded authority to commit crimes that would neutralize the most fundamental check on executive power - the recognition and implementation of election results.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Smith brought four federal criminal counts against Trump in the election subversion case. A March 4 trial date was postponed as Trump pressed his immunity claim, with no new date yet set. Trump has three other pending criminal cases, with a trial in New York state court concerning hush money paid to a porn star set to begin on March 25. Trump has pleaded not guilty in all of them, seeking to portray them as politically motivated.\n\nSmith's charges accused Trump of conspiring to defraud the United States, obstructing the congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory and conspiring to do so, and conspiring against right of Americans to vote. Trump and his allies made false claims that the 2020 election was stolen and devised a plan to use false electors to thwart congressional certification of Biden's victory. Trump also sought to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence not to allow certification to go forward. Trump's supporters attacked the Capitol in a bid to prevent the certification.\n\nIf Trump regains the presidency, he could seek to use his powers to force an end to the prosecution or potentially pardon himself for any federal crimes. In a separate case to be argued on April 16, the Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether a man involved in the Capitol attack can be charged with obstructing an official proceeding - the congressional certification of the 2020 election results. That case has potential implications for Trump because Smith brought two obstruction-related charges.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

What's at stake isn't just the fate of the former president, but an essential aspect of democracy.\n\nThe Georgia Case\n\nRecently, the country was privy to attempts by Donald Trump's lawyers to delay, if not completely derail, legal proceedings in a Georgia courtroom where Trump faces 13 felony counts for, in essence, trying to steal an election. In a hearing linked to that Georgia election interference case, originally scheduled to begin in August, a team of Trump defense attorneys attempted to remove prosecuting District Attorney Fani Willis from the case. The defense team has argued that Willis was not only having an affair with a man she had appointed as lead prosecutor in that case but had gained financially from doing so.\n\nShould the judge indeed order her removed, the trial could be delayed until well past the November presidential election and might never take place at all. A new prosecutor could decide not to bring charges against Trump and his 14 co-defendants, and even finding one could prove painfully difficult, given the size, complexity, and cost of the case. According to NBC News politics reporter Dareh Gregorian, it would be a \"massive undertaking.\" Not to mention that selecting a new prosecutor could spark all sorts of internal politics in the Georgia justice system. The \"delay,\" in other words, could well amount to an utter defeat. Originally scheduled to be decided before the 2024 presidential election, the trial would, at best, be postponed into the distant future and might never take place.\n\nAnd that's not the only case in which Trump's team is deploying a strategy of delay in the service of strangling future legal proceedings.\n\nThe Jack Smith Federal Cases\n\nSpecial Counsel Jack Smith -- appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland in November 2022 after more than a year of persistent calls for an investigation into the January 6th insurrection -- has mounted two federal criminal cases against Trump. One involves classified documents he took back to his Mar-a-Lago estate and refused to return. It's now before a Florida federal court (and a Trump-appointed judge). The other is the January 6th election interference case taking place in Washington, D.C. Both have repeatedly succumbed to \"assorted motions and maneuvers\" of delay, as Mother Jones columnist David Corn aptly puts it.\n\nIn truth, delay has been front and center in each case. Only recently, Trump's lawyers petitioned the Supreme Court to put Smith's potentially devastating election interference case on hold while the former president appealed a lower court ruling that he doesn't have presidential immunity from federal prosecution. He has now filed an appeal with the Supreme Court, asking the justices to determine whether or not he indeed does have immunity. This comes after the D.C. appellate court took over a month to issue its decision, just one more way in which timeliness has been left in the lurch at a moment when time should be of the essence.\n\nIn a second delaying maneuver in that case, the former president's lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to pause proceedings until the trial of another January 6th defendant -- subject to similar charges -- concludes. Originally scheduled to begin on March 4th, the case has already been successfully stalled, though it could still, at least theoretically, begin in July, overlapping with the Republican National Convention or even during the fall election period itself.\n\nIn a similar fashion, Trump's legal team has sought to push off Smith's second case, the one involving those boxes of classified documents, some of which Trump so tellingly piled up in his Mar-a-Lago bathroom and shower. That case involves a 37-count indictment, including charges of willfully retaining national security documents, withholding and mishandling classified documents, and the purposeful obstruction of justice. Repeatedly, Trump's lawyers have asked for delays in the case, including a request that Judge Aileen Cannon postpone the trial until after the November election. That Trump-appointed judge has indeed agreed to some delays but so far has kept the trial's starting date at May 20th. In frustration at the slow pace of that case, Smith has called the Trump team's persistent attempts at delay \"relentless and misleading.\" According to New York Times reporters Alan Feuer and Maggie Haberman, the trial date \"will almost certainly be delayed\" -- the only question is how long the delay will be.\n\nThe New York State Case\n\nAs in the Georgia case, the fourth criminal indictment against the former president is taking place in state court. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has indicted him in what's commonly known as \"the hush-money case.\" What's at stake, however, is not only the silencing of porn star Stormy Daniels with whom Trump had an affair just before the 2016 election. The indictment accuses him of \"falsifying New York business records in order to conceal damaging information and unlawful activity from American voters before and after the 2016 election.\" As Bragg explained to WNYC's Brian Lehrer, \"The core is not money for sex. We would say it's about conspiring to corrupt a presidential election and then lying in New York business records to cover it up. That's the heart of the case as we've laid out in court filings.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karen_j_greenberg@thenation.com", "name": "Karen J.

Special Counsel Jack Smith's charges against Trump in Washington, D.C., were initially scheduled for March 4. However, the Supreme Court agreed in February to hear Trump's presidential immunity claim in late April, which could disrupt Smith's preferred timeline. Smith is charging Trump with allegedly attempting to overturn the 2020 election on January 6, 2021,\n\n\"The real question is what these trial judges are gonna do,\" Turley said on \"Fox & Friends.\" \"Judge Chutkan in D.C. said, 'I'm not gonna consider at all that you're running for president.' And that surprised a lot of us because if the Supreme Court rules against Trump on immunity, and sends that mandate back to the district court, and she decides to put the pedal to the medal and actually hold a trial before the election, that trial could conceivably go through the election.\"\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon initially scheduled a trial date for Trump's classified documents case for May 20 but ended a recent hearing without setting a new date, NBC News reported. The Department of Justice (DOJ) proposed a July 8 date, and Trump's team floated Aug. 12. (RELATED: Jonathan Turley Lays Out How The Supreme Court Just Threw A Wrench Into Jack Smith's Holiday Plans)\n\nJudge Juan Merchan announced Trump's trial in New York City will begin March 25 in relation to allegedly paying hush money to former porn star Stormy Daniels regarding their alleged extramarital affair.\n\nTurley said as a criminal defense lawyer, he had never seen a trial get scheduled in this speed.\n\n\"Look, I practiced in D.C. I've never seen a case like this get scheduled for trial in this speed. As a criminal defense attorney, my hair would catch on fire if a judge said, 'You know what, I'm gonna give you a couple of months on pre-trial, and we're gonna rush this thing through,\" Turley added.\n\nHe then added the \"optics\" of Trump being in a courtroom is beneficial for his presidential run since the American people believe the establishment \"is putting a thumb on this scale.\"\n\nTrump is facing a total of four indictments and 91 charges in New York, Washington D.C., Florida and Georgia. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg became the first to indict Trump in August with 34 counts of allegedly falsifying business records to keep the alleged affair with Daniels undisclosed.\n\nSmith charged Trump with violating the Espionage Act in Florida for allegedly having classified documents in Mar-a-Lago and handed Trump another indictment for allegedly attempting to overturn the 2020 election. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis charged the former president, along with 18 others, with allegedly attempting to overturn the election results in the state of Georgia.", "source": {"uri":

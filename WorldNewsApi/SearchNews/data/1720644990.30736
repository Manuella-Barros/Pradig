A \u201chobby horser\u201d \u2013 who gallops and jumps hurdles with the children\u2019s stick toy \u2013 fired back at critics who dissed the activity as \u201ceasy\u201d in a video that has since gone viral. \u201c\u2018Hobbyhorsing is not a sport, it\u2019s easy and everyone can do that\u2019 . . . Oh yeah?\u201d Anna sarcastically asks in May 28 TikTok\u2018s caption. The 37-second-long video then shows the flushed 16-year-old \u2013 who has a Czech Republic flag in her TikTok bio \u2013 violently coughing and hyperventilating on a gym floor, while other wannabe-jockeys jump hurdles in the background. \u201cThis is me after my dressage routine \u2026 I was passing out, couldn\u2019t breathe, almost throwing up, dizzy, shaking, whole body burning in pain,\u201d reads the clip, which has amassed a 47 million views. One commenter snarked, \u201cThe best part in hobby horsing is that u dont have to do it!\u201d That comment generated over 1,300 \u201clikes.\u201d Dozens of TikTokers have since mocked Anna\u2019s meltdown in their own videos, in which they reenact the episode using her same caption. But Anna seems to be moving \u2013 neigh \u2013 trotting right along, according to five TikTok videos she\u2019s posted within the last week. In a clip captioned \u201cBack to the moment i won national championship\u201d posted on Thursday, Anna dramatically bursts into tears \u2013 presumably when she is announced as the winner of the competition \u2013 as she stands alongside three other hobby horsers. \u201cOne of the happiest moments of my life,\u201d the caption continues as Coldplay\u2019s \u201cViva La Vida\u201d plays. \u201cHobby horsing\u201d originated in Finland in 2002, and had attracted around 10,000 10- to 18-year-olds by 2017, according to the Associated Press. It has spread to other countries like the UK.", "summary": "This is me after my dressage routine...

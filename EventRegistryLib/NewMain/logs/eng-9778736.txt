It's very hard to speculate,\" Blinken said in an interview with Channel News Asia during a visit to Singapore.\n\nIran's Revolutionary Guards confirmed Haniyeh's death, hours after he attended a

war set off by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7 has raged in Gaza.\n\n\"I've learned over many years never to speculate on the impact one event may have on something else,\" Blinken said when asked what impact Haniyeh's death might have on the war.\n\nThe assassination, less than 24 hours after Israel claimed to have killed a Hezbollah commander it said was behind a deadly strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, could be a major setback for chances of a ceasefire agreement in the 10-month-old war.\n\nBlinken, who has been in Asia since late last week, said a ceasefire and the release of hostages being held in Gaza was crucial and the United States would do everything to make that happen.\n\n\"It's vitally important to hopefully put things on a better path for more enduring

groups also seized 251 hostages, 111 of whom are still held captive in Gaza, including 39 the military says are dead.\n\nIsrael's brutal military campaign has killed nearly 40,000 people in Gaza, according to the Health Ministry.\n\nBlinken said achieving a cease-fire was \"manifestly in the interests of the hostages and bringing them home, it's manifestly in the interests of Palestinians who are suffering terribly every single day, children, women, men in Gaza.\"\n\n\"... it's profoundly in the interest of trying to put things on a better path not only in Gaza, but actually throughout the

So there is a lot of anger,\" she said.\n\nIsrael has yet to comment on the attack but had previously promised to kill Haniyeh and other Hamas leaders after the group's October 7 attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,139 people and triggered the country's war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael also carried out a bombing in Beirut just hours before Haniyeh was killed, saying it targeted Fuad Shukr, a commander of Lebanese group Hezbollah. At least three people, including two children, were killed and 74 others wounded.\n\nHaniyeh, 62, had been involved in negotiations to try to secure a ceasefire in Gaza, where Israeli attacks have killed at least 39,445 Palestinians since early October.\n\nThe prime minister of Qatar, which has acted as a mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, questioned the chances of the talks succeeding following the assassination.\n\n\"How can mediation succeed when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side?\" Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani posted on social media.\n\nIn Wednesday's interview with Channel News Asia, the US's Blinken said \"the imperative of getting a ceasefire, the importance that that has for everyone, remains\".\n\n\"We will continue to labour that for as long as it takes to get there,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"It's vitally important to help end the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza.

Vice-President Kamala Harris is now seen as the likely Democratic nominee against the Republican Party's candidate and former president, Donald Trump.\n\nGiven Trump's recent comments as well as past actions in his first administration, fears are that a second Trump presidency would lead to a reconfiguration of US strategic interests, diminishing the role of the world's largest economy in global affairs while further escalating tensions with China.\n\nAs it stands, the Biden administration has increased tariffs on Chinese products in several strategic sectors such as steel and aluminium, semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes, and medical products.\n\nMr Blinken said Beijing is at manufacturing overcapacity in some industries and sectors, producing well beyond what both China and the world need. In addition, it is doing so with subsidies and other forms of support that not only create unfair disadvantages but also threaten to flood other markets and ruin local communities and businesses.\n\n\"We're in a competition... We want to make sure that that competition doesn't veer into conflict, which is profoundly not in our interests or in anyone else's, nor in China's,\" he added.\n\nIn Singapore, Mr Blinken called on Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his first visit to the South-east Asian city-state as the US's most senior diplomat.\n\nHe co-chaired the second annual US-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology Dialogue on July 31. This is a bilateral initiative that was started in October 2023 and is aimed at deepening collaboration in building trusted, open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystems.\n\nMr Blinken also inked two agreements with Singapore's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan.\n\nThe first renews the partnership between the two countries to collaborate on building the capacity of nations in the region in public health, the digital economy, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, with a view to advancing development priorities.\n\nThe second is a civil nuclear agreement aimed at helping Singapore explore the feasibility of tapping all potential options to decarbonise its power sector.\n\nOn a busy day for Mr Blinken in Singapore, Tehran and the militant group Hamas announced that Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh had been assassinated early in the morning of July 31 in Iran.\n\nThe development sparked fears of further escalation in tensions as the war in Gaza drags on and the potential festers of another conflict in Lebanon. Both Iran and Hamas have accused Israel of killing Mr Haniyeh, while Israel has not commented on his death.\n\nMr Blinken told CNA that the US was not aware of or involved in Haniyeh's killing.\n\n\"So much is tied to what's happening in Gaza right now,\" he said, in response to an audience question at the ACM dialogue.\n\n\"We've been working from day one, not only to try to get to a better place in Gaza, but also to prevent the conflict from spreading, whether it's the north with Lebanon and Hezbollah, whether it's the sea with the Houthis, whether it's Iran, Syria, Iraq, you name it,\" he said.\n\n\"And a big key to trying to make sure that that doesn't happen and that we can move to a better place is getting the ceasefire,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

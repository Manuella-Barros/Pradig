It faced an extended selling spree in a volatile session on Thursday where institutional profit-taking, coupled with a slump in global crude prices and lower exports from Pakistan, dragged the KSE-100 below the 71,000-point threshold.\n\nAfter coming under pressure for three consecutive sessions, a highly bullish momentum swept through the PSX on Friday, with the KSE-100 skyrocketing by over 1,200 points and reaching close to the 72,000 mark.\n\nOverall, the benchmark KSE-100 index lost 841 points, or 1.16% week-on-week (WoW), and closed at 71,902.09.\n\nJS Global analyst Shagufta Irshad, in her report, wrote that the KSE-100 index took a breather with a 1.2% WoW correction in the outgoing week, after touching a new high last week.\n\nAverage traded volumes dipped by 21% while average traded value in dollar terms dropped by 8%.\n\nThe correction was overdue as the central bank's monetary policy meeting decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 22% for the sixth time, she said.\n\nInflation for April 2024 receded to 17.3%, a 23-month low, while the SBP's foreign exchange reserves remained at $8 billion.\n\nThe IMF executive board approved the final $1.1 billion loan tranche, which was expected to take reserves to $9 billion in the next weekly update.\n\nThe April 2024 trade deficit stood at a 15-month high at $2.4 billion, reflecting a 10% year-on-year (YoY) increase in exports compared to a 58% jump in imports.\n\nAmong other news, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected less-than-targeted revenue during April, which took 10MFY24 shortfall to Rs48 billion.\n\nAdditionally, the government slashed petrol price by Rs5.4 per litre and diesel rate by Rs8.4 per litre. In the currency market, the rupee reached a 15-month high against yen, which encouraged auto assemblers to announce price cuts to boost sales, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, said that the KSE-100 index endured persistent pressure throughout the week as the market anticipated a rate cut, but it was left unchanged at 22%.\n\nOn the economic front, trade deficit shrank by 17% YoY for 10MFY24, settling at $19.5 billion. During 3QFY24, the economy recorded its first negative primary balance for the current fiscal year, amounting to Rs197 billion.\n\nSector-wise, negative contributors to the index were technology and communication (276 points), fertiliser (256 points), commercial banks (201 points), pharmaceuticals (50 points) and chemicals (43 points).\n\nForeign investors bought shares valuing at $8 million during the week under review compared to net buying of $3 million last week.", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Bank_of_Pakistan", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State Bank of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange reserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_trend", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market trend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Board_of_Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Board of Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chemical industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commercial bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilizer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fertilizer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diesel fuel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/21713731297-1/21713731297-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540222", "eventUri": "eng-9540222", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

On the economic front, Pakistan received the last tranche of $1.1 billion under the IMF's Stand-By Arrangement programme. Moreover, headline inflation in April clocked in at 17.34pc year-on-year (lowest since May 2022) compared to 20.7pc in March.\n\nThe trade deficit shrank by 17pc year-on-year for 10MFY24, settling at $19.5bn. Furthermore, during 3QFY24, the economy recorded its first negative primary balance of FY24, amounting to a deficit of Rs197bn.\n\nAlso, the government reduced petrol and diesel prices by Rs5.45 and Rs8.42 per litre. In addition, SBP foreign exchange reserves increased by $25m to $8.0bn in the week ending April 26. During the week, the rupee strengthened by 18 paise to Rs278.21 against the US dollar.\n\nAs a result, the benchmark KSE-100 index closed at 71,902 points after declining by 841 points or 1.16pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise, negative contributions came from technology and communication (276 points), fertiliser (256 points), commercial banks (201 points), pharmaceuticals (50 points), and chemicals (43 points).

Major buying was witnessed in fertiliser ($3.3m) and commercial banks ($2.3m). On the local front, selling was reported by other organisations ($5.6m), followed by individuals ($1.8m).\n\nThe average trading volume plunged 21pc to 516m shares while the average value traded settled at $86m.\n\nAHL said that with anticipation building around positive advancements in the new IMF programme, the market is poised to maintain a positive trajectory in the upcoming week.\n\nThis anticipation is set to buoy market sentiment and bolster investor confidence. Moreover, the allure of stocks trading at attractive levels is expected to serve as an additional catalyst, potentially enticing further investor participation.\n\nHowever, AKD Securities Ltd said market volatility will persist until discussions regarding the budget and IMF are settled.

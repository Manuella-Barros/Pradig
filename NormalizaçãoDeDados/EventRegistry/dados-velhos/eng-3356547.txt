He said: \"Of course, we're going there with optimism. Absolutely. We have a great chance. We're not just going there to make up the numbers. We want Hibs to be a force, not just this season but in years to come.\"\n\nLennon, however, admitted Ibrox was a difficult venue to visit at any time but believes his players will thrive on the atmosphere created by a 50,000 sell-out crowd. He said: \"Look, I've got a lot of experience in that dressing-room. I've got Efe Ambrose, who has won titles, I've got Steven Whittaker who has won titles.\n\n\"I've got players who've won cups, I've got international players. So it's not an atmosphere they won't have experienced before. Ibrox is a great amphitheatre to play in, and you've got to thrive on that. And I think my players will. They have played in many big games now over the past couple of years when their backs have been to the wall and they have come through it very well. They handled the Championship last year, they played well in all the big games. They also handled the cup games against Premiership opposition and the derby games very well. So I've no real worries about my players getting nervous. I know there is good mental strength in there. You've just got to keep showing that week in, week out.\n\n\"You only get two trips to Ibrox and Celtic Park in a season so you've got the make the most of them. What you don't want - and this is a bit rich coming from me - is anyone getting over-emotional. You've got to stay cold and concentrate on the game.\"\n\nLennon is looking forward to returning to Ibrox for the first time in five years having, of course, made the headlines there both as a player and\n\nmanager.\n\nHe said: \"I have missed it, who wouldn't. You miss the drama and the intensity and the theatre of it. That's what it is really, it is theatre, Yes, it's sport, it's entertainment, and there's a darker side to it sometimes. But hopefully that can be kept to within the confines of the game.\"\n\nLennon watched the second half of his last match at Ibrox on a television within the media room having been sent off, the accusation he had used foul and abusive language \"being thrown out within five minutes\" when he was hauled before the beaks at Hampden.\n\nHe said: \"There have been a few surreal things happen to me over the years. I've had great occasions there - Beach Ball Sunday, that sort of thing. It's all been part of the drama. This is different. I'm going there with Hibs but there is still a good rivalry.\"\n\nLennon agreed it was sometimes harder to stay calm on the touchline than as a player but, he declared, he enjoys such occasions. \"Yes, there can be some venomous things said, but there can also be a lot of humour there as well. You can't take yourself too seriously there.\n\n\"You hear some quips from the crowd. You try to put on a straight face but sometimes you can't help but snap. But I enjoy it. I enjoy getting off the bus, I enjoy walking out on to the pitch. I enjoy winning there - when you win it is a great feeling. So I want my players to go and enjoy that experience as well.\"", "timeCrawl": "05:45:00", "sim": 0.8352941274642944, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8748731", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "id": 566, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/MUDs", "id": 567, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

And will hope to stay there this time.\n\nBut if the Irishman's previous visits to Glasgow's south side are anything to go by then we shouldn't expect a quiet affair.\n\nLennon claimed he was \"deprived of doing my job\" after a 3-2 defeat to Rangers as Celtic boss on a day when the Hoops could have clinched the title on enemy territory.\n\nHis last game as a player there also ended in a loss when Celtic went down to Walter Smith's side but he wasn't going to slip away quietly.\n\nSkipper Lennon blew the home fans a kiss as he made his way off at half-time and lifted an imaginary trophy with Gordon Strachan's side already crowned champions.\n\nBut while his final Ibrox fixtures as a Celtic player and manager ended in disappointment, he enjoyed some memorable visits.\n\nLennon won on his Ibrox debut both as a player and manager in 19 trips and lost on only seven occasions.\n\nIt's not a bad record but he was part of, and in charge of, some great Hoops sides in more than a decade with the Parkhead club.\n\nHowever, victory as Hibs boss today would arguably be the best of any of his eight wins with Celtic given the fact the Leith side are 4/1 outsiders.\n\nLennon's Celtic teams were never such lengthy odds so that would make it a bigger achievement for a start.\n\nThe Irishman won't have the backing of 8000 fans like he did with Celtic, Martin O'Neill famously leading him to the Broomloan Road stand in a show of solidarity after he was on the end of abuse.\n\nBut Lennon has revelled in his role as Public Enemy No. 1 at times, cupping his ears as he walked up the tunnel as boss as urged the Light Blue legions to give it their all.\n\nThe 46-year-old might now be representing the green of Hibs but that won't make a blind bit of difference to him or the home fans.\n\nLennon will want to win - and a sell-out crowd will want to taunt him. It even started last week when a section of the Gers fans spotted him in the Fir Park directors on a spying mission for this clash.\n\nThrow in the fact it's the first meeting between the two clubs since the ugly end to the Scottish Cup final and Hibs starting the season with a perfect record and it's an intriguing fixture.\n\nIt's just a pity the TV cameras won't be at Ibrox. Armchair fans would have been in for a treat in only the second week of the season.\n\nJon Daly's astonishing rant at Brendan Rodgers last week ensured the Scottish Premiership kicked off with some fireworks.\n\nAnd now Lennon takes centre stage no week two. The pantomime villain role aside, he will fancy his chances of leading Hibs to only their second top flight Ibrox win in the last decade despite a thumping 6-0 win for Pedro Caixinha's men against Dunfermline in midweek.\n\nColin Calderwood's side were the last to taste victory in the Scottish Premiership seven years ago when they recorded an emphatic 3-0 win.\n\nLennon's Ibrox visits are rarely without controversy, sent off in 2005 and booked on his final appearance as a player to compound a miserable day after a 2-0 loss for the already-crowned champions.\n\nAnd as manager was then sent off - which he described as \"a joke\" - at half-time in 2012 when he was left raging following defender Cha Du-Ri's dismissal by Calum Murray for a challenge on Lee Wallace.\n\nLennon was sent to the stand but opted to watch the second 45 minutes in the media room \"for my own safety\" but he will be back out there today lapping up every minute on his Ibrox return.\n\npoll loading Who will win the clash between Rangers and Hibs? 7000+ VOTES SO FAR Rangers Hibs Draw", "timeCrawl": "05:20:00", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8746871", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Shareware", "id": 65, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "id": 253, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Dance", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Dance", "id": 565, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "id": 597, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/Celtic", "id": 827, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Lotteries", "id": 1095, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "id": 1126, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Sitting alongside Steven Naismith, he said how Rangers wasn't the Rangers he signed for, and he was well within his rights walking out the door.\n\nRangers was on its knees at the time, desperate for every penny it could get. But Naisy and Whitts wanted out.\n\nI'm sure they both regret the way the whole thing was handled because no one came out of it looking good.\n\nHolding a press conference to leave a club, what was that all about?\n\nAs it turned out they got their big money moves with Naisy signing for Everton and Whitts going to Norwich.\n\nIt's maybe only now they look back on it and think they should not have left the way they did.\n\nI once left Rangers on a free. But that happens, it wasn't an issue.\n\nWhittaker and Naismith didn't need to stay and play in the lower leagues of Scottish football.\n\nHad both players come out and said they weren't prepared to go down to the Third Division then I think the vast majority of Gers fans would have accepted that.\n\nThe supporters would have been disappointed, but most of them would have understood where they were coming from and taken it.\n\nThey were two international players at the peak of their careers, so stepping down the levels wasn't going to do them any favours.\n\nBut there's a way to go about things. And in football, like in life, you really shouldn't burn your bridges if you can help it.\n\nThere were other Gers stars at the time who did the same thing by refusing to stay and move their contracts over.\n\nBut the likes of Steven Davis and Kirk Broadfoot did it in a way that meant they will always be welcomed back to Ibrox.\n\nThat's not the case with Whittaker and Naismith.\n\nWhen there was talk of Naisy going back in the summer I had mates saying they wouldn't set foot back inside Ibrox if the wee man signed for Gers.\n\nThey weren't kidding either, they simply weren't having it.\n\nMaybe Whitts isn't bothered, maybe he's happy where he is, back at the club where his career started.\n\nIt's not like he's joined a small club. Hibs are very much on the up and seem to be going places under Neil Lennon.\n\nHibs are a top club with a brilliant stadium and great fans.\n\nLast week at Easter Road the attendance for the Thistle game was over 17,000 which is just outstanding.\n\nWith that kind of backing there's no doubt they can have a successful season.\n\nApart from Whitts, Lennon has signed well this summer and brought in some proper players.\n\nAnthony Stokes is a boy who seems to have his issues off the park, but on it he's got real talent.\n\nIf he can stay focused then I reckon he could be one of the signings of the season.\n\nThat's what Lennon will be thinking because he will not be interested in returning to the Premier League just to make up the numbers.\n\nLennon will fancy his chances of finishing in the top half of the table, and that's where I've already predicted they will end up.\n\nTomorrow at Ibrox it's going to be a big test for them.\n\nRangers have been decent in their recent games so I look forward to seeing how it turns out.\n\nThe atmosphere is certain to be intense given everything that happened in the 2016 Scottish Cup Final when they last played.\n\nThe scenes after that game were appalling, there's no excuse for the Hibs fans who charged on to the pitch.\n\nThey were well out of order that day, even taking into consideration they had just won the trophy they thought they were never going to win.\n\nThere will only be a few thousand Hibs fans at Ibrox , but it's sure to be a red hot occasion.

You miss the drama and the intensity and the theatre of it,\" he said. \"That's what it really is, it is theatre. It's sport, it's entertainment. There is a darker side to it sometimes but hopefully that can be kept within the confines of the game.\n\n\"I enjoy it. Yes, there can be some venomous things said, but there can also be a lot of humour. You can't take yourself too seriously there. You hear some quips from the crowd. You try to put on a straight face but sometimes you can't help but snap. You've just got to try to keep your emotions in check but you are human beings at the end of the day. It is the mock outrage you see - 'he said that!' - if you retort. They go running to the stewards.\n\n\"But I enjoy it. I enjoy getting off the bus. I enjoy walking out on to the pitch. I enjoy winning there - when you win it is a great feeling. So I want my players to go and enjoy that experience as well.\"\n\nHe is backing his men to surprise those who feel Rangers have made signings that again render them one of the major threats. He has watched Pedro Caixinha's side and believes his men are equal to anything the home side might throw at them.\n\n\"Of course we're going there with optimism,\" he added. \"Absolutely. We have a great chance. We're not just going there to make up the numbers. We want Hibs to be a force, not just this season but in years to come. It's a difficult fixture, a difficult venue to visit, but we're playing well - and we've nothing to fear.\"\n\nIn the past there have been highs, lows, controversies and caustic welcomes, as well as the odd premature departure. His last match there, as Celtic manager, in March 2012, ended with a 3-2 win for the home side, while his side edged the red card count two to one. He says that day counts as one of the craziest at the ground as he was barred from returning to the technical area after half-time.\n\n\"It was a piece of nonsense, me getting sent off - we went to Hampden and it was thrown out in five minutes. But I ended up watching the [second half of the] game in a wee room on the telly. I was sent off because the official said I was using foul and abusive language so I watched the game in the media room. Well, I couldn't go up to the stand, could I?\n\n\"There have been a few surreal things happen to me there over the years - going out on the pitch with Martin [O'Neill], being sent off after the game by Stuart Dougal; that really\n\npleased Gordon Strachan, that! I've had great occasions there. Beach Ball Sunday, that kind of thing. It's all been part of the drama. But this is different, I'm going there with Hibs.\"\n\nLennon is no longer heading there for a traditional derby but there is some needle. The fixture developed into a grudge match during the respective sides' stay in the second tier of the Scottish game and the antipathy increased after Hibs stunned the Glasgow side by defeating them in the 2016 Scottish Cup final.\n\nThat result has helped banish any trepidation, as have their performances against other Premiership sides in recent seasons, with Lennon keen to crank up the pressure on the hosts.\n\n\"What you want to do is make them nervous. Because they can get nervous in front of their own fans,\" he said. \"What you don't want - and this is a bit rich coming from me - is anyone getting over-emotional. You've got to stay cold and concentrate on the game.\n\n\"It is harder to stay calm on the touchline than when you're playing. Out on the pitch, you can put in a tackle. Sometimes you need to take a deep breath on the touchline. As you get older, you do learn to temper it, maybe mellow a bit. I know the parameters in which I'm allowed to work. I know I can't get too emotional.

He seems completely unable to control himself at Ibrox. We can only speculate as to why. His actions in the dugout yesterday - where he made various inflammatory gestures to the supporters sitting directly behind the Hibernian dugout - were not becoming of any football manager, never mind one who likes to play the victim when things do not go his way.\n\n\"It is inexplicable that the fourth official chose to take no action against him at the time but, against the backdrop of possibly the worst refereeing performance ever seen at Ibrox, perhaps we should not be surprised.\n\n\"Mr Lennon has been extensively quoted in the media as saying that he \"didn't make a gesture\". If that quote is accurate then he is not only irresponsible but a liar.\n\n\"Had a Rangers supporter reacted to Mr Lennon's actions yesterday then we would no doubt have been treated to further dramatic headlines about the persecution he has to suffer. Instead we have seen several media commentators make jokes about Lennon's conduct. It is only because of the good sense of our supporters that they are in a position to do so.\n\n\"Police Scotland categorised this match as high risk due to the behaviour of Hibernian supporters at the Scottish Cup Final in 2016 when Rangers players were attacked on the pitch.

It was a nervous time for the boys and I think the start of the game showed that. You could see it.\n\n\"It was the first Premiership game in years and just as big as today. To get off to a wining start against a good Partick side was massive.\"\n\nThe fall-out from that day at Hampden when thousands of Hibs fans invaded the pitch on the final whistle and some of the unsavoury scenes which developed between both sets of supporters and resulted in dozens of arrests will undoubtedly be an undercurrent this afternoon.\n\nSwanson, though, insisted it will have no bearing on events at Ibrox while admitting that, like every Hibs fan, he has fond memories even if he was on holiday, revealing the national stadium hadn't been kind to him as a supporter down the years. He said: \"It was a special day, a massive day for the club and me personally. It was great for my friends like Darren [McGregor] to be part of that day. It was pretty emotional, if I'm honest, but it's where you go from there. We have to put it on the back-burner.\n\n\"This is a new season, two different teams - they are very different - and the Scottish Cup final is not something we are thinking about. It's just another league game for us.\"\n\nSwanson agreed, however, that an even greater rivalry probably now exists between the clubs' supporters, saying: \"I think that's a good thing for Scottish football. It's two massive clubs battling against each other. But, as players, it's a different mindset.\n\n\"The manager gives you a game-plan and you need to go and execute it. Both teams are confident and it should make for a good game.\"\n\nLennon has already stressed to his players the need not to get caught up in the hype surrounding the match and, while admitting his manager was \"maybe a bit different as a player\", Swanson added: \"He is quite good at keeping us cool.\n\n\"He keeps us grounded and that's something he always emphasises, to keep cool and not be over-emotional. That's a big part of the game, don't get too involved and focus on our football. Obviously, we will need to battle and defend at times and see it out without the ball at times, but we have a lot of big-game players in our team.\n\n\"There will be times when we need to defend, but we have a real threat on the counter if we are sitting in. We have real pace and quality and with someone like [Anthony] Stokes coming in, he has done it before and can hopefully do it again.\"\n\nThe small pocket of Hibs fans tucked away in the far corner of Ibrox will be outnumbered many times over by the home support but, insisted Swanson, that can be used to the Capital club's advantage.\n\nRecalling previous trips to the ground as a St Johnstone player, he said: \"Tommy Wright used to say to us 'get the fans on their back'. That's what you need to do at times, slow the game down. Their fans are very demanding, they need to win every game regardless of their squad.\n\n\"This isn't the best Rangers squad they've ever had but they still have some very good players like Kenny Miller and Lee Wallace. They will feel pressure if things aren't going well, the fans could get on their backs.\"\n\nAs a boyhood Hibs fan, Swanson used to enjoy watching Miller play in a green-and-white jersey and, he admitted, he marvels at the veteran striker's longevity. He said: \"I used to sit in the East Stand watching him when he was a young boy. It's incredible how he is still performing at that level - he's still the top man. Everything they do, it goes through him, he's a top professional.\n\n\"His quality is there and it's like he's changed his game from when he was a younger player. It's a bit like what Ronaldo has done at Real Madrid, he doesn't have the pace he used to have but he has a brain that's ahead of a lot of others.\"\n\nLennon is already on record as saying he wants to see his side compete to be \"best of the rest\" behind Celtic and Swanson believes a top four-finish at least is well within Hibs' capabilities. He said: \"This squad is the best I've ever been involved with in my career, even in the Championship in England. We need to aim as high as we can.\"", "timeCrawl": "05:45:00", "sim": 0.6627451181411743, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-12", "id": "8748756", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "id": 138, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

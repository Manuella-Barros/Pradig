The \u2018Caina Healey Children\u2019s Try-a-Tri\u2019 will take place on Friday (June 14) and will see over 60 primary school children from across the city take part in a 50-metre swim, two-mile cycle and one-mile run event. Maureen Healy, Caina\u2019s sister said: \u201cWe as a family will be forever proud of all Caina\u2019s achievements, both personal and professional. We are totally humbled by the Bogside & Brandywell Health Forum, who have given a lot of time and effort to ensure Caina's legacy lives on in something she was so dedicated to - triathlon and children in sport.\" Maureen added: \"Her love for this sport started in her hometown Derry. We wish all participants the greatest of luck and know they will show all the attributes we so fondly remember about Caina. Our memory of her will always be of love.\u201d Health programmes manager at the Health Forum, Aisling Hutton, said that the event has been designed to encourage more young children to improve their fitness & mental health; set health goals; and support each other to live healthier lives. \u201cWe are incredibly proud to host this Try-a-Tri in Caina\u2019s name,\u201d Aisling said. \u201cOver the past couple of months, we were lucky to met with Caina\u2019s family and we were in awe hearing about the life Caina lived. She truly was an inspiration through her dedication to sport and her encouragement of young people to get more active.\u201d Aisling, who also sits on Derry City and Strabane Council for Sinn Fein, said she hopes that the Caina Healey Children\u2019s Try-a-Tri will be the first of many over the coming years. \u201cWe host an annual Try-a-Tri event for adults every year that is always a great success,\" she said. \"Many people who complete it, push on to train for full triathlons and other races and generally make lasting, positive changes to their fitness and health. It would be great to see this replicated for the kids. With the challenges children face, we believe the Caina Healey Children\u2019s Try-a-Tri, can be the perfect \u2018kick-start\u2019to a healthier lifestyle.\u201d In addition to hosting the Children\u2019s try-a-tri, the Health Forum have been visiting participating schools in the run-up, to oversee training for the event and to hold workshops discussing Caina, her values, and the inspiring life she lived. The \u2018Caina Healey Children\u2019s Try-a-Tri\u2019 will also serve as a fundraiser for the Health Forum\u2019s \u2018Danny Quigley Fund\u2019 (DQF). The fund was established following the achievements of local triathlete Danny Quigley who completed 10 triathlons in 10 days in 2021 and last year swam over 120 kilometres in memory of those who have died by suicide in the North West. The fund facilitates one-to-one mental health counselling services in the community.

The Monaco grid was stacked with famous faces - perfect for an infamous grid walk. And there were plenty of footballers in attendance now that the domestic season is over. He first spoke to Diogo Dalot who spoke of his pride after winning the FA Cup with Manchester United a day earlier. And then he turned his attention to France megastar Mbappe who was just making his way onto the grid with his entourage. But he encountered some resistance at first. After approaching the footballer, a bodyguard positioned himself between Mbappe and Brundle, prompting a sarcastic response from the Sky Sports F1 favourite. \"It's alright mate, I'm in charge around here,\" he quipped after first being told he could not speak to Mbappe. And, sure enough, he continued to shout the Frenchman's name until he caught his attention. After a small nod from the bodyguard, Mbappe leaned in to answer one question from Brundle. The Sky reporter jokingly suggested the footballer might be fast enough to compete against the F1 cars on the grid, which brought a smile and a response from Mbappe. He said: \"No no, I'm not faster than the cars! I just want to be here as a fan and to enjoy the moment.\" And as the group walked off, Brundle couldn't resist another little dig as he said: \"Thanks for talking to us, and to your dear friend there.\" --- There will be more to follow on this breaking news story and Mirror Sport will bring you the very latest updates, pictures and video as soon as possible.

Bilawal claimed that 2018 general elections will be his first and Kaptaan's last.\n\nHe said in the skipper's view everybody except him was involved in corruption. He said Khan boasted about KP Ehtesab Commission which arrested a sitting minister. \"What happened to that poor minister's allegations of corruption against KP chief minister?\" he asked.\n\n\"When investigation would be held into Khyber Bank scandal and mines contracts? I am not levelling allegations against Khan Sahib, these are the allegations levelled by PTI MNAs and MPAs.\"\n\nBilawal said Imran Khan was taking credit for reducing terrorism. \"Did you ever speak against terrorists? It was you who called for talks with the Taliban, and it was you who gave funds to a madressa. It was you who opposed operation against terrorists.\"\n\nLater on, Bilawal slammed Nawaz Sharif, saying, \"The word 'revolution' doesn't suit you. You can be fascist and conspirator but not revolutionary.\"\n\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari said \"Mian Sahib could be a conspirator, a saboteur but not a revolutionary. You are guilty, you are not innocent . . .\"\n\nHe criticised Nawaz for only appearing in parliament when he got into trouble, highlighting his rare visits to National Assembly and Senate, and damaging the public institutions.\n\nHe accused the former premier of corrupt practices and damaging the economy with weak policies. He also recalled that Nawaz Sharif took money from Osama Bin Laden and intelligence agencies to derail the government of Benazir Bhutto in past.\n\nHe said Nawaz placed the country under foreign debt and made fake claims about development.\n\nHe opined that both the leaders don't have any solution to the nationwide problems while PPP's manifesto is for the poor, farmers, labourers, traders and people friendly.\n\n\"We will all join hands to make this country prosper,\" he hoped.\n\nSeparately, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Khurshid Shah said the PPP will make the country Bhutto's Pakistan.\n\nAddressing a public gather in Mansehra on Saturday, he said that politics of Nawaz Sharif had been brought up under the dictator Ziaul Haq and he laid foundation of politics of lies.\n\nHe said that farmers, labourers and poor people of the country were deprived of basic rights due to self directed policies of ruling PML-N.

It was you who called for talks with the Taliban, and it was you who gave funds to a madressa. It was you who opposed operation against terrorists.\n\nLater on, Bilawal slammed his other political opponent and ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif saying the word 'revolution' doesn't suit you. \"You can be fascist and conspirator but not revolutionary,\" he added.\n\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari said \"Mian Sahib could be a conspirator, a sabotager but not a revolutionary\". \"You are guilty, you are not innocent . . .\"\n\nThe PPP chief criticised Nawaz Sharif for only appearing in parliament when he got into trouble, highlighting his rare visits to National Assembly and Senate, and damaging the public institutions.\n\nHe accused the former premier of corrupt practices and damaging the economy with weak policies. He also recalled that Nawaz Sharif took money from Osama Bin Laden and intelligence agencies to derail the government of Benazir Bhutto in past.\n\nHe said Nawaz Sharif placed the country under foreign debt and made fake claims about development.\n\nHe opined that both the leaders don't have any solution to the nationwide problems while PPP's manifesto is for the poor, farmers, labourers, traders and people friendly. \"We will all join hands to make this country prosper,\" he hoped.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T18:46:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.7098039388656616, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3374375", "time": "18:46:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3374375", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "M\u0101nsehra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "48371", "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pakhtunkhwa", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "48442", "label": {"eng": "M\u0101nsehra"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansehra", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "M\u0101nsehra"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "48724", "label": {"eng": "Federally Administered Tribal Areas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_Administered_Tribal_Areas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Federally Administered Tribal Areas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic of Pakistan"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "303057", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "score": 4}, {"id": "303355", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Taliban"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliban", "score": 2}, {"id": "306057", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Osama bin Laden"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden", "score": 1}, {"id": "307776", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "score": 3}, {"id": "310969", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Privatization"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatization", "score": 3}, {"id": "314051", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Peoples Party"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Peoples_Party", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 4}, {"id": "325537", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Imran Khan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imran_Khan", "score": 5}, {"id": "335568", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_Tehreek-e-Insaf", "score": 5}, {"id": "355143", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Assembly of Pakistan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_of_Pakistan", "score": 2}, {"id": "355513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Madrasa"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasa", "score": 2}, {"id": "394089", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bilawal Bhutto Zardari"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilawal_Bhutto_Zardari", "score": 4}, {"id": "394093", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Benazir Bhutto"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benazir_Bhutto", "score": 1}, {"id": "401344", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Order of St. Patrick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St._Patrick", "score": 5}], "image": "http://thefrontierpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pic19-079.jpg", "timeCrawl": "18:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Bilawal claims 2018 elections will be his first and Imran Khan's last - The Frontier Post", "originalArticle": null}

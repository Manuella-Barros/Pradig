{"id": 231967952, "title": "Douglas Ross must answer \u2018serious\u2019 questions over travel expenses, says Swinney", "text": "Douglas Ross has \u201cserious\u201d questions to answer on whether he used Westminster expenses to travel for his job as a football linesman, John Swinney has said. Reports in the Sunday Mail claimed the Scottish Conservative leader\u2019s advisers flagged concerns over 28 parliamentary travel claims which may have been combined with his work as a linesman. Mr Swinney described the claims as \u201cvery significant\u201d and demanded Mr Ross explains the expenses in detail. Under UK parliamentary rules, MPs can only claim travel from their home airport \u2013 which was either Inverness or Aberdeen in Mr Ross\u2019s case when he was MP for Moray. They can also claim for \u201cdiverted\u201d journeys, but must supply detailed notes on the diversion. The newspaper states Mr Ross\u2019s aides raised alarm in November 2021 over expense claims which included a \u00a358 parking fee at Inverness Airport in July 2018 while Parliament was in recess. It also stated \u00a343 rail travel from Heathrow to central London was claimed the day after Mr Ross was a linesman in a match in Iceland. Claims also include that he expensed a flight from London to Glasgow and \u00a3109 parking. On November 1, 2020 it is alleged he claimed \u00a348.99 for parking the day he refereed a Celtic game. Mr Ross told the paper it was \u201cnot possible\u201d to go from London to a football game as he would not have had his referee kit with him. He said: \u201cI have only ever claimed expenses related to my role as a member of Parliament and the costs of getting me to and from Westminster. \u201cThese have all been agreed by IPSA, the independent body that oversees MPs\u2019 expenses, but I would have no issue with them being scrutinised again.\u201d While Mr Swinney said he did not want to \u201cjump to conclusions\u201d, he told journalists in Paisley on Sunday: \u201cThe report in the Sunday Mail this morning about Douglas Ross allegedly using public funds to support his career as a football linesman raises very significant issues and I think Douglas Ross has got to set out all of the information about this particular issue. \u201cI\u2019m not going to jump to conclusions about people. I don\u2019t know the details about this, but (this) raises very, very significant concerns. \u201cDouglas Ross is normally the first to be out of the stables demanding that everybody sets out all of the information, so I think Mr Ross should do that right away because the story raises very significant and serious issues of the potential misuse of public funds.\u201d It comes after Mr Ross confirmed he is standing as a candidate in Aberdeenshire North and Moray East in the General Election, after previously ruling it out to focus on his Holyrood responsibilities. He has come under fire for his handling of the issue after David Duguid was blocked from standing as the Scottish Tory candidate in the seat. Mr Duguid was taken to hospital in April, with party management taking the decision that he is \u201cunable to stand\u201d due to ill health \u2013 which Mr Duguid has said is \u201csimply incorrect\u201d.", "summary": "The Scottish Tory leader is facing questions over whether his expenses related to his work as a football referee.", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/douglas-ross-must-answer-serious-questions-over-travel-expenses-warns-swinney-4658701", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmQ0OWI3ZGU0LTE4MWQtNGRkOS05ZGMzLTI4M2Q4NzU1YWYzNDpiYTQ0YjFlZS1hZmU5LTQyNjAtOTRkOC02YjUwNjQwMTU5NmE=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:56:24", "author": "Alexander Brown", "authors": ["Alexander Brown"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.158}

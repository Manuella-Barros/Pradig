The position, the announcement stated, would serve two clients, HTC Global an information technology company based in Troy, Michigan, and Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational holding company based in Omaha, Nebraska.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice also cited a separate case alleging another incident of discriminatory practices by Arthur Grand Technologies.\n\n\"In May 2023, the Civil Rights Division's Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) opened an investigation and determined that Arthur Grand discriminated based on citizenship status and national origin after a recruiter working for Arthur Grand's subsidiary in India posted the advertisement on the job website Indeed,\" the DOJ said. \"The advertisement was widely circulated on social media and generated several news articles. Arthur Grand's actions harmed individuals with permission to work in the U.S., including U.S. citizens born outside the United States and certain non-U.S. citizens, by unlawfully deterring them from applying to the job advertisement.\"\n\nAs part of the Justice Department settlement with Arthur Grand Technologies, the IT company has been ordered to pay a civil penalty to the United States, and the agreement also requires Arthur Grand to train its personnel on the INA's (Immigration and Nationality Act) requirements, revise its employment policies and will be subject to departmental monitoring going forward, officials said.\n\nIn the conciliation agreement with the Labor Department, Arthur Grand will also pay compensation to individuals who filed complaints with its Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) and the company \"has committed to providing workplace specific training for all company employees involved in recruiting, selecting candidates or tracking expressions of interest for open positions,\" the DOJ said.\n\n\"The Labor Department's agreement resolves its determination that Arthur Grand violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits federal contractors from discriminating in employment based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin,\" the DOJ said.\n\n\"It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using 'whites only' and 'only US born' job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color. I share the public's outrage at Arthur Grand's appalling and discriminatory ban on job candidates based on citizenship status, national origin, color and race,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \"The Justice Department, working with other government agencies, will continue to hold employers accountable when they violate our nation's federal civil rights laws.\"\n\nSaid Acting Director Michele Hodge of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs: \"Over the past 58 years, OFCCP has protected workers and job seekers from workplace discrimination. We are committed to holding federal contractors accountable for outrageous discriminatory practices like this advertisement.

(Madalina Vasiliu/The Epoch Times)\n\nA Virginia technology company has agreed to pay thousands of dollars in penalties for posting a \"whites only\" job ad last year, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\nThe DOJ said in a release on Monday that it and the Department of Labor had reached agreements with Arthur Grand Technologies Inc. to resolve allegations of discriminatory job postings.\n\nArthur Grand will pay the U.S. Treasury a civil penalty of $7,500 and compensation to the complainants of $31,000 after an investigation found that a 2023 job ad violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to the terms of separate settlements.\n\nThe ad was posted on the job-seeking site Indeed, advertising for a business analyst position with the company's sales and insurance claims team in Dallas.\n\nThe listing included in bolded text: \"Only Born U.S. Citizens [White] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, Texas [Don't share with candidates].\"\n\nThe Labor Department determined that this action violated Executive Order 11246, which prohibits discrimination by federal contractors. Specifically, Arthur Grand was found to have discriminated against job seekers based on their race and national origin during the recruitment process for a salesforce business analyst position.\n\nThe investigation revealed that a job ad posted by a recruiter in India unlawfully deterred certain individuals from applying. The findings were issued in January but released publicly in May. Arthur Grand agreed to take several corrective actions to avoid legal proceedings as part of a conciliation agreement.\n\n\"It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using 'whites only' and 'only U.S. born' job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color,\" DOJ Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said in a statement.\n\nMs. Clarke added that the department would continue to \"hold employers accountable when they violate our nation's federal civil rights laws.\"\n\nLast year, the company said in a since-deleted LinkedIn statement that the posting was not authorized by Arthur Grand or its employees.\n\n\"A former employee took an existing posting and added discriminatory language, then reposted it through his own account,\" the company stated. \"The moment this was brought to our attention, we worked with the job portal to remove this offensive job posting. Necessary legal action has been initiated against the job poster.\"\n\nArthur Grand described itself in the statement as a \"minority-owned\" company that \"prides itself\" on the diversity of its staff and leadership.\n\nThe Epoch Times has contacted Arthur Grand for comment.\n\nAs part of the settlements, those eligible will receive a minimum payment of $1,000 each. The company has neither admitted nor denied the violations but has agreed to the terms to avoid further litigation.\n\nAdditionally, the company is required to train staff on legal requirements, revise employment policies, and undergo monitoring by the respective departments. It has also committed to providing specific workplace training for employees involved in recruitment processes to prevent future discrimination, according to the news release.\n\nA similar controversy swirled around a job posting by the Kraft Group, which owns the New England Patriots, for advertising a sports management job that required applicants to be \"BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and Person of Color).\"\n\nThe job ad, which went viral in March, was highlighted as discriminating against white candidates.\n\nConcerns around hiring discrimination prompted Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.) and Pat Fallon (R-Texas) of the House Oversight Committee to open a probe into the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's enforcement of federal law prohibiting racial discrimination in employment practices. This came following concerns that some companies may be discriminating against candidates.\n\nThe inquiry was announced after 13 attorneys general sent a letter to Fortune 100 companies expressing concern about their diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The letter highlighted what they said were unlawful racial discrimination in hiring policies. It cited specific instances and companies allegedly engaging in racial quotas and preferences.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits unlawful employment practices that discriminate based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Outrage quickly followed when the job posting was shared on social media.\n\nThe Justice Department's Civil Rights Division began investigating Arthur Grand Technologies in May that year.

It also denied that it discriminated against applicants and said it prided itself on its diversity, WFAA reported. The job listing was taken down.\n\nThe Justice Department found in an investigation that a recruiter working for Arthur Grand's subsidiary in India posted the job advertisement, according to the news release.\n\nArthur Grand signed a settlement agreement with the Justice Department and the U.S. Labor Department resolving that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act and an executive order that forbids federal contractors from discriminating in employment based on race or nationality.\n\nBesides the monetary penalties, Arthur Grand will also provide workplace training on federal

In addition to a $7,500 civil penalty, Arthur Grand will pay $31,000 to the 31 individuals who filed complaints about the discriminatory job posting.\n\nThe company, a minority-owned federal contractor, will also undergo monitoring to ensure adherence to anti-discrimination laws. The Justice Department reported that the March 2023 job posting contained discriminatory language, restricting eligible candidates to U.S. citizens born in the country and residing within 60 miles of Dallas, Texas.\n\nThis information, marked \"Don't share with candidates\", was intended to be hidden from applicants. \"It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using 'whites only' and 'only US-born' job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of colour,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said in the statement.\n\nClarke echoed public outrage in the statement, condemning Arthur Grand's \"appalling and discriminatory ban on job candidates based on citizenship status, national origin, colour and race.\"\n\nWhile the Justice Department's Immigrant and Employee Rights Section investigated the case, Arthur Grand reached a separate agreement with the Labor Department.\n\nDOJ and DOL Take Action Against Arthur Grand's Discriminatory Ad\n\nDespite stating they \"neither admit nor deny any violation\" in their agreement with the Department of Labor, Arthur Grand CEO Sheik Rahmathullah maintained his company's innocence in a message to NPR. He claimed the discriminatory job posting was the work of a single unauthorised employee.\n\nOn the other hand, the federal agencies found that the job posting discriminated against applicants based on their national origin and potential citizenship status. Here's what they saw.\n\nDiscrimination: The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Labor (DOL) agreed that the March 2023 job posting by Arthur Grand was discriminatory.\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act Violation: The DOJ specifically cited a violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act. This likely refers to the act's provisions prohibiting discrimination based on national origin in employment.\n\nExecutive Order Violation: The DOL pointed to a violation of an executive order barring discrimination by federal contractors. This order likely prohibits discrimination based on race, national origin, and other protected characteristics (which may include citizenship status depending on the specific order).\n\nThe Department of Labor's agreement with Arthur Grand revealed additional violations beyond the discriminatory job posting. The company failed to track applicant demographics like race, ethnicity, and gender and neglected to correctly display a notice informing workers of their equal employment opportunity rights.\n\nJob Seekers Struggle in a Changing Workforce\n\n\"We are committed to holding federal contractors accountable for outrageous discriminatory practices like this advertisement,\" said Acting Director Michele Hodge of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). \"Companies like Arthur Grand, that accept federal contracts cannot have a 'whites only' hiring process.\"\n\nThe Labor Department's agreement requires Arthur Grand to send a specific letter to individuals complaining about the discriminatory job posting. The caveat is that to participate in the settlement, applicants must sign a waiver acknowledging that Arthur Grand denies any wrongdoing in their application process.\n\nThe discriminatory job posting adds insult to injury for job seekers already facing an uncertain future. Computer scientist Geoffrey Hinton recently pointed out that automation will likely displace many workers in routine positions.\n\nCompounding this challenge, The World Economic Forum's 2023 Future of Jobs Report predicts that over 75 per cent of companies will adopt A.I. and automation within five years. This rapid technological shift is poised to transform the way we work dramatically.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times UK"}, "authors":

The agreement also requires Arthur Grand to train its personnel on the INA's requirements, revise its employment policies and be subject to departmental monitoring.\n\nUnder the Labor Department conciliation agreement, Arthur Grand will pay compensation to individuals who filed complaints with its Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). In addition, Arthur Grand has committed to providing workplace specific training for all company employees involved in recruiting, selecting candidates or tracking expressions of interest for open positions.\n\nSadly, this type of racist corporate behavior is far from an isolated incident.\n\nIn February, a healthcare company in Georgia posted a job listing that stated matter of factly that there were \"No African Americans needed\" for the position.\n\nThe listing was posted to the popular jobs website Indeed, according to a screenshot that was shared on social media at the time.\n\nFirst Coast News reported that the ad posted by AmeriPro EMS was ultimately removed by Indeed.\n\nSimilar to Arthur Grand Technologies Inc., AmeriPro EMS blamed the \"malicious post\" on an unspecified person with \"unauthorized access to a third-party site.\"\n\nThis is America.\n\nKyle Rittenhouse Tells Native Americans They Can 'Leave' If They Hate America\n\nClarence Thomas Suggests Supreme Court's Brown v.

Each of the 31 complainants received $1000 in exchange for agreeing not to sue.\n\nThe open position was for a \"business analyst\" for \"Salesforce and and insurance claims,\" a job description I hope no one ever tries to explain to me. The ad read: \"Only Born US Citizens [White] who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX [Don't share with candidates].\" Clearly, the person who listed the claim was not paying attention to that last part. (Unless they were and they wanted the company to get caught.)\n\nThe listing, which was posted to Indeed by a recruiter in India, explained that whoever was hired \"would serve two clients, HTC Global, an information technology company based in Troy, Michigan, and Berkshire Hathaway, the multinational holding company based in Omaha, Nebraska.\"\n\nThe DOJ found, following an investigation, that Arthur Grand had violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, which bars employers from discriminating based on one's ethnicity or immigration status (for those legally allowed to work in the country), while the Department of Labor said that the company violated a statute barring federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of race or ethnicity.\n\n\"It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using 'whites only' and 'only US born' job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color. I share the public's outrage at Arthur Grand's appalling and discriminatory ban on job candidates based on citizenship status, national origin, color and race,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in an official statement. \"The Justice Department, working with other government agencies, will continue to hold employers accountable when they violate our nation's federal civil rights laws.\"\n\n\"Over the past 58 years, OFCCP has protected workers and job seekers from workplace discrimination. We are committed to holding federal contractors accountable for outrageous discriminatory practices like this advertisement,\" said acting director Michele Hodge of the Department of Labor's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP). \"Companies like Arthur Grand that accept federal contracts cannot have a 'whites only' hiring process.\"\n\nReally, no company should have a \"whites only\" hiring practice -- although it's worth noting that federally and in many states without their own laws, companies with 15 or fewer employees are allowed to discriminate.\n\nCEO Sheik Rahmathullah said his company \"vehemently denies any guilt or wrongdoing,\" and blamed the posting on a \"rogue staffer.\" He also notes that 80 percent of the company's staff are people of color, as are all of those who occupy senior leadership positions.\n\nDonate Just Once!\n\nOne has to wonder, given this, if it wasn't one or both of the companies themselves that put this out in the first place. It's hard to imagine that a recruiter, someone whose job it is to find candidates to fill positions, would come up with this on their own for this and only this posting.", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- A northern Virginia tech company is paying $38,500 to settle claims that it discriminated by posting a job listing seeking white, U.S.-born candidates for an opening as a business analyst.\n\nThe Justice Department announced Thursday that it had reached a settlement agreement with Arthur Grand Technologies, an information technology firm in Ashburn, Virginia.\n\nThe company listed the business analyst job online in March 2023, specifically seeking \"Only Born US Citizens (White) who are local within 60 miles from Dallas, TX (Don't share with candidates).\"\n\n\"It is shameful that in the 21st century, we continue to see employers using 'whites only' and 'only US born' job postings to lock out otherwise eligible job candidates of color\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's civil rights division in a statement. \"I share the public's outrage at Arthur Grand's appalling and discriminatory ban on job candidates based on citizenship status, national origin, color and race.\"\n\nIn the settlement agreement, the company said the ad was \"generated by a disgruntled recruiter in India and was intended to embarrass the company,\" and that it never intended to dissuade non-citizens from applying.\n\nArthur Grand did not return a call and email Tuesday seeking comment.\n\nThe settlement includes a $7,500 penalty to settle a Justice Department investigation and $31,000 as part of a settlement with the Labor Department to compensate individuals who filed complaints alleging they were discriminated against by the advertisement.\n\nThe agreement also requires Arthur Grand to train its personnel on the requirements of the federal hiring and discrimination laws and revise its employment policies.\n\nIn 2019, another northern Virginia tech firm, Cynet Systems, apologized after posting an online ad seeking \"preferably Caucasian\" applicants for an account manager job in Florida.", "source": {"uri":

The separate agreement document from the DOL indicated that AGT would also pay $31,000 to the complainants. Both federal agencies ordered the AGT to declare and abide by an equal opportunity policy in every one of its job advertisements, according to the documents. They also ordered AGT to avoid intimidating or threatening participants in and beneficiaries of the investigation, among other agreed-upon demands.

AGT asserted that the recruiter was \"disgruntled\" and that the advertisement \"was intended to embarrass the company,\" according to the DOJ's agreement document. AGT denied authorizing the posting and neither admitted nor denied violating an executive order, according to both agreements.\n\nThe advertised position was intended to serve two of AGT's clients -- Michigan-based HTC Global and Nebraska-based Berkshire Hathaway, the DOJ said.\n\nAGT has subsidiaries in Canada and India, according to its website.\n\nDOJ Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke said the job posting was \"shameful\" and that she \"share[d] the public's outrage at Arthur Grand's appalling and discriminatory ban on job candidates based on citizenship status, national origin, color and race.\"\n\nThe DOJ will \"continue to hold employers accountable,\" she added.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Labor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Labor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashburn,_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ashburn, Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ashburn, Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_11246", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Executive Order 11246"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_opportunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equal opportunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Clarke", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristen Clarke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Assistant_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Assistant Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Employment", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1827538981-scaled-e1713904827235.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9603547", "eventUri": "eng-9603547", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-23", "textStart": 514, "textEnd": 520}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

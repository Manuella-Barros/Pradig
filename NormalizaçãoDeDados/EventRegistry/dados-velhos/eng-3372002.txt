The copy of the letter seen by Reuters was undated, but Thomas Heberer, of the University Duisburg-Essen in Germany, who is a board member, said it was sent out on Thursday.\n\nCambridge University Press said in a statement it was\"troubled by the recent increase in requests of this nature\" and planned to raise the issue with \"relevant agencies\" at the Beijing Book Fair next week.\n\n\"We are aware that other publishers have had entire collections of content blocked in China until they have enabled the import agencies to block access to individual articles,\" it said.\n\n\"We do not, and will not, proactively censor our content and will only consider blocking individual items (when requested to do so) when the wider availability of content is at risk.\"\n\nACADEMIC FREEDOM\n\nThe publishing business of the elite Cambridge University, CUP is the world's oldest publishing house, according to its website, tracing its history to the 16th century.\n\nThe list of articles the government requested be removed covered an array of topics, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the Cultural Revolution, Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan, Pringle's letter said.\n\nHeberer and another of the journal's board members, who declined to be identified, said they had not been told which articles and book reviews were on the list.\n\nThe letter said inquiries by China Quarterly suggested that it was \"the only major China studies journal to be subject to these measures but it is likely other journals will be affected in the near future\".\n\nCalls to China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, which oversees GAPP, were not answered and there was no immediate response to faxed questions.\n\nQiao Mu, a media researcher and former professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said he was not surprised and noted that censorship was the norm.\n\n\"In the old days restrictions were usually looser for academia, but now it is also tightening up,\" he said. \"Social science study in China has stalled for many years, it is all results of censorship and information control.\"\n\nRestrictions on what academics and students can say are nothing new in China.

In an email to members of the CQ editorial board, posted on Twitter on Thursday, Pringle said that CUP had pulled articles from its Chinese website after being sent a list by the General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP), a state press censor.\n\nIn the email, Pringle says CUP took down around 300 pieces in order to avoid having their entire website shut down. Pringle said CUP claimed the same demands have been issued to other publishers, though in the email he says that he has contacted other editors of journals relating to Chinese studies, and none were aware of similar demands being made of their publishers.\n\nA screenshot of the email was posted on Twitter by Jonathan Henshaw, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia.\n\nThe pieces mostly relate to topics such as Tiananmen Square, the Cultural Revolution, Tibet, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. The material ranges from pieces published in the last few months to that written in the 1960s. China is well-known for its censorship of the both press and many Western websites, including Facebook. The watchdog charity Reporters Without Borders gave China the lowest possible score on its press freedom ranking.\n\nPringle said that both China Quarterly and CUP would \"issue a statement and develop a more detailed response and policy approach\".\n\nIn a statement to Varsity, CUP said that \"Freedom of thought and expression underpin what we as publishers believe in, yet Cambridge University Press and all international publishers face the challenge of censorship.\n\n\"We can confirm that we received an instruction from a Chinese import agency to block individual articles from China Quarterly within China. We complied with this initial request to remove individual articles, to ensure that other academic and educational materials we publish remain available to researchers and educators in this market.\n\n\"We are aware that other publishers have had entire collections of content blocked in China until they have enabled the import agencies to block access to individual articles. We do not, and will not, proactively censor our content and will only consider blocking individual items (when requested to do so) when the wider availability of content is at risk.\n\nCUP also said that it is committed to expanding freedom to publish in china, and said it \"will continue to take every opportunity to influence this agenda\".\n\nThis is not the first time that CUP has been involved in controversy with its international affairs.

The news came to light after an undated screenshot of an email to CQ's editorial board from the journal's editor, Tim Pringle, went viral on social media today (Aug. 18).\n\nAccording to Pringle, CUP complied with the request so as to prevent the shutdown of the entire CUP site. Most of the articles in question relate to topics deemed sensitive to the Chinese Communist Party, such as the Cultural Revolution, Tiananmen Square, Tibet, Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and date back to the 1960s, wrote Pringle, adding that CUP had received a similar request to take down more than a thousand e-books a few months earlier.\n\nYang Guobin, a sociology professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is also a CQ editorial board member, wrote on social networking site Weibo (link in Chinese) yesterday (Aug. 17) after he received Pringle's email: \"This is one of the most important international publications in contemporary Chinese studies, yet it's subject to such restrictions... This is unheard of. Isn't the Chinese government trying to promote contemporary Chinese studies?\"\n\nJames Leibold, an associate professor at Australia's La Trobe University whose research focuses on Xinjiang, called CUP's decision \"shameful\" in a tweet.\n\nNeither Pringle nor CUP's office in Cambridge responded immediately to requests for comment from Quartz. The School of Oriental and African Studies in London, where CQ is based, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. China's GAPP couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nA Chinese academic based in Hong Kong, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions from speaking publicly, said the academic community was \"totally shocked\" by Pringle's comments, and noted that there is a broad deterioration in academic freedom in China. What is more worrying, the academic added, is that the long arm of Beijing's censorship apparatus is clearly extending beyond its own borders, citing the recent case of the detention of Feng Chongyi in China, a professor working at the University of Technology Sydney.\n\nRead full story", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences", "wgt": 100, "id": 157, "label":

It would not proactively censor content, it said.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has tightened China's already strict censorship since coming to power in 2012, as he seeks to cement the Communist Party's grip on power.\n\nForeign news is regularly censored or blocked in China, but it is unusual for academic journals, which have relatively limited readership, to face such scrutiny.\n\nChina Quarterly editor Tim Pringle wrote in a letter sent to the journal's academic board that China's General Administration of Press and Publication (GAPP) had sent Cambridge University Press (CUP), via its importer, a list of more than 300 China Quarterly articles \"to be pulled\" from its website in China.\n\nPringle, an academic at London University's School of Oriental and African Studies, did not reply to an emailed request for comment.\n\nBut the China Quarterly's editorial manager, Rowan Pease, confirmed authenticity of the letter, which was circulated online, when reached by telephone.\n\nThe letter said a similar request was made of CUP a few months ago regarding \"over a thousand\" e-books.\n\nNeither CUP nor the China Quarterly letter said when the articles were blocked. The copy of the letter seen by Reuters was undated, but Thomas Heberer, of the University Duisburg-Essen in Germany, who is a board member, said it was sent out on Thursday.\n\nCambridge University Press said in a statement it was \"troubled by the recent increase in requests of this nature\" and planned to raise the issue with \"relevant agencies\" at the Beijing Book Fair next week.\n\n\"We are aware that other publishers have had entire collections of content blocked in China until they have enabled the import agencies to block access to individual articles,\" it said. \"We do not, and will not, proactively censor our content and will only consider blocking individual items (when requested to do so) when the wider availability of content is at risk.\"\n\nACADEMIC FREEDOM\n\nThe publishing business of the elite Cambridge University, CUP is the world's oldest publishing house, according to its website, tracing its history to the 16th century.\n\nThe list of articles the government requested be removed covered an array of topics, including the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests, the Cultural Revolution, Tibet, Xinjiang and Taiwan, Pringle's letter said.\n\nHeberer and another of the journal's board members, who declined to be identified, said they had not been told which articles and book reviews were on the list.\n\nThe letter said inquiries by China Quarterly suggested that it was \"the only major China studies journal to be subject to these measures but it is likely other journals will be affected in the near future\".\n\nCalls to China's State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television, which oversees GAPP, were not answered and there was no immediate response to faxed questions.\n\nQiao Mu, a media researcher and former professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University, said he was not surprised and noted that censorship was the norm.\n\n\"In the old days restrictions were usually looser for academia, but now it is also tightening up,\" he said. \"Social science study in China has stalled for many years, it is all results of censorship and information control.\"\n\nRestrictions on what academics and students can say are nothing new in China. Curriculums and speeches at universities are tightly controlled by the government, fearful of a repeat of the pro-democracy protests in 1989 that were led by students.\n\nMany foreign universities have nonetheless rushed to establish partnerships with China in an effort to tap the country's growing demand for Western-style education. Critics fear they may be compromising academic freedoms to gain access to the China market.\n\nVictor Shih, an associate professor of political economy at the University of California San Diego, who has had two articles published in the China Quarterly, said he expected more censorship to come.\n\n\"I think it's the first move among many that are still to come as China tries to completely censor all kinds of media content,\" he said. \"But I think moves like this shoot themselves in the foot.\"\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency

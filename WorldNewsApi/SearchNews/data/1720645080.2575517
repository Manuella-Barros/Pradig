Local election results do not correlate to general election results. \"I believe the challenge for this Government now is to produce an effective budget for the next major issues (facing Ireland). \"To look after people as best we can in terms of housing, in terms of the elderly, we will look after them in the next budget which we are determined to do. \"We (want to) maintain the full employment that we have in this country, the successful economic model we have and that we make provision for infrastructure, both major infrastructure but also, as we learned in this local election campaign, the need to do the pavements, the routine bread and butter work.\" Mr Martin insisted an October general election was not possible given the Coalition's priorities. \"That is not possible - we have to do the Finance Act, we have to do a Social Welfare Act - I believe in ordered Government. \"I want to see the Government go its full term - a full term is mandated here. That has always been my position. If you run it to the budget, you have a timeline after the budget for the Finance Act. It has to be done properly.\" \"That (tackling Government priorities) has been my focus from day one - on some of the biggest issues that have come our way...Covid-19, the war in Ukraine, the financial crisis that arose from that - there have been significant challenges across the board. \"When we came into Government people were predicting that it would not last two years. \"I believe it has been a stabilising force in Government and making sure we do well by the people who elected us.\" Mr Martin said he was delighted with the strong performance of his party at the polls - and insisted they had defied the predictions of the pundits. \"They are only tallies at the moment but clearly Fianna Fail are doing far better than predicted,\" he said. \"Some people said that FF would be coming in a distant third but that has been completely disproved. I have been looking at opinion polls now for the past three years, independent polling, having FF at 14 or 15pc. Clearly FF will be well ahead of that, we will be over 20pc by the time all of these counts are put together. \"We put up a very robust performance and we are holding our own compared to our performance in General Election 2020. \"We are looking at a great result in Cork, so far it seems, although an awful lot will be determined by the transfers and the late counts which will go well into the early morning. \"I want to pay tribute to our outgoing councillors who worked very hard and enabled us to be so resilient. \"Also, Jack Chambers as Director of Elections. He did a tremendous job. It looks on the European (Parliament) front that we will gain at least one seat in the Midlands North-West for the first time in 15 years. \"There has been no tallying of the European figures but certainly (we are positive).\"", "summary": "<p>T\u00e1naiste Miche\u00e1l Martin hailed the strong performance of Fianna F\u00e1il in both the Local Government and European Parliament elections - but emphatically ruled out any question of a snap general election this year.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/elections-2024/tanaiste-rules-out-snap-general-election-this-year-these-results-dont-change-my-mind/a1084441432.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/_SAnbKA1SlBHnE5ZSSGdAWTl-oQ=/72x0:3237x2110/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/ebfa92f1-6ead-4258-8e1e-076c48607294/b468e77e-2ff8-4bb4-8ca0-e5b8cf8beb69/SN%20COALITION%20BALLOTS.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:22:02", "author": "Ralph Riegel", "authors": ["Ralph Riegel"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": 0.277}

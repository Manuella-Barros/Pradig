{"id": 223712590, "title": "Sunnyvale hotel hosts creative Pride Month celebration", "text": "Seeking to highlight local artistic talent and creative diversity, Sunnyvale\u2019s TETRA Hotel last fall launched the Oasis Makers Fair, a quarterly pop-up market for Bay Area makers and small businesses to showcase and sell their goods. In celebration of Pride Month, the June 5 Oasis will shine a light on LGBTQIA-owned and -operated businesses. The 20-plus vendors include bakers, jewelers, candlemakers and clothing designers. Visitors will also be treated to performances by Bay Area drag troupe the Rice Rockettes throughout the evening. TETRA general manager Alex Lane says the admission-free makers fair, set for 5-8 p.m., offers commuters a unique alternative to sitting in rush hour traffic while giving makers a chance to connect with new customers. \u201cOne of our goals when we opened TETRA in 2022 was to create a destination where we could support and showcase the incredible talent in our community,\u201d Lane adds. \u201cWe started with a handful of vendors at our first Oasis and have watched it grow into this incredible walkaround event through our lobby and outdoor spaces.\u201d Among the LGBTQIA-owned and -operated businesses participating in the June 5 Oasis is Milpitas-based J & R Scentuals. Co-owners James and Richie Wahl started handcrafting soy candles in 2021. \u201cWe started off making candles out of enjoyment and transitioned our passion into our business,\u201d reads their website at https://www.jandrscentuals.com. \u201cOne of the principles of J & R Scentuals is to provide products that are eco-friendly to reduce our carbon footprint. We use fragrance oils that are free from any harmful chemicals and natural soy wax.\u201d The couple also donates a portion of their profits to local animal shelters and LGBTQ nonprofits. San Jose-based Bee\u2019s Little Shop is another eco-friendly business setting up on June 5. Owner Belem Rios learned how to make plant-based skincare products from her grandma in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. By shopping at pop-up markets, Rios says, \u201cYou can actually get something that is handmade and organic and made with love and support someone local.\u201d Locals looking for some bling can check out BeautySutra by Shikha. The Cupertino-based business owner will have her handcrafted jewelry at TETRA\u2019s event. Shikha\u2019s pieces are arguably for special events, customers note the shop\u2019s reasonable prices. TETRA Hotel is located at 400 W. Java Drive in Sunnyvale.

The truth is, every coach trusts guys they\u2019ve had success with, but Thibs is particularly aggressive about bringing in vets he\u2019s worked with in the past. A big reason for that is, Thibs isn\u2019t exactly everyone\u2019s cup of tea when it comes to his coaching style. He is as demanding as it gets as an NBA coach, particularly with his expectations on defense, and it\u2019s pretty tough for someone not wired just the right way to get dropped onto one of his teams and succeed. That\u2019s why New York has been so deliberate with the kinds of guys they\u2019ve gone out and acquired, with Josh Hart and Donte DiVincenzo as shining examples of players who quickly became \u201cThibs Guys.\u201d However, there is no one who embodies being a \u201cThibs Guy\u201d more than Taj Gibson, who has played for Thibodeau in three different places \u2014 Chicago, Minnesota, and New York. He\u2019s had brief stops in between each of those, but Thibs always comes calling when he needs some frontcourt depth. Gibson was out of the league for the first half of the 2023-24 season, but when Julius Randle got hurt in January, the Knicks found themselves with a need for a big man. On a recent episode of the Club 520 Podcast with Jeff Teague, Gibson hilariously recounted seeing Randle get hurt, noting to himself there\u2019s no way the Knicks call him, and then waking up at 3 AM to Thibs calling and asking \u201cyou in shape?\u201d and \u201ccan you be ready tomorrow?\u201d The best part is Gibson explaining he was told they\u2019d ease him in, but instead got thrown in the game immediately, which caused Teague to laugh and go \u201cthat\u2019s Thibs!\u201d As Teague notes, Taj is one of those guys that will always have a spot if they want it on a Thibodeau team \u2014 also admitting he is also one of Thibs\u2019 favorites from his time in Minnesota. Gibson played 16 games for the Knicks before finishing his season with the Pistons, appearing in four games, and we\u2019ll find out this summer if he ends up anywhere for training camp or if he\u2019ll just have to make a decision during the 24-25 season when the inevitable Thibs call arrives.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1024\" height=\"443\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/taj.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=443&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"taj gibson\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/taj.jpg 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/taj.jpg?resize=300,130 300w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/taj.jpg?resize=704,305 704w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/taj.jpg?resize=768,332 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"><span class=\"wp-media-credit\">Getty Image</span></figcaption>\t</figure>\n\tTaj Gibson told the hilarious story of getting woken up by Thibs calling to ask if he's in shape after Julius Randle got hurt this year.", "url": "https://uproxx.com/dimemag/taj-gibson-thibs-call-3-am-julius-randle-injury-knicks-story/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/taj2.jpg?w=710", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:45:02", "author": "Robby Kalland", "authors": ["Robby Kalland"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.111}

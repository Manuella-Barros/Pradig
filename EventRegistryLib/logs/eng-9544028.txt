pharmacare vote | CBC News", "body": "The Liberals and the New Democrats pledged to stop the Conservatives from blocking their pharmacare legislation in the House of Commons on Monday -- even though the two parties have more than enough votes to bypass the Opposition.\n\nBoth NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh and Health Minister Mark Holland gave impassioned speeches about women's freedom and access to birth control.\n\nThey accused the Conservatives of trying to deny that access to Canadian women.\n\nTheir parties carefully negotiated the bill as part of a political pact to prevent an early election, and together planned a program that will cover select contraceptive and diabetes medications and supplies.\n\nConservative health critic Stephen Ellis tabled an amendment to the bill last month that, if approved by Parliament, would effectively quash the proposed law.\n\nThe program will do nothing to address the health-care crisis, he argued, and instead offers an inferior drug plan that covers less, costs more and builds up a massive new bureaucracy.\n\nThe amendment is expected to be easily defeated by government and New Democrat MPs.\n\n\"Will the government support us in stopping the Conservatives from denying 9 million Canadians free birth control?\" Singh asked Holland during a question period exchange Monday,\n\nHolland responded by accusing the Conservatives of standing in the way of basic freedom for women in Canada.\n\n\"I will say to the Conservative Party of Canada: stop blocking this so that women can get the reproductive aids they need to have control over their reproductive futures,\" Holland said.\n\nThe Conservatives did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNotwithstanding efforts by the Liberals and NDP to conjure fears about the Tories' plans, how the official Opposition votes is not expected to alter the bill's trajectory.\n\nThe tough talk began over the weekend, when Singh penned a letter to Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre to ask him to withdraw the motion, citing the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n\"Nearly one in four Canadians have reported splitting pills, skipping doses or deciding to not fill or renew vital prescription medications due to their high costs,\" he wrote.\n\nIn social media posts, Singh framed the letter as an ultimatum. \"He can withdraw or we'll stop him,\" Singh posted on X earlier Monday.\n\nNDP health critic Peter Julian put forward a motion in the House on Monday to call on the Conservatives to withdraw that amendment, but the Tories declined.\n\nThe Conservatives have argued the vast majority of Canadians already have some form of drug coverage.\n\nEllis also criticized the list of drugs that would be covered under the program, and charged the government with failing to consult with anyone except the NDP about what medications should be included.\n\n\"It is rife with older medications, with no fees for pharmacists,\" he said during the early stages of debate in the House last month.\n\nThe Liberals moved Monday to put a five-hour time limit on further debate before the House votes on the bill for the first time later in the week.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca",

Nearly one-in-four Canadians have reported splitting pills, skipping doses, or deciding to not fill or renew vital prescription medications due to their high costs. This cannot continue,\" Singh said.\n\nThe weekend letter gave the Conservatives notice of Monday's procedural move, and stated: \"We hope that you have had time to reconsider your amendment, and that you will support moving this important initiative forward as quickly as possible.\"\n\nReacting to the outcome, Singh vowed his party will now \"use tools at our disposal to ensure Canadians have access to free birth control and diabetes medications at the earliest opportunity.\"\n\nThe government has estimated that this first phase of pharmacare - if all provinces and territories buy in - would improve access to diabetes medications and supplies that Canada's 3.7 million diabetics require, as well as provide a suite of options for the more than 9 million people of reproductive age, including oral contraceptives, IUDs, and morning-after pills.\n\nThe 2024 federal budget earmarked $1.5 billion over five years to launch the first phase of this program.\n\n\"While Canadians scrimp and save to afford food and rent, Pierre Poilievre is clear: he doesn't want you to have free life-saving medications,\" Singh said in a statement. \"While he's been benefiting from coverage paid by the public for his whole political career.\"\n\nPoilievre was at an event off of the Hill when the procedural wrangling went down Monday morning.\n\nOn Tuesday, patents affected by the pharmacare bill will coming to Parliament Hill to press politicians to strengthen Bill C-64, and pass it as soon as possible.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [],

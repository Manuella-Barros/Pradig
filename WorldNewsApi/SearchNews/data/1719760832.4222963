This new development will help many families in the community with their housing needs.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to thank Cllr Patrick McGowan for his work on this project. It was Cllr McGowan who identified the site for development a number of years ago.\u201d Commenting on the approval for construction, Cllr McGowan said: \u201cI first proposed this site to the Habinteg Housing Agency over 15 years ago. This site close to Castlefinn is easily accessible and near all services at the Castlefinn Partnership Initiative Centre, shops and bus routes. \u201cGreat credit goes to the Habinteg Housing Association committee for sticking with this project over a very long time.

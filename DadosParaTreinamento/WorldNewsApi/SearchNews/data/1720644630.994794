It\u2019s competitive.&#8217;", "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Caitlin Clark sounds ready to move on from Chennedy Carter\u2019s flagrant foul. Clark was asked before Indiana\u2019s game at Washington on Friday night whether she thinks Carter owes her a public apology, and the rookie standout dismissed the idea. \u201cNo. I mean, basketball\u2019s competitive. I get it,\u201d Clark said. \u201cSometimes your emotions get the best of you. Happened to me multiple times throughout the course of my career.\u201d Clark then took the court and made a career-high seven 3-pointers in the Fever\u2019s 85-83 win over the Mystics. She equaled her career high with 30 points. Carter, who plays for the Chicago Sky, knocked Clark to the floor before an inbounds pass in a game last weekend. The WNBA eventually upgraded the foul to a Flagrant 1, and the incident led to a larger debate over how Clark has been received in her first season in the league. \u201cPeople are competitive,\u201d Clark said Friday. \u201cIt is what it is, and she\u2019s having a tremendous season. She\u2019s played great basketball, in my eyes probably in first place for Sixth Player of the Year. \u2026 There\u2019s no grudges. There\u2019s nothing like that. It\u2019s a sport. It\u2019s competitive. It\u2019s not going to be nice all the time.\u201d", "summary": "Caitlin Clark was asked whether she thinks the Chicago Sky's Chennedy Carter owes her a public apology, and the rookie standout dismissed the idea.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/08/caitlin-clark-chennedy-carter/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/ctc-l-clark-foul-01.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:08:21", "author": "Noah Trister", "authors": ["Noah Trister"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.167}

No homes had burned and no evacuation orders had been given early Thursday. Dozens of firefighters and tankers were battling the flames, and the county website was providing residents with updates on the fire's spread.\n\nMore: Track latest wildfires, red flag warnings across the US\n\nFires have become a common occurence in Hawaii, which ranks among the states most at risk for wildfires, according to the tracking website wildfirerisk.org. Clay Trauernicht, a ecosystem fire scientist at the University of Hawaii, says Hawaii has the key ingredients for wildfires including drought, human-caused ignitions, and lowland areas dominated by nonnative, fire-prone grasses.\n\n\"These fuels expanded as money moved from plantations and ranches to tourism and real estate,\" Trauernicht said in a social media post late last year.\n\nHow did the wildfires start in Maui? A combination of factors fueled disaster\n\nThe combination brought unbearable tragedy to Maui last August, when a burst of wildfires resulted in more than 100 deaths and nearly $6 billion in damages. The primary blaze, in the coastal community of Lahaina, destroyed more than 2,700 homes, businesses and other structures. The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said this week it was completing its report on the origin and cause on the fire and will send its findings to the Maui Fire Department.\n\n\"We recognize the importance of sharing this information with the public, and plan to release our cause and origin report as soon as we receive and integrate ATF's findings,\" Maui Fire Chief Brad Ventura said Tuesday.\n\nLast month, Maui Mayor Richard Bissen signed off on a county budget that provides aid for those displaced after the 2023 August wildfires. The county has begun a \"daunting journey (for) survivors of the most complex natural disaster in Hawaii's history,\" Bissen said at the time.\n\nThe fires ignited Aug. 8 as a brush fire in the Maui Upcountry, an area of hills and volcanic mountains near the middle Hawaii's second largest island. A second fire sparked outside the coastal town of Lahaina hours later but was reported as fully contained a few hours later. But wind gusts fueled by Hurricane Dora, hundreds of miles away, fanned the fire that encircled Lahaina.\n\nThen gusting winds from Hurricane Dora, which passed the Hawaiian Islands hundreds of miles to the south, fanned the brush fires back to life. Amid the chaos, many residents of Lahaina didn't realize they were surrounded by flames as the escape routes became impassable due to the thick smoke and intense heat of the fire.\n\nA Maui County Council committee on Tuesday sent to the full council a proposed settlement that could resolve all claims and lawsuits over 2023 wildfires. The settlement, which could go to a vote as early as next week, could involve more than 450 lawsuits filed by almost 2,000 people and hundreds of businesses and other groups. Maui County, Hawaiian Electric and the state are among defendants.\n\nThe county recently filed suit against cellular carriers, saying they failed to notify police of widespread service outages during the fire. The county says it would have used means other than text messages to alert residents of the impending disaster.\n\nHaleakala National Park extends for more than 50 square miles from the 10,023 foot summit of the dormant Haleakala volcano down the southeast flank of the mountain to the Kipahulu coast near the small town of Hana. The Crater of Haleakala is a major tourist attraction in the park, which also features waterfalls and a bamboo forest. The National Park Service website notes that the last place to get gas in route to the Summit Area of the park is in the town of Pukalani.\n\n\"There are no charging stations for electric vehicles at Haleakal\u0101 National Park,\" the website warns. \"Even electric vehicles with a full charge have been unable to make it to the Summit.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Because the culture of Hawaii is focused so much on caring for the land that cares for you, the tourism organization believes that one of the major things you can do to learn about Hawaii and its culture, not to mention participate in this primary tenet, is to volunteer.\n\nSpending a few hours volunteering - removing invasive plants, cleaning up a reef, taking a dog to the beach or planting traditional crops - might turn out to be your most rewarding experience on Maui. Many projects include a bit of education about local history and the environment, so you'll take away something from the experience, too.\n\nWhere to start\n\nHawaii Tourism shares a list of organizations that offer half-day volunteer opportunities on Maui as part of its M\u0101lama Hawai\u02bbi Program. Another place to start is Hands on Maui, which is a volunteer hub for the entire island. The website shares an extensive list of volunteer agencies and their programs. It also includes immediate volunteer needs as well as opportunities to aid those displaced by the Lahaina Wildfire. The Maui Nui Strong program, supported by the Office of Economic Development, also posts volunteer opportunities on its website and lists them by date.\n\nAnother easy way to help is by donating food and household items to the Maui Food Bank or assisting with food packing. If you love being outdoors, consider volunteering at Haleakal\u0101 National Park. These projects are organized by Friends of Haleakal\u0101 National Park. Tracking and counting whales for the Pacific Whale Foundation is another possibility.\n\nPlan how you can help out with our favorite volunteer opportunities.\n\nClean up the coral\n\nNot all volunteer programs are on land. On the first Sunday of every month, Trilogy Ocean Sports offers its Blue'aina Reef Cleanup program. Alongside the staff, visitors sail out to the reef to snorkel or dive and gather trash and other debris that has been caught on the reef. Go gather up those wayward bundles of fishing nets and save a turtle or two.\n\nYou'll also get an education while you're at it. Representatives from various nonprofits, educators and experts are on hand to teach you all they know about everything from whale habitats to Hawaiian traditions.\n\nReplant the land\n\nPlanting taro on your hands and knees in the shadows of the Olowalu Valley isn't just a reenactment of ancient agricultural practices. Nope, it's also a chance to give back to Maui by helping to preserve a historically important agricultural site, all the while learning about Hawaiian culture and connecting spiritually with the land.\n\nOn a talk-story tour of the Olowalu Petroglyphs with Kipuka Olowalu, you'll learn about ancient agricultural practices and how \"clean farming\" benefits the coral reefs at nearby Olowalu Beach, the largest reef area in Maui County. Tasks may vary by visit. Volunteer days are Wednesday and Thursday from 7:30am to 11:30am and are part of the M\u0101lama Hawai\u02bbi Program. Complete the registration form online.\n\nWalk a dog\n\nSign up for the Beach Buddies Program with the Maui Humane Society, which gives visitors a chance to take dogs for beach walks. In order to spend some time with a furry companion head to the Dogs on Demand part of the Humane Society website. You'll be provided with a backpack full of supplies for your new friend, including water and a water bowl, an adopt me bandana and a car seat belt. You'll also receive a map and a list of suggested outings.\n\nHelp care for endemic plants at a National Park\n\nHaleakal\u0101 National Park offers two opportunities for visitors to help out on Maui. The first is a one-day service event held on the first Tuesday of every month. Volunteers help horticulturists care for the endemic plants that thrive in the park, doing anything including transplanting, clearing weed beds, and cleaning and preparing seeds for storage or planting. Most of this work is done inside and its easy to get to. Reservations are required.\n\nThe second opportunity at Haleakala National Park allows you to stay overnight in the park. You'll be required to carry a backpack with your supplies and be able to hike and work in muddy and adverse weather conditions. But, you'll get to camp inside a crater and help staff get cabins up to snuff for visitors, pull invasive plant species and generally upkeep the more remote areas of the park. In order to sign up for this trip, you'll need to follow the instructions on this website.\n\nClean up the beach\n\nRedline Rafting is also supporting Malama Hawai'i and organizing a way for visitors to help keep the beaches and trails clean. At the Kihei Boat Ramp, the rafting company has set up gray trucks filled with reusable malt bags and trash grabbers.\n\nIt's DIY so just take a bag and grabber and get to work. You can dispose of the litter yourself or leave it in the bed of the trucks and Redline will take care of it. Be sure to snap a photo and tag @redlinerafting on social media with the hashtag #malamahawaii for a 5% discount on two tickets on any of Redline's tours. Be sure to leave your reusable bag and grabber in the truck so they can be cleaned for another volunteer.", "source": {"uri": "lonelyplanet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lonely Planet"},

{"id": 227478458, "title": "Why D-Day was even more spectacular than remembered", "text": "June 6 marks 80 years since Allied Forces landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, as part of Operation Overlord, the campaign to defeat the Nazis and liberate Western Europe. Now, a pair of new books \u2014 one charting the story of the Allied invasion, a second examining another key moment in World War II just two days prior to the D-Day landings \u2014 reveal the realities, tragedies, challenges and strategic successes of the Allied Forces. On June 4, 1944, the US Navy captured a Nazi U-505 submarine. It was not only the first and only vessel to ever be successfully towed home to America, but also the first time an intact enemy warship had been seized since the War of 1812 with the British. In \u201cCodename Nemo: The Hunt for a Nazi U-Boat and the Elusive Enigma Machine\u201d (Diversion Books), author Charles Lachman recounts the story of how, after months of hunting, a US Navy Task Force, led by Captain Daniel V. Galley on the aircraft carrier USS Guadalcanal tracked down and captured this deadly killing machine. The U-505 had been spotted by two of the Guadalcanal\u2019s fighter planes, running on the surface in the Atlantic Ocean 150 miles off the coast of western Africa, prompting the submarine\u2019s commander, Kapit\u00e4nleutnant Harald Lange, to dive his vessel deep before Gallery launched depth charges to force it back to the surface. Fearing his boat was about to break up, Lange ordered his 60-strong crew to abandon ship before readying the 14 detonator charges on board in a bid to destroy it. \u201cScuttling the submarine is the standard order of business for any well-disciplined U-boat crew. Like the US Navy\u2019s sacred battle cry, \u201cDon\u2019t give up the ship,\u201d the Germans, above all, must keep their vessel from falling into enemy hands,\u201d Lachman wrties. But with most of the crew now swimming for their lives, there was nobody left to detonate the charges, and when the sub surfaced it was met with a US boarding party, who not only prevented it from sinking but also captured its crew, technology, its encryption codes and an Enigma cipher machine. \u201cIt was,\u201d says Lachman, \u201cone of the greatest intelligence windfalls of the war.\u201d Of the U-505\u2019s crew, just one was killed in the operation. The other 59 became prisoners of war and were taken across the Atlantic to a POW camp in Ruston, Louisiana. \u201cEvery now and then, the Guadalcanal rises on an ocean swell, and that\u2019s when the POWs catch sight of their beloved U-505 and realize she\u2019s being towed by the carrier. \u201cMost distressing of all, she\u2019s flying an American flag.\u201d But as Lachman explains, it wasn\u2019t just the Stars and Stripes flying strong. \u201cBelow Old Glory is a smaller flag -\u2013 the Nazi flag \u2013 with swastika. In Navy tradition, it is a symbol of victor over vanquished.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until eight days after Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender in May 1945 that the Navy Office of Public Relations finally revealed that the U-505 had been captured. None of the 3,000 sailors involved in the Task Force ever uttered a word about the capture in the 11 months that had passed. Indeed, the cover-up was so successful that German high command believed their U-505 was on the ocean floor somewhere off of Africa, along with its crew and intelligence secrets. \u201cFor Captain Dan Gallery, this is perhaps Codename Nemo\u2019s most impressive achievement,\u201d writes Lachman. \u201cThe boys did keep their mouths shut,\u201d says Gallery. \u201cI think this speaks very highly indeed for the devotion to duty and sense of responsibility.\u201d Today, the U-505 is on display in Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry. Two days after the U-505\u2019s capture, more than 156,000 Allied troops landed on the beaches of Normandy, as Operation Overlord, the campaign to wrest control back from the Nazis in Europe, entered a decisive phase. In \u201cWhen The Sea Came Alive: An Oral History of D-Day\u201d (Avid Reader Press) historian Garrett Graff has gathered recollections of more than 700 people involved in this pivotal moment of World War II. \u201cJune 6, 1944, is one of the most famous single days in all of human history,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe official launch of Operation Overlord marks a feat of unprecedented human audacity, a mission more complex than anything ever seen and a key turning point in the fight for a cause among the most noble humans have ever fought.\u201d While some names are familiar, the majority will feel new. They are soldiers and French villagers, German troops and the housewives left behind, who tell their stories, creating an intimate report of D-Day in often visceral detail. \u201cOperation Overlord is a story dominated by historic figures \u2014 Winston Churchill, Dwight Eisenhower, George Marshall, Omar Bradley \u2014 and the big, world-shaping decisions they make,\u201d writes Graff. Still, he adds, \u201cthe greatest names, as it turns out, are the ones you don\u2019t know.\u201d The oral history covers everything from preparations for the invasion to US troops arriving in Britain at the rate of 5,000 each day between 1943 and 1944. Operation Overlord was the largest seaborne invasion in history. During the 24 hours of June 6, the Strategic Air Forces \u2014 with over 11,500 aircraft \u2014 flew 5,309 sorties to drop 10,395 tons of bombs, while aircraft of the tactical forces flew a further 5,276 sorties. When the invasion launched, over 73,000 US troops landed on Omaha and Utah beaches, supported by nearly 7,000 naval vessels. They were joined by over 61,000 British soldiers who landed at Gold and Sword Beaches and another 21,000 Canadians attacking at Juno Beach. \u201cThe battle scene was the most awesome terrible thing a human being could ever witness,\u201d recalls Seaman Exum Pike, on the submarine chaser USS PC-565. \u201cLooking back on that day, after these many years, I have two grown sons and as I have often told them boys I have no fear of hell because I have already been there.\u201d Like countless others, Capt. George Mabry, an operations officer with 8th Infantry Regiment, witnessed that hell. \u201cWe\u2019d been trained that once you hit the beach, you run. Ahead of me was a man carrying ammunition. A round hit the top of his head . . . and this man\u2019s body completely disappeared,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt something hit my thigh; it was his thumb.\u201d Sgt. Jerry Salinger, Counter Intelligence Corps, puts it more graphically. \u201cYou never really get the smell of burned flesh out of your nose entirely, no matter how long you live.\u201d Some 4,414 Allied soldiers died on Normandy\u2019s beaches. \u201cWhen I landed D-Day morning, I had 35 men in my platoon and in my boat,\u201d says Lt. John J. Reville, 5th Ranger Battalion. \u201cAt the end of seven days, there was myself and four men left.\u201d By June 30, the Allied forces had more than 850,000 troops, nearly 150,000 vehicles and 57,000 tons of supplies in Normandy, paving the way for victory. It\u2019s best summed up by Charles R. Sullivan of the 111th Naval Construction Battalion. \u201cNormandy and D-Day remain vivid, as if it only happened yesterday. What we did was important and worthwhile,\u201d he says. \u201cHow many ever get to say that about a day in their lives?\u201d", "summary": "June 6 marks 80 years since Allied Forces landed on the beaches of Normandy, France, as part of Operation Overlord, the campaign to defeat the Nazis and liberate Western Europe.&nbsp; Now, a pair of new books \u2014 one charting the story of the Allied invasion, a second examining another key moment in World War II...", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/02/lifestyle/d-day-was-even-more-spectacular-than-remembered/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/newspress-collage-1i0d0v7zo-1717002640572.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1716988367&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:00", "author": "Gavin Newsham", "authors": ["Gavin Newsham"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.14}

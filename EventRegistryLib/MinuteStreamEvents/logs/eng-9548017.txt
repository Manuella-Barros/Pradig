Thinking about it after the fact, I think there should be a line back there, you know, for the catchers and just have them stay behind the line. That way, no one can get any closer than the next guy.

He is hitting .280 with six homers and 12 RBIs. The 31-year-old is in the second year of a five-year, $87.5 million contract.\n\n\"It's a tough one, man,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He's been doing such a phenomenal job. He's an extreme competitor. He brings so much to the club performance-wise, but also with just his competitive nature, so to see him go down is tough. I feel for him, I really do.

After he was clipped by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain and then jogged away before sitting down while was examined by St. Louis training staff.\n\nCardinals manager Oliver Marmol gave a postgame update that doesn't bode well for Contreras, per John Denton of MLB.com:\n\n\"#STLCards manager Oli Marmol said there's a potential that Willson Contreras might need surgery on his fractured left forearm.\"\n\nContreras doubled and scored during St. Louis' three-run first. He is hitting .280 with six homers and 12 RBIs this season.\n\nCardinals' facing challenges at catcher\n\nShould Contreras require surgery on his fractured forearm, he'll miss an extended period of time. It's likely that Ivan Herrera, who took over for Contreras on Tuesday, would get the not as the Cardinals' everyday catcher.\n\nUnfortunately, Herrera is not nearly the player that Contreras is. While he's still only 23 years old and has plenty of time to develop, he doesn't provide much pop in his bat. Across three seasons in his career, the 5-foot-11, 220-pound catcher is slashing .221/.295/.320 with three homers and 16 RBI. Contreras, on the other hand, has a .258/.352/.463 slash line with 143 homers and 144 RBI.\n\nBut it's not just offense that this injury will affect. Catcher is a critical defensive position that requires comfort with the starting pitching staff and an ability to call a solid game. Pitchers are creatures of habit, and it will be an adjustment to switch to a new battery mate for the coming months.\n\nContreras is a three-time All-Star and a former World Series champion, winning back in 2016 with the Cubs. He was also one of the few players on the squad doing well at the plate. He ranks second on the team (among starters) in batting average, and also leads in homers. Contreras and Nolan Arenado are the only starters on the Cardinals hitting over .270.\n\nComparing the players is inherently unfair due to Contreras being eight years older. However, the point is that the Cardinals will have to deal with a significant downgrade at the catcher position, through no fault of Herrera's own.\n\nSt. Louis is currently sitting at 15-21 this season. That puts them in last place in the National League Central division.

On Tuesday, they got even worse.\n\nCatcher Willson Contreras, who had been one of the team's few consistent hitters through its 15-20 start, left Tuesday's game against the New York Mets with an injury to his left arm. The injury looked bad at the time.\n\nShortly after Contreras left the game, the Cardinals announced on Twitter/X that \"Contreras was removed from tonight's game due to a left-arm fracture.\"\n\nThe injury occurred in the second inning. New York's J.D. Martinez offered at a 2-1 pitch from St. Louis pitcher, Miles Mikolas. As Contreras went to catch the ball, his left arm got in the path of Martinez's swing. Catcher's interference was called, awarding Martinez first base. Contreras, meanwhile, was in obvious pain. The catcher was holding his left forearm and later wrist.\n\nAt the least, this will likely sideline Contreras for several weeks.\n\nContreras, in his second season with the Cardinals, has slashed .274/.394/.538 this season.

He was forced to exit Tuesday night's game against the New York Mets (NYM-STL GameTracker) in the second inning after J.D. Martinez's swing caught him on the left forearm. Soon after the Cardinals announced that Contreras had suffered a left arm fracture. After the game, Contreras told reporters that he was informed he would be out at least six to eight weeks.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the Cardinals officially placed Contreras on the injured list and recalled 25-year-old catcher Pedro Pag\u00e9s in a corresponding move.\n\nConteras was down on the field in obvious pain for several minutes before leaving the game and being replaced behind the plate by Iv\u00e1n Herrera. Here's a look at the play:\n\nAs you can see, Martinez caught Contreras' arm on the forward portion of the swing as opposed to the less powerful backswing phase. As such, Martinez was awarded first base on catcher's interference. Contreras this season in an effort to improve his receiving typically sets up closer to the plate than he has in the past. That plus the lunge forward to catch the slider from starter Miles Mikolas put Contreras in harm's way.\n\n\"You're expecting to hit a ball and you hit an arm,\" Martinez told reporters after the game. \"And you're like, what was that? I hit meat. I felt I hit meat. I didn't hit just a glove where you point back at the catcher. It was solid. Dude, I hit him good. When I got to first, I felt terrible.\"\n\nGiven that Contreras is facing a lengthy recovery period, his absence will be a blow to the Cardinals. In addition to his improved framing behind the plate, he's also far and away been St. Louis' most productive hitter in 2024. Earlier in Tuesday's contest, he hit a ringing double, which brought his slash line for the season to .280/.398/.551. That's elite production for any hitter, let alone one who mans the catcher position.

Martinez's bat", "body": "ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras broke his left forearm when he was hit by a swing during Tuesday night's 7-5 loss to the New York Mets.\n\nContreras told reporters he will need surgery and miss at least six weeks.\n\n\"So right now I mean, I'm in pain pretty good, but I'm really upset missing,\" Contreras said. \"I know that it's going to be tough for me to watch the games and not out there with the guys, but I'm going to do my best to stay present, pick each other up and cheer for them because that's the best thing I can do.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was clipped by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain and then jogged away before sitting down while was examined by St. Louis' training staff.\n\n\"I hit meat,\" Martinez said. \"I felt like I hit meat. I didn't hit like just like a glove where you kind of just point back to catcher, it was just solid. I was like, dude, I hit him good. ... I felt terrible.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base due to catcher's interference. The team said Contreras had a left forearm fracture, and Iv\u00e1n Herrera took over behind the plate.\n\nContreras said he thought Martinez was a little late on his swing, which led to bad timing.\n\n\"I think if he sees the pitch well, he'd try to hit a little up front and he wouldn't hit me,\" Contreras said. \"I'm not blaming him. He's doing his thing. Things happen for a reason.\"\n\nCardinals starter Miles Mikolas called Contreras the team's \"beating heart\" behind the plate.\n\n\"He's close to the plate trying to steal strikes,\" Mikolas said. \"You know, as pitchers we appreciate that, but you know, if we knew he was going to get hurt, I'd rather throw all balls. ... Thinking about it after the fact, I think there should be a line back there, you know, for the catchers and just have them stay behind the line. That way, no one can get any closer than the next guy. And if you put them back there in a spot that's deemed safe, and you know, that might help guys.\"\n\nContreras doubled and scored during St. Louis' three-run first. He is hitting .280 with six homers and 12 RBIs. The 31-year-old is in the second year of a five-year, $87.5 million contract.\n\n\"It's a tough one, man,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He's been doing such a phenomenal job. He's an extreme competitor. He brings so much to the club performance-wise, but also with just his competitive nature, so to see him go down is tough. I feel for him, I really do. He was putting together a really nice year and helping us in a lot of ways so it's a tough one.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

It has since been reported that his arm was fractured in the incident.\n\nAs we can see from the replay, the incident was indeed an interference, as Contreras' arm was extended towards the swing of the bat, which caught his forearm. It was a nasty hit that left the catcher howling in pain. Contreras was then replaced by Ivan Herrera on catcher duty after his forced exit.\n\nWillson Contreras was signed by the Chicago Cubs as an international free agent in 2009 and went on to make his major league debut with them in 2016.

Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was clipped by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain and then jogged away before sitting down while was examined by St. Louis' training staff.\n\n\"I hit meat,\" Martinez said. \"I felt like I hit meat. I didn't hit like just like a glove where you kind of just point back to catcher, it was just solid. I was like, dude, I hit him good. ... I felt terrible.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base due to catcher's interference. The team said Contreras had a left forearm fracture, and Iv\u00e1n Herrera took over behind the plate.\n\nContreras said he thought Martinez was a little late on his swing, which led to bad timing.\n\n\"I think if he sees the pitch well, he'd try to hit a little up front and he wouldn't hit me,\" Contreras said. \"I'm not blaming him. He's doing his thing. Things happen for a reason.\"\n\nCardinals starter Miles Mikolas called Contreras the team's \"beating heart\" behind the plate.\n\n\"He's close to the plate trying to steal strikes,\" Mikolas said. \"You know, as pitchers we appreciate that, but you know, if we knew he was going to get hurt, I'd rather throw all balls. ... Thinking about it after the fact, I think there should be a line back there, you know, for the catchers and just have them stay behind the line. That way, no one can get any closer than the next guy. And if you put them back there in a spot that's deemed safe, and you know, that might help guys.\"\n\nContreras doubled and scored during St. Louis' three-run first.

The 31-year-old is in the second year of a five-year, $87.5 million contract.\n\n\"It's a tough one, man,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He's been doing such a phenomenal job. He's an extreme competitor. He brings so much to the club performance-wise, but also with just his competitive nature, so to see him go down is tough. I feel for him, I really do.

Where do the Cardinals go from here?", "body": "ST. LOUIS -- For a few fleeting moments, it seemed as if St. Louis Cardinals finally caught a break.\n\nThey entered play Tuesday a season-worst five games under .500. But the Cardinals' lifeless offense sprang into action early, tagging New Mets starter Jos\u00e9 Butt\u00f3 for three runs in the first inning and providing a much-needed spark for both the dugout and the home crowd.\n\nJust a few minutes later, that spark was promptly snuffed out.\n\nAfter doubling and scoring a run in the first inning, Willson Contreras -- arguably the Cardinals' most valuable player this season -- was struck squarely on the left arm by the swing of Mets' designated hitter J.D. Martinez in the top of the second. It was clear something was terribly wrong on impact. Contreras fell to the ground and screamed while clutching his forearm. Manager Oli Marmol and head trainer Adam Olsen rushed onto the field. As Contreras sat near the dugout, writhing in pain, an unnerving hush settled over Busch Stadium. No good news was coming out of this scene.\n\nX-rays revealed a fractured left arm for Contreras. He'll undergo surgery and is looking at a recovery timeline of six to eight weeks. He was optimistic and in relatively good spirits after the game, all things considered, and hopeful to return to the majors before the All-Star break.\n\nBut make no mistake: Losing Contreras is about as bad as it gets for a Cardinals team that can't afford to lose much else.\n\n\"This is the most pain I've been through, for sure,\" Contreras said after the game. \"I knew right away it was a bad situation.\"\n\nWith his left arm wrapped and in a sling, Contreras was adamant he was not blaming Martinez for where he was set up in the batter's box, nor would he have changed his own position behind the plate. As the importance of framing -- or \"stealing strikes\" -- becomes more relevant, teams and catchers have started receiving pitches as close to the plate as possible. The Cardinals are no exception and moved Contreras to the back edge of the batter's box when he first took over behind the plate before the 2023 season. Over the offseason, there was a further emphasis on his set-up behind the plate to improve his framing on pitches low in the strike zone. Contreras showed dramatic improvement this year and he did not blame his injury on where he was positioned.\n\n\"There's always a risk being a catcher,\" Contreras said. \"Could have been something different. It could've been off my knee, it could be a concussion. That risk is always going to be there. I'm not blaming any part of my game because this happened tonight. When I get back, I'm going to try to be the same guy behind the plate.\"\n\nReserve catcher Iv\u00e1n Herrera will take over primary duties behind the plate in Contreras' absence. Pedro Pag\u00e9s, who has appeared in five games for St. Louis this season, was en route from Triple-A Memphis on Tuesday night and is expected to be activated as the team's backup catcher ahead of Wednesday's game. Herrera has made strides defensively and leaned on Contreras as a mentor throughout the season. This will be his first stint as an everyday catcher in the major leagues.\n\n\"He's matured a lot,\" Contreras said. \"He's only 23 years old and he has a lot to learn, but the one thing I like about him is that he's always willing to listen, always asking something. That's going to make him better.\"\n\nThe larger -- and much more unclear -- question is how the Cardinals will replace Contreras' invaluable offensive production. He was the lone bright spot amid one of baseball's worst offenses. The Cardinals have struggled to score this season. They have the fewest home runs in the National League (25) and the third-lowest OPS (.636). Contreras and his .280/.352/.464 clip and team-high six home runs have been responsible for most of the lineup's production. With several Cardinals hitters underperforming -- including the heart of the order -- there is no immediate answer regarding who can replace the Contreras-sized hole in their lineup.\n\n\"I feel for him because there was a lot of work that went into (his season),\" Marmol said. \"He was doing a nice job behind the plate, framing, all of it. His offensive numbers were really good. It's something we're going to have to overcome.\"\n\nThe Cardinals lost on Tuesday night, 7-5. A six-run fifth inning by the Mets sealed their fate. They are six games under .500 and in last place in their division.\n\nAnd still, none of that comes close to being without their All-Star catcher for the foreseeable future. Losing Contreras was their biggest loss of all.", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_woo@theathletic.com", "name": "Katie Woo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Soon after the Cardinals announced that Contreras had suffered a left arm fracture.\n\nConteras was down on the field in obvious pain for several minutes before leaving the game and being replaced behind the plate by Iv\u00e1n Herrera. Here's a look at the play:\n\nAs you can see, Martinez caught Contreras' arm on the forward portion of the swing as opposed to the less powerful backswing phase. As such, Martinez was awarded first base on catcher's interference. Contreras this season in an effort to improve his receiving typically sets up closer to the plate than he has in the past. That plus the lunge forward to catch the slider from starter Miles Mikolas put Contreras in harm's way.\n\nGiven that Contreras is almost certainly facing a lengthy recovery period, his absence will be a blow to the Cardinals. In addition to his improved framing behind the plate, he's also far and away been St. Louis' most productive hitter in 2024. Earlier in Tuesday's contest, he hit a ringing double, which brought his slash line for the season to .280/.398/.551. That's elite production for any hitter, let alone one who mans the catcher position. Compounding Contreras' value to the Cardinals is just how bad the rest of the offense has been.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Cardinals entered Tuesday night's game with a 15-20 record and in last place in the National League Central.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dayn_perry@cbssports.com", "name": "Dayn Perry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

He caught for 19 seasons with the Minnesota Twins, San Francisco Giants, Chicago White Sox, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, and Atlanta Braves. He also spent 30 games with the Cardinals in 2014.\n\nCardinals will be without Willson Contreras for extended period\n\nCardinals manager Oliver Marmol gave a postgame update that doesn't bode well for Contreras, saying that there's a potential that he will need to have surgery on his fractured forearm.\n\nShould Contreras require surgery on his fractured forearm, he'll miss an extended period of time. It's likely that Ivan Herrera, who took over for Contreras on Tuesday, would get the not as the Cardinals' everyday catcher.\n\nUnfortunately, Herrera is not even remotely the player that Contreras is. While he's still just 23 years old and has plenty of time to develop into an impact player at the Major League level, he doesn't provide much pop in his bat. Across three seasons in his career, the 5-foot-11, 220-pound catcher is slashing .221/.295/.320 with three homers and 16 RBI.\n\nContreras, on the other hand, has a .258/.352/.463 slash line with 143 homers and 144 RBI. He is also a three-time All-Star and a former World Series champion, winning back in 2016 with the Cubs. Contreras was also one of the few players on the squad doing well at the plate. He ranks second on the team (among starters) in batting average, and also leads in homers. Contreras and Nolan Arenado are the only starters on the Cardinals hitting over .270.\n\nSt. Louis is currently sitting at 15-21 this season.

The Cardinals' catcher raced from behind the plate, screaming loud enough for fans in front of the third-floor press box to hear him. Eventually he sat near the on-deck circle, his legs straight out, his eyes pinched, and his forearm cradled in an immobile pinch by the Cardinals' head athletic trainer.\n\nContreras left the field and left the game after several minutes.\n\nA scan taken at the ballpark revealed the fracture that will cause Contreras to miss a significant amount of time.

At Class AAA Memphis, catcher Pedro Pages was replaced by a pinch-hitter and is presumably on his way to St. Louis to be activated ahead of Wednesday's game.\n\nContreras, of course, was part of the initiating rally.\n\nIn the first, the Cardinals pushed for three runs, as many or more than they've scored in nearly a third of their first 35 games this season. Batting third to start Tuesday's game at Busch Stadium, Contreras ripped a line drive that was hit so hard that it stayed on a line, glanced off the left fielder's glove, and still had the power to carry to the wall. His double put two runners in scoring position and both of them scored.\n\nThe double left Contreras' bat at 113.1 mph - one of the hardest hits of the Cardinals' season so far.\n\nEntering the game, Contreras was the Cardinals' leader on offense with six home runs, a .274 average, a .538 slugging percentage, and 12 RBIs to go with 19 runs scored. His RBI double was one of the pivotal hits in the Cardinals' three-run inning Monday night before they lost, 4-3, to the New York Mets and continued a losing streak that reached three games.\n\nThe Cardinals recently returned catcher Pages to Class AAA Memphis. Pages has earned the trust of the pitching staff with his cameos in the majors this season and his work during spring training. Although he has not been in the minors for the mandatory minimum amount of days following a demotion, Pages would be immediately eligible to return to the majors due to an injury.\n\nAdding error to injury, Contreras was called for a catcher's interference on the Martinez swing. Martinez was given first base, and that is where he watched Contreras writhe and then sit in pain.\n\n0 Comments\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify\n\nTags Pro-baseball St. Louis Cardinals Cardinals Derrick Goold Willson Contreras New York Mets Mets", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derrick_goold@stltoday.com", "name": "Derrick Goold", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballpark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_University_in_St._Louis", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington University in St. Louis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_County,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis County, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midtown_St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midtown St. Louis"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Louis_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint Louis University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez's swing and the Cardinals catcher's forearm collided near the plate. Contreras was reaching in for a slider when Martinez's bat dropped hard and fast into the middle of his arm and swept up toward the left wrist and mitt.\n\nContreras' anguished scream could be heard in the upper deck at Busch Stadium.\n\nOne of the Cardinals' leading offensive players and in many ways their most consistent and most valuable player for the first 35 games of the season, Contreras will miss a lengthy period of time and possibly the remainder of the season due to the fracture. The Cardinals took scans of the injury at the ballpark, though the extent of the damage and specifics of the bones broken were not immediately known. The team said surgery is possible.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Busch Stadium needs renovations. Should St. Louis taxpayers kick in?

'It's my university's turn.'\n\nIt had been Contreras, of course, who helped the Cardinals take a lead.\n\nIt was several innings after his injury that it vanished, too.\n\nCardinals starter Miles Mikolas faced six Mets batters in the fifth inning and did not get an out. The Mets' six-run chomp overtook the Cardinals' early lead and gave them room to survive some late-game threats from the Cardinals on the way to a 7-5 victory at Busch Stadium. Alec Burleson and Lars Nootbaar launched homers in the closing innings to tighten the score. Nootbaar's came in the ninth and sparked what became a second chance for Paul Goldschmidt. The Cardinals had the tying run on base for him with one out in the ninth when he struck out.\n\nFormer Cardinal Adam Ottavino struck out two batters to freeze those baserunners there and close out the game for his first save of the season.\n\nThe Cardinals lost their fourth consecutive game, assured they would lose both series in this home stand, and now look at a long stretch without a player who has become more than just a part of the battery - but a furnace of energy, passion, and production.\n\nContreras writhes in pain\n\nSix batters into the game, Cardinals starter Miles Mikolas had retired four and faced his former college roommate, the Mets new designated hitter J.D. Martinez. Maritnez fouled off a 2-0 fastball, and Mikolas came back to the inside part of the plate with a 2-1 slider.\n\nThat was the pitch that brought Martinez's bat down on Contreras' arm.\n\nContreras wheeled immediately away from the plate in clear agony. He eventually sat down near the on-deck circle, where he pinched his eyes shut, stretched out his legs, and the Cardinals' head athletic trainer braced Contreras' left arm between his two hands. Contreras has previously injured his left hand and wrist when hit by a pitch that left a deep, lingering bone bruise that bothered him through the season's first month.\n\nAs Contreras has worked to become a better receiver at catcher and steal the low strikes for the Cardinals, he and the club moved him closer to the plate before the 2023 season. This was part of the work he did in his first spring training with the Cardinals, in 2023. This past offseason, while working with his younger brother, Brewers' catcher William Contreras, the older Contreras adjusted how he held his mitt so that he could better frame pitches. He also did more work from a one-knee down stance.\n\nThroughout the majors, catchers are closing that gap with the plate in an attempt to improve pitch-framing metrics, and there has been a spike in catcher interference calls as a result. In 2022 there were 74 catcher interference calls, according to MLB. In August 2023, there were already 76 catcher interference calls to reset the record, and that number swelled to more than 90. During a game between the younger Contreras' Brewers and the Dodgers, he was a part of two catcher interference calls with the same batter: Martinez.\n\nAdding error to injury, Martinez received first base on the catcher's interference and stood there as Contreras winced in pain near the on-deck circle. The inning ended without the Mets taking advantage.\n\nIvan Herrera replaced Contreras at catcher and had two singles.\n\nAt Class AAA Memphis' game, prospect Pedro Pages was removed for a pinch-hitter as he'll likely return to St. Louis ahead of Wednesday's game to be the backup catcher. Pages has twice been with the Cardinals already this season and earned trust from the pitching staff with his work during the spring.\n\nDonovan, Cardinals strike fast\n\nFour pitches into the game, Brendan Donovan had his fourth home run and the Cardinals had something they've so rarely had in the past week -- an early and substantial lead.\n\nA club that has scored three or fewer runs in nearly a third of their games had three runs from their first three batters of the game and a quick 3-0 lead on the Mets and starter Jose Butto. Donovan opened the scoring with his second career leadoff homer. He drilled the fourth pitch he saw into the right-field seats, and the Cardinals pressed on from there. Contreras got immediately involved with his second double in as many games against the Mets.\n\nThe team-leader with six home runs, Contreras was in the middle of the Cardinals' three-run burst to briefly tie Monday night's game. He provided the only run in Sunday's loss to the Sox, and while the rest of the lineup has had its fits and starts or just slumps, Contreras has been a steadying presence. He stung a line drive that was hit so hard that it remained elevated, glanced of the left fielder's glove, and still had the pace to carry to the wall.\n\nThe bolt left Contreras bat at 113.1 mph.\n\nThat was one of the hardest hits of the season so far for the Cardinals.\n\nRuled a double, Contreras' laser moved two runners into scoring position, and both would come around the score. Nolan Arenado's sacrifice fly scored Lars Nootbaar and Burleson's first RBI of the game came on a single to score Contreras for a 3-0 lead.\n\nMets key on Mikolas, obliterate Cards' lead\n\nWithin the first three batters of the fifth inning, that lead had vanished.\n\nWithin the first six, it had been overtaken.\n\nAnd still Mikolas did not have an out.\n\nAfter being lulled into scoreless innings by the right-hander during four scoreless innings, the Mets keyed on Mikolas quickly in the fifth inning and whipsawed through six consecutive hits before the Cardinals removed their starter from the trouble. Two singles that did not travel farther than the reach of an infielder were followed by three extra-base hits in the next four batters. In its third look at Mikolas, his curveball, and his sequence of pitches, the top of the Mets' lineup went 4 for 4 with two doubles, a homer, and five RBIs.\n\nA day after winning a game with a solo homer against the Cardinals, Mets leadoff hitter Nimmo tied the game with a three-run homer. Alonso's two-run double chased Mikolas from the game and broke the 3-3 tie to put the Mets ahead. Including Martinez's RBI single later in the inning off reliever Kyle Leahy, the Mets sent 11 batters to the plate in the decisive fifth inning. Former batting champ Jeff McNeil started the inning with a single and continued it with a single before Leahy could escape.\n\nGolden chance, squandered\n\nIn the seventh, Herrrea singled to load the bases and bring the game around to the hitters usually at the top and front and center of the Cardinals' lineup. With the bases loaded, one out, and a three-run deficit the Cardinals gave Nolan Arenado and Paul Goldschmidt each a crack at bringing them back into the game.\n\nBurleson had homered in the sixth to cut into the Mets' lead.\n\nThe tying run was in scoring position for both of the players who finished top three in voting for the 2022 National League MVP. Arenado popped up to an infielder. Goldschmidt, the winner of that MVP and now stuck in a profound funk to start the season, struck out to end the best opportunity the Cardinals had until the game found him again in the ninth.\n\n0 Comments Tags Pro-baseball St. Louis Cardinals Cardinals J.d.

Contreras immediately hollered and crumpled in pain as manager Oli Marmol and head trainer Adam Olsen sprinted out of the home dugout.\n\nContreras fell to the ground and clutched his left arm near the dugout, clearly in both physical pain and emotional distress.

Catcher Willson Contreras left the Redbirds' game on May 7 against the New York Mets with a broken arm.\n\nContreras suffered the injury in the second inning of the contest when he was hit in the arm by a JD Martinez swing. On May 8, the Cardinals officially placed Contreras on the injured list and recalled 25-year-old catcher Pedro Pag\u00e9s from Triple-A Memphis.\n\nContreras, 31, is expected to be out at least 6-8 weeks, according to a report from MLB.com's John Denton.\n\nAnytime a team loses their starting catcher, it's cause for concern. But Contreras' injury is double jeopardy for St. Louis, as he's been the club's most consistent hitter in 2024. Before getting hurt, he was hitting .280 with six home runs and 12 RBI. For a team that's only averaging 3.5 runs per game so far this season and is struggling on offense, it was a significant blow.\n\nIn the top of the second, the Mets' Martinez caught Contreras' left arm on his forward swing - rather than the more common backswing. The catcher immediately grabbed his forearm and was attended to by the Cardinals' training staff.\n\nX-rays later revealed the severity of the injury. Contreras spoke to the media later about what happened in the play.\n\n\"It was numb, and I knew it wasn't right,\" Contreras said. \"Once I tried to do some motion stuff, there was some cracking in [the arm] and I knew it was bad.\"\n\nIvan Herrera will take over starting duties in place of Contreras. The 23-year-old has a .232 batting average with three home runs and 11 RBI in 69 at-bats this season. Contreras said he offered the youngster plenty of encouragement in assuming the role.\n\n\"[Herrera] came in asking me how I was feeling, and when I said I had a fracture, he put his head down,\" Contreras said. \"The one thing I told him was, 'You don't need to put your head down; you need to pick me up.' He's really good, and he needs to keep the same focus he's had since spring training.\"\n\nContreras' injury is just another in a long line for the Cardinals in 2024. Even before they got out of the gate, the team left spring training shorthanded, with their staff ace, Sonny Gray, and three key position players unable to make the opening day roster.\n\nAdd to that the recent back injury to pitcher Steven Matz - the only lefthander in the starting rotation - and the team's training staff continues to stay busy.\n\nThat's not good news for a club that finished 71-91 in 2023 and was looking for a big turnaround this season. They began 15-21 through their first 36 games to start the 2024 campaign - last in the National League Central.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_boman@heavy.com", "name": "Ryan Boman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denton,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Memphis, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-ray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Gray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Gray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Matz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Matz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Position player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151422378.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548017", "eventUri": "eng-9548017", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 163, "textEnd": 168}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 335, "textEnd": 340}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Martinez's swing", "body": "The St. Louis Cardinals are having a nightmare season, and it just got even worse. Their catcher, Willson Contreras, needs surgery and will be out for 6-8 weeks after sustaining a left forearm fracture during Tuesday night's game against the New York Mets.\n\nThe way the fracture happened was a freak accident. In the top of the second inning, his arm was hit by J.D. Martinez's bat as it was swinging at a pitch. As soon as the bat hit body, it was clear something was wrong. Contreras immediately fell over onto the ground, shouting and writhing in pain, and left the game shortly after.\n\nIt might seem like catchers get hit with bats all the time, but it's not that common. The hitter and catcher are typically set up with the perfect amount of distance between them to avoid contact. Martinez was standing right in the middle of the box, and Contreras, in his ninth year in the majors, is a seasoned veteran who shouldn't have an issue finding his position at the plate.\n\nSo what happened? It turns out the Cardinals wanted Contreras, who statistically has been the most valuable player on the entire team, to improve his framing a bit. According to Cardinals beat writer John Denton, the Cards wanted Contreras to get more low strikes, so they moved him up closer to the plate. Unfortunately, moving him up that little bit is why he was in the path of Martinez's bat.\n\nThat Contreras was injured due to a Cardinals intervention feels perfectly in line with the season the team has been having. Tuesday night's 7-5 loss was their sixth in their last eight games. They're 15-21, six games below .500, and in last place in the National League Central. As for their other heavy hitters, Paul Goldschmidt is hitting .195 and Nolan Arenado's power has gone completely missing. Without Contreras, who is hitting a team-best .280/.398/.551, the team's cumulative wins above replacement is actually in the negative.\n\nAll the Cardinals can do now is wait for Contreras to heal. Until he returns, backup Iv\u00e1n Herrera will be manning the backstop.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_fracture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bone fracture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Mandatory Credit: Jim Rassol-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe news on Willson Contreras is bad, but perhaps not quite as bad as it could have been.\n\nThe St. Louis Cardinals catcher Contreras broke his arm during Tuesday's game against the New York Mets. He was behind the plate when he was accidentally struck in the left arm by the bat of Mets slugger JD Martinez (video here).\n\nContreras revealed to reporters this week that he will have surgery on his arm in the coming days, per John Denton of MLB.com. He added that the doctors expect him to miss six-to-eight weeks. Contreras is thus hoping to return by the MLB All-Star Game in July.\n\nThat seems like good news all things considered for the three-time All-Star Contreras. The Cardinals will definitely miss his offensive production as Contreras had been their best hitter this year with six homers and 12 RBIs on a .280 batting average and a team-high .950 OPS. But they at least have to be encouraged that Contreras still has a chance to return in the first half of the season.\n\nOf course, at 15-21 this season (worst in the NL Central), St. Louis could be too far out of playoff contention by then for it to matter. It will now be up to 23-year-old Ivan Herrera and 25-year-old Pedro Pages to hold down the fort at catcher in the meantime.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "darryn_albert@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Darryn Albert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ballpark_of_the_Palm_Beaches", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Ballpark of the Palm Beaches"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Palm_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MLB.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/willson-contreras.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548017", "eventUri": "eng-9548017", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Palm Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-03-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

However, after an unfortunate encounter on Tuesday, it appears as though his team may lose one of their top assets.\n\nDuring the Cardinals' game against the New York Mets on Tuesday, Mets slugger JD Martinez swung at an inside pitch. While Martinez' bat sailed wide of the ball, it clipped Contreras, who was crouched behind the plate, right on the wrist.\n\n\"Right now the benefits of framing a pitch seem worth the risk of getting hit by a swing. If we had roboumps today, Willson Contreras' arm wouldn't be fractured.\" - Sofie\n\nImmediately, the three-time All-Star collapsed, evidently in a great deal of pain. Clutching his arm, Contreras was escorted off of the field. His team would go on to fall to the New York Mets by a score of 7-5.\n\nFollowing the game, the Venezuelan catcher underwent tests that revealed a fracture in his left forearm. In the aftermath, the St. Louis Cardinals catcher revealed that he understood instantly that he had a serious ailment on his hands, telling The Athletic:\n\n\"I knew right away that i was in a bad situation\"\n\nA longtime member of the Chicago Cubs, Contreras was esteemed for his catching abilities, winning three All-Star nods and playing an integral role in delivering the 2016 World Series to Chicago. Prior to the 2023 season, the 31 year-old inked a five-year contract worth $87.5 million, meaning he will remain a Cardinal until at least 2027.\n\nNow expected to miss 6-8 weeks, Willson Contreras could have received far worse. JD Martinez is a former RBI leader who has clobbered 44 home runs since 2021. Replayed imagery of the exchange has renewed intense debate among observers regarding the practice of pitch-framing, and its related safety repurcussions.\n\nWillson Contreras will be a considerable loss for his team\n\nIn 31 games this season, Contreras has hit an impressive .280/.398/.551 with 11 doubles and 12 RBIs. Additionally, his 6 home runs and .949 lead his club. In response to the unfortunate injury sustained by his catcher, Cards manager Oli Marmol told USA Today:\n\n\"It's a tough one, (Contreras) was doing such a phenomenal job. He's a great competitor, he brings so much to the club, performance-wise but also his competitive nature. To see him go down was definitely tough.\"\n\nNow at last place in the NL Central, the Cardinals know that offensive production as at a premium.

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back of the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis Manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals Manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland Manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher's interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,\" Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams' glove earlier this season.\n\n\"Every hitter in the league has a different path. And it's also a little bit about trying to understand which hitter is the guy that gets the barrel in the zone further back,\" Adams said. \"So you've just got to find that balance between getting too close versus being so far away that you make those pitches at the bottom of the zone look a lot lower.\"\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras, right, is helped off the field by trainer Adam Olsen, left, after being injured during the second inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in St. Louis.

The club didn't provide an immediate recovery timeline, but he's obviously in for a lengthy absence.\n\nContreras suffered the injury in tonight's game against the Mets. He took a direct hit on a J.D. Martinez swing as he went to receive a Miles Mikolas offering (video provided on X by MLB.com's John Denton). Contreras was in obvious pain immediately and testing quickly revealed the broken bone. Contreras told reporters after the game that he'll undergo surgery and expects to miss six to eight weeks (X link via Denton). Contreras is shooting for a return around the All-Star Break.\n\nIn a lineup where almost everyone has underperformed, Contreras has been the Cardinals' bright spot. He's hitting .280/.398/.551 through 128 plate appearances. Among catchers with 100+ plate appearances, only Ryan Jeffers has been narrowly better by measure of wRC+. Contreras has also been by far the best player in the St. Louis lineup, handily leading the team in on-base percentage, slugging and home runs.\n\nYoung backstop Iv\u00e1n Herrera will step into the primary catching job. The former top prospect is hitting .215/.264/.369 over 72 trips to the plate. Pedro Pages is the only other catcher on the 40-man roster. Derrick Goold of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch tweets that Pages was pulled midway through his game in Triple-A, suggesting he'll be recalled tomorrow.\n\nContreras is in the second season of a five-year free agent deal.

Martinez was involved in a scary scene Tuesday night when his swing fractured the arm of St. Louis Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras.\n\nMartinez, now a member of the New York Mets, was at the plate in the second inning when he swung at a pitch. But instead of hitting the ball, Martinez's bat caught the left arm of Contreras behind the plate.\n\nWillson's cry of pain could be heard on the TV broadcast as the two-time All-Star catcher clutched his arm. The play was ruled as catcher interference, which awarded Martinez first base. Video of the incident can be seen here.\n\n\"So right now I mean, I'm in pain pretty good, but I'm really upset missing,\" Contreras said. \"I know that it's going to be tough for me to watch the games and not out there with the guys, but I'm going to do my best to stay present, pick each other up and cheer for them because that's the best thing I can do.\"\n\nAfter the game, Martinez told reporters that he felt terrible about the play.\n\n\"I hit meat,\" Martinez said, via the Associated Press. \"I felt like I hit meat. I didn't hit like just like a glove where you kind of just point back to catcher, it was just solid. I was like, dude, I hit him good. ... I felt terrible.\"\n\nContreras left the game after the play, with Iv\u00e1n Herrera taking over at catcher. After the game, the team announced that Contreras had a left forearm fracture.\n\n\"So right now I mean, I'm in pain pretty good, but I'm really upset missing,\" Contreras said, via the AP. \"I know that it's going to be tough for me to watch the games and not out there with the guys, but I'm going to do my best to stay present, pick each other up and cheer for them because that's the best thing I can do.\"\n\nHaving a batter's swing make contact with a catcher is not uncommon. However, catcher interference plays typically involve the batter clipping the mitt. It's rare for a batter's swing to strike the arm with full contact.\n\nThere were multiple reports that Cardinals coaches had told Contreras to move closer to the plate in an effort to better frame pitches. Meanwhile, Martinez is known to stand toward the very back of the batter's box.\n\n\"He's close to the plate trying to steal strikes,\" St. Louis starter Miles Mikolas said to reporters, via the AP. \"You know, as pitchers we appreciate that, but you know, if we knew he was going to get hurt, I'd rather throw all balls.\"\n\nMartinez played five seasons with the Red Sox, making four All-Star teams and winning a championship in 2018.

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It\u00b4s hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he\u00b4ll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone - and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It\u00b4s a huge risk, and it\u00b4s been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they\u00b4re getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras, left, is helped off the field by trainer Adam Olsen, right, after being injured during the second inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in St. Louis. Contreras left the game. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez\u00b4s swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I\u00b4ve never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn\u00b4t go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it\u00b4s devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee - which includes six owners, four players and one umpire - as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n\"We\u00b4re lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher\u00b4s interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,\" Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams\u00b4 glove earlier this season.\n\n\"Every hitter in the league has a different path. And it\u00b4s also a little bit about trying to understand which hitter is the guy that gets the barrel in the zone further back,\" Adams said. \"So you've just got to find that balance between getting too close versus being so far away that you make those pitches at the bottom of the zone look a lot lower.\"\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley, AP Sports Writers Ben Nuckols and Dan Gelston, and AP freelance reporters David Smale, Warren Mayes and Larry Fleisher contributed to this report.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras, right, is helped off the field by trainer Adam Olsen, left, after being injured during the second inning of a baseball game against the New York Mets Tuesday, May 7, 2024, in St. Louis.

Martinez's bat came crashing into Willson Contreras's left forearm.\n\nThe team announced that Contreras suffered a fracture of the forearm, creating an enormous hole in the heart of the lineup and sidelining far and away their most productive offensive player for an extended period.\n\nIv\u00e1n Herrera replaced Contreras in Tuesday night's game and will take over as the starting catcher for the time being, and rookie Pedro Pag\u00e9s was removed from Triple-A Memphis's game to allow for his recall in order to serve as Herrera's backup.\n\nIn Herrera and Pag\u00e9s, the Cardinals will be turning over catching responsibilities to two players with a combined 31 starts behind the plate in the big leagues, all of which belong to Herrera. But whatever impact Contreras has had behind the plate - his defensive output, particularly his pitch framing, has been dramatically improved - he far exceeds at the plate.\n\nHerrera did turn in strong offense early in the season, driving three home runs. For a brief period, Pag\u00e9s was added to the roster as a third catcher in order to provide more opportunities for Herrera to act as a pinch hitter or designated hitter.\n\nSince April 19, though, Herrera is 3-for-25 with one double and two runs batted in. The double and the RBI came Monday in the first game of this series against the Mets, tying the game in the bottom of the sixth inning. The Cardinals will need him to find his prior success, and quickly.\n\nContreras entered play Tuesday as the only player on the roster with an OPS above .800; he was also the only player above .900. He leads the team in home runs and doubles, and has been thrust into the second and third spots in the lineup in recent weeks as Paul Goldschmidt has continued to struggle.\n\nBy OPS+, Contreras, Nolan Arenado and Masyn Winn have been the only three Cardinals hitters this season to perform at league average or better. He is a vocal and passionate teammate, a leader on the field, and in many ways the central figure in the ways the team positioned itself this winter on both sides of the ball.\n\nIn his absence, the Cardinals will continue to rely on a stable veteran starting staff to guide the catchers in game planning and management, though the rotation also suffered a blow within the last week as Steven Matz was placed on the injured list with a strained back.\n\nEntering play Tuesday at a season-worst five games below .500, the level of urgency around the team has been at a peak. Through grinding and fighting for solutions at the plate, it has been Contreras's consistency which has acted as a lodestar, the one point of stability in a sea of turbulent performances.\n\nNow, for at least a period of weeks, that star has been extinguished.\n\nThe howls of pain from Contreras which were audible on the fourth level of Busch Stadium carried with them the sounds of concern and frustration from the dugout, as manager Oli Marmol squatted pensively with Contreras as he was treated by head trainer Adam Olsen.\n\nHis face was grim, set.

Contreras left the game.\n\nWhen catcher Willson Contreras of the St. Louis Cardinals was struck on his left arm by a swing Tuesday night, it was felt by former and current backstops all over the big leagues. Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher's interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,\" Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams' glove earlier this season.\n\n\"Every hitter in the league has a different path. And it's also a little bit about trying to understand which hitter is the guy that gets the barrel in the zone further back,\" Adams said. \"So you've just got to find that balance between getting too close versus being so far away that you make those pitches at the bottom of the zone look a lot lower.\"\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley, AP Sports Writers Ben Nuckols and Dan Gelston, and AP freelance reporters David Smale, Warren Mayes and Larry Fleisher contributed to this report.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_cohen@ktbs.com", "name": "Jay Cohen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bochy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Bochy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salvador P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

LOUIS -- In a conversation before the St. Louis Cardinals' most recent homestand, hitting coach Turner Ward spoke about the importance of his hitters being selectively aggressive during at-bats.\n\nThe Cardinals haven't been. They entered play Monday with the lowest OPS (.625) in the National League. The Cardinals have been unable to do damage on pitches in the zone, leading to one of their worst offensive starts to a season in recent memory. It's what Ward believes is the biggest issue for the offense.\n\n\"With us moving forward, it's about how we can be in a position as an offense to be ready to swing at pitches we can do damage on,\" Ward said in a recent interview with The Athletic. \"A really great swing, with a chase, is not productive.\"\n\nFast forward to Monday afternoon, fresh off the Cardinals' most disappointing weekend of 2024 after losing the series to the Chicago White Sox, and manager Oli Marmol delivered the same analysis.\n\n\"Being more aggressive on pitches in the zone would be something that sticks out to me,\" Marmol said a few hours before a 4-3 loss to the New York Mets. \"When it comes to overall damage, pulling the ball in the air. ... That's where damage is done. We haven't done enough of that, but that goes hand in hand with swinging at pitches you can do that with.\"\n\nThe heart of the Cardinals' order certainly agrees. When St. Louis constructed its roster over the offseason, it did so under the impression that Paul Goldschmidt, Nolan Arenado and Willson Contreras would hit for power -- as their lengthy track records would suggest. Yet as the season approaches the six-week mark, only Contreras has performed up to expectation.\n\nLet's look at what the metrics say about the Cardinals' heavy hitters.\n\nContreras leads the team with six homers and a .932 OPS. He's been the only consistent presence in the lineup. After spending most of last season hitting fifth in the order, Marmol bumped Contreras to the two-hole -- usually reserved for the team's overall best hitter -- at the end of April.\n\nWard and his staff have emphasized being selectively aggressive, and Contreras has done a nice job of incorporating that discipline. His 14.6 percent walk rate ranks in baseball's 93rd percentile and is a good indication of how well he's seeing the ball. Another is his spray chart. When Contreras is locked in at the plate, he'll often showcase his power by staying through the baseball and slugging the ball to right-center. Four of his home runs this year have been to either center field or to the opposite field, and his chart shows a heavy mix of balls hit to all fields.\n\nStill, an offense can't simply be propelled by one player. It's certainly felt that way for Contreras this season though.\n\nFor as encouraging as Contreras has looked, Goldschmidt has been the polar opposite. Slight regression from his 2022 National League MVP year could have been expected in 2023 and heading into this season, but surely no one could predict Goldschmidt hitting at a .203/.297/.273 clip.\n\nGoldschmidt has always had exceptional bat-to-ball skills. But his numbers have nosedived. His metrics are down across the board, including average exit velocity (90.6 mph), barrel percentage (4.9 percent) and hard-hit percentage (43.2 percent). The most concerning area for Goldschmidt however is his strikeout rate.\n\nGoldschmidt is striking out 30 percent of the time, a perplexing development for a player who has built a career by being selective at the plate. What's even more concerning? His struggles against sliders. Opposing pitchers are throwing sliders to Goldschmidt nearly 20 percent of the time. Goldschmidt is whiffing on them 44 percent of the time. When players are close to coming out of a slump, many will acknowledge the quality of their at-bats improving, even if the on-field results aren't following suit. In Goldschmidt's case, the at-bats have looked more or less the same all season. That's the real cause for concern.\n\nArenado's .286 average is par for the course and he's driven in a team-high 19 runs. It's his slugging numbers that are raising red flags. After 35 games, Arenado has just two homers and his slugging percentage has dropped to .391 -- far from his career mark of .525. Arenado has been candid about his feel at the plate. From a mechanics standpoint, he hasn't felt right all season. His lack of power backs that up.\n\nLargely regarded as one of the best pull-side power hitters in the game, Arenado is posting batted ball data that looks borderline unrecognizable. His average exit velocity is just above 85 mph. He's barreled two balls all season. It's less about discipline for Arenado, who is still working walks and finding ways to get on base. It's more about his inability to do damage on the pitches he wants, an alarming new trend.\n\nThe Cardinals' logic was sound when they identified their three power bats to once more charge the offense.

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels.

Martinez was at the plate for the New York Mets when he swung at an 85 mph breaking ball from Miles Mikolas.\n\nIn his swing, though, Martinez's bat hit Contreras near the wrist, and judging by Contreras' reaction, it was clear that something was seriously wrong.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nContreras rolled around in pain behind the plate, but when he stood up holding his arm, he began screaming in pain.\n\nManager Oliver Marmol and a trainer came out to check on him, but it was obvious he would not be staying in the game.\n\n\"It was numb, and I knew it wasn't right. Once I tried to do some motion stuff, there was some cracking in [the arm] and I knew it was bad,\" he said after the game.\n\n\"So right now I mean, I'm in pain pretty good, but I'm really upset missing. I know that it's going to be tough for me to watch the games and not out there with the guys, but I'm going to do my best to stay present, pick each other up and cheer for them because that's the best thing I can do.\"\n\nSTEPHEN A.

I didn't hit like just like a glove where you kind of just point back to catcher, it was just solid. I was like, dude, I hit him good. ... I felt terrible.\"\n\nMLB.com notes that Contreras has been setting up closer to the batter behind the plate to improve his defense - while a good strategy for framing pitches, it ultimately comes with quite a cost.\n\n\"It's a huge risk, and it was talked about in the offseason and a topic in discussion because there were more [catcher's interference calls], because they are evaluated on framing,\" Marmol said. \"The closer they're able to get to the hitter to get that low pitch, it's definitely a topic of conversation. The risk is high, and we just experienced it.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, Martinez was awarded first base.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nContreras had doubled in the first inning, when St. Louis scored three runs, but the Mets eventually won, 7-5.\n\nHe is hitting .280 with six homers and 12 RBIs.

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate through the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven each, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher's interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,\" Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams' glove earlier this season.\n\n\"Every hitter in the league has a different path.

Hitters are scratching back to buy themselves an infinitesimal amount of extra time to recognize a pitch, and catchers are reaching forward to frame strikes nearer the plate.\n\nIt was there Tuesday, in that sliver of space and time, where pitches can be won and so can games, that Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras extended his mitt and Mets designated hitter J.D. Martinez uncoiled his swing.\n\nBat met bone and the Cardinals season painfully changed.\n\nIn the second inning, Martinez's swing crashed into Contreras' left forearm and drove through to his wrist, fracturing at least one bone as it went. Contreras screamed in pain, wheeled toward the Cardinals' dugout, and eventually surrendered to the ground. He left the game and started what will be months of recovery from a fractured forearm. Contreras stood at his Busch Stadium locker late Tuesday night after the 7-5 loss to the New York Mets with his arm in a splint and a sling, and he explained that surgery is a possibility in the coming days to stabilize the arm and aid healing.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Busch Stadium needs renovations.

I knew it wasn't right. I was trying to recover to see if I could catch. But once I turned, I did some motion. I felt some cracking in it. I knew it was bad.\"\n\nA question facing Major League Baseball is if it will be worse.\n\nA topic of discussion within the industry is the dramatic increase in catcher interference calls just like Contreras' on Tuesday. Chasing an old practice of framing pitches but empowered by new metrics that precisely measure that skill, catchers throughout the majors are creeping closer and closer to the plate. Contreras worked with the Cardinals during the spring of 2023 to position himself closer to that plate than he had been with the Cubs for the express purpose of improving the calls he got on lower pitches. Many catchers and teams are doing it for an obvious reason. It works. It pays off. But it's not without risk.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" manager Oliver Marmol conceded Tuesday night. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nSaid Contreras: \"I think the best way to frame is to get closer.\"\n\nIt does not take long to search for the leaders in all of the latest or greatest stats - from baseball card standards like batting average and homers to the modern metric alphabet soup of xwOBA, OPS+, DRS, BABIP, wRC, or ISO. But try finding catcher interference. It's not a common column on any of the stat sites. It's not even all that well known of an event. The batter gets first base. The catcher gets an error, right there on the scoreboard. But it happens so rarely, why track?\n\nOr, rather it did.\n\nAs recently as 2002 there were fewer than 10 catcher interference calls in the majors. From 2012 to 2014, the yearly total did not surpass 25. There were 26 catcher interference calls this past April alone. Back in 2015, there were 33 catcher interference calls total in the season. Contreras' was the 33rd of this season. In the span of just five years, the number of catcher interference calls in the majors has doubled, and in 2022 a new record was set with 74. That high was surpassed in 2023 - more specifically, in August of 2023, on the way to 96.\n\nThe increase parallels improved framing metrics, wider access, and, yes, salaries.\n\n\"He's close to the plate trying to steal strikes (and) as pitchers we appreciate that,\" starter Miles Mikolas said. \"If we knew he was going to get hurt I'd rather throw a ball than have Willy get hurt. ... I don't think any amount of strikes is worth a player's health. Guys are getting paid and going up and down (to the minors) based on their framing metrics. The closer you can get, the better the framing metrics you can get. We've kind of forced these guys to scooch up as far as they can so they can steal low strikes and give the umpires a better view.\"\n\nOut of the game after pitching into the fifth inning and allowing six runs in the fifth inning, Mikolas said he thought about a solution.\n\nDraw a line for safety.\n\nWiden the gap and erase the encroaching reward from metrics.\n\n\"I think there should be a line back there for the catchers and just have them stay behind the line,\" Mikolas said. \"That way no one can get any closer than the next guy, and if you put them back there in a spot that is deemed safe that might help guys.\"\n\nThis year the Cardinals' batters have swung into three catcher interference calls. Paul Goldschmidt has two of them. San Diego has the most with four. In 2023, the teams that committed the most catcher interference violations had seven. Two hitters, Oakland's Esteury Ruiz and Houston's Kyle Tucker, swung into seven. A game between the Brewers and Dodgers this past fall was decided, in part, by two catcher interference calls.\n\nThe catcher? Willson's younger brother, William Contreras, who helped his older brother this offseason to shift where he starts his mitt and his angles to better frame.\n\nAnd the hitter? Martinez.\n\n\"It's the last thing you're expecting to happen,\" said Martinez, the Mets' new designated hitter, after Tuesday's game in the visiting clubhouse at Busch. \"You're expecting to hit a ball and you hit an arm. And you're like, 'What was that?' I hit meat. I felt I hit meat. I didn't hit just a glove where you kind of just point back at the catcher. ... It was just solid. I got to first. I felt terrible.\"\n\nA freezeframe of the at-bat before Mikolas attempted to wedge a slider in on Martinez shows just how close the catcher and hitter are.\n\nThe back line of the batter's box vanishes in the first inning.\n\nCatchers can lobby the umpire to notice if the batter's a bit farther back, but as Contreras said any trace of white chalk around the cleat is going to keep the batter in place.\n\nMeanwhile, the catcher is trying to get that glove-side angle to get the low, inside call. He wants to get the low pitches called strike, and he's getting closer to the plate because he's not just fighting the umpire's view. Gravity has a say, too.\n\nThe space between Contreras and Martinez vanishes fast.\n\n\"He saw the pitch really late and tried to get his emergency swing off and that's when he hit me,\" Contreras said. \"I think if he sees the pitch well, he would try to hit it out in front and he wouldn't hit me. I'm not blaming him. He's doing his thing. As a catcher and I'm trying to get good framing (numbers), I have to risk something. It was really bad tonight. ... I happened to get hit in my arm and break it. Hopefully it doesn't' happen again to another catcher because it's not fun.\"\n\nBut before that moment, Contreras' approach had been fruitful.\n\nSetting up nearer the plate did not immediately improve his framing of the low strike for 2023, but coupled with changes to his mitt positioning, his use of a one-knee-down stance, and other adjustments, it has for 2024. He ranked outside the top 30 for catchers on converting the low, glove-side edge pitch into a strike before this season. This year, he's got the sixth highest percentage, at 41.9%. He's improved in all three areas of the low strike zone. Which is why he said he's going to go back to the same spot when he returns.\n\n\"There is always a risk to being a catcher,\" Contreras said. \"It could be different on my knee or getting hit in the head with my concussion. The risk is always going to be there. I'm not blaming any part of my game because this happened tonight. When I get back, I'm going to try to be the same guy behind the plate and keep doing my best.\"\n\nThe 23-year-old catcher taking over for Contreras as the Cardinals' every day starter echoed the veteran who has been a mentor as he, too, tries to improve his framing.\n\n\"There's always a risk in anything,\" Ivan Herrera said. \"You can get a foul into the wrist. We're trying to get strikes for the pitcher and get in the best position. It happened to Willson today. It could happen to me, too.\"\n\nAfter Contreras got up from his seated position near the on-deck circle - his left arm stabilized in the grip of the Cardinals' head athletic trainer - Herrera took over behind the plate. He had two singles and somewhere in between calling pitches and hitting them, he got back to the clubhouse to check on Contreras.\n\nContreras told him about the fracture.\n\nHerrera's head dropped.\n\n\"You don't need to put your head down; you need to pick me up,\" Contreras recalled telling the rookie. \"It's not that he needs to, but he's going to. Because he's really good.\"\n\n0 Comments Tags Pro-baseball St. Louis Cardinals Cardinals Derrick Goold Major League Baseball Mlb Willson Contreras Ivan Herrra New York Mets Mets J.d.

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher's interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,\" Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams' glove earlier this season.\n\n\"Every hitter in the league has a different path. And it's also a little bit about trying to understand which hitter is the guy that gets the barrel in the zone further back,\" Adams said. \"So you've just got to find that balance between getting too close versus being so far away that you make those pitches at the bottom of the zone look a lot lower.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley, AP Sports Writers Ben Nuckols and Dan Gelston, and AP freelance reporters David Smale, Warren Mayes and Larry Fleisher contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bochy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Bochy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salvador P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n\"It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,\" said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.\"\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.\"\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n\"MLB addressed it in spring training with us,\" Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, \"in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.\"\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n\"We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,\" said Bochy, a former big league catcher. \"That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.\"\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n\"We're lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher's interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,\" Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams' glove earlier this season.\n\n\"Every hitter in the league has a different path. And it's also a little bit about trying to understand which hitter is the guy that gets the barrel in the zone further back,\" Adams said. \"So you've just got to find that balance between getting too close versus being so far away that you make those pitches at the bottom of the zone look a lot lower.\"\n\nAP Baseball Writer Janie McCauley, AP Sports Writers Ben Nuckols and Dan Gelston, and AP freelance reporters David Smale, Warren Mayes and Larry Fleisher contributed to this report.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

The rate at which the bats of opposing hitters were rising rapidly. Catcher's interference was called 94 times in 2023, nearly 20 more times than in 2022.\n\nWhat was causing the dramatic uptick? Catchers kept moving closer to the plate. In the era of pitch framing, teams deduced that the closer a catcher is to receiving a pitch, the better chance he has to \"steal\" a strike.\n\nIt worked well enough that catchers kept shifting closer to the batter's box. The memo this spring essentially warned teams to cut it out and move catchers farther behind the plate to minimize risk.\n\nBut anyone who saw St. Louis Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras sustain a fractured left arm Tuesday night knows that risk remains ever-present.\n\nCatcher's interference calls continue to skyrocket at a historic pace. The average catcher's interference total from 2010 to 2018 was 31. This year, it's been called 33 times -- less than two months in.\n\nMLB's concerns were already growing. There are more than double the interferences in 2024 compared to the 2022 season at the same point (15). The league is on pace for a record 148 catchers interferences this season. The push to frame the lower strike has inadvertently put the safety of catchers in jeopardy.\n\n\"The risk is high,\" Cardinals manager Oli Marmol said earlier in the week. \"We just experienced it.\"\n\nContreras was struck flush by the swing of New York Mets' designated hitter J.D. Martinez. The catcher underwent surgery on Wednesday and will miss a minimum of six to eight weeks. Contreras was one of baseball's worst framers last year on borderline pitches below the zone. The Cardinals, a defense-oriented club, worked extensively with Contreras to improve in that regard.\n\nOver his first year in St. Louis, the Cardinals overhauled Contreras' approach, including his set-up behind the plate (Contreras ditched the traditional crouch behind the plate in favor of the one-knee down method). They also did indeed move Contreras closer to the plate.\n\nThe Cardinals are hardly the only team in baseball to deploy this method, but they were the first to pay the price for it this season.\n\n\"The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter in order to get to that low pitch,\" Marmol said. \"You're seeing more catchers do that based on being able to get the low pitch, but you're also seeing more catcher's interference and backswings getting guys based on them being closer. Sometimes the catcher unknowingly could get closer and closer from hitter to hitter without noticing.\"\n\nThat seems to have been the case for Contreras, who was caught by the swing of Martinez, who has a naturally deep swing and sets up as close to the back of the batter's box as possible. Replays showed the head of Martinez's bat hitting Contreras' left arm square. It also showed just how far Contreras had reached in his attempt to frame the pitch.\n\n\"There's always a risk being a catcher,\" Contreras said after the injury. \"Could have been something different. It could've been off my knee, it could be a concussion. That risk is always going to be there. I'm not blaming any part of my game because this happened tonight.\"\n\nPerhaps that's the problem. No position player in baseball takes a more constant beating than the catcher. And as teams across the board covet the low-strike call, catchers take the brunt of the consequences.\n\n\"We used to always talk about catcher interference being long strings on your glove or ticking your glove,\" Detroit Tigers manager A.J. Hinch, who caught seven seasons in the big leagues said. \"Then it turned into the glove in its entirety. (Contreras) is one of the first I've seen on a limb.\"\n\n\"That is risky,\" Hinch added. \"The closer we get to the plate the more strikes we can grab at the bottom rail. Catchers are getting evaluated. They're getting paid on how well they can control the bottom rail. That's led to more and more catcher interferences throughout the game. ... We do want our guys close enough to be impactful with the low strike but not walking into harm's way. It's a tough balance when the incentive to do it is real and the risk is extreme.\"\n\nSome teams stress the low strike more than others. Philadelphia Phillies manager Rob Thomson was a catcher in the Tigers organization for four seasons. He was taught that as the bat comes through the zone, the glove should follow.\n\n\"You're going to catch more foul tips,\" Thomson said. \"You're closer to the plate, you're closer to the strike zone. It's a better presentation for the umpire.\"\n\nStill, Thomson prefers his catchers keep some distance from the plate.\n\n'\"We keep our eye on guys that do that and remind the catcher, 'You got to back up a little bit,'\" he said.\n\nThe happy medium for some teams seems to be self-monitoring. The Minnesota Twins, for example, monitor their catcher every pitch. It's one of the primary in-game responsibilities of first-base and catching coach Hank Conger.\n\n\"A good, tight setup generally speaking is better than worse, something you prefer. But it's obviously to avoid not just catcher interference, but injuries, too,\" manager Rocco Baldelli said. \"I think there's a few reasons why (being closer) is helpful, but there are other times that we're yelling at them to back the hell up to also be helpful, you know?\"\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have two coaches assigned to catching duties. Sal Fasano is the catching coach. He's assisted by Eddie P\u00e9rez, who spent nine of his 11 big-league seasons catching for the Braves. P\u00e9rez certainly understands the strategy behind being close to the plate but thinks the responsibility to inform the catcher he's too close falls on those watching the game from the dugout.\n\n\"It's always a good idea to be closer to the hitter,\" P\u00e9rez said. \"It's thought that if you're closer to the hitter, you're going to get more calls.\"\n\n\"Sal always reminds them to go back, you don't want to get hurt,\" P\u00e9rez added. \"From (the dugout) you see better. When you're catching you don't know how far you are from the hitter, and every hitter has a different setup, so you have to adjust. ... As a catcher, they've got to tell you from the side how close you are to the hitter.\"\n\nBut the accidental blows behind the plate can sometimes be a two-way street. Catchers are frequently clipped by hitters' swings regardless of where they're positioned. With the average bat speed registering roughly 75 mph, some argue the responsibility lies on the batter to ensure not just their physical body remains within the parameters of the batter's box, but their swing as well.\n\n\"The thing I don't necessarily agree with is it can be the way people are swinging, too,\" Chicago Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. \"It can be the way catchers are setting up, yes. But it also can be kind of the way some people are swinging. And it's dangerous.\"\n\nWith the league on notice and MLB clearly aware of the risks, what can be done to cut down catcher's interference -- and the inherent injury risk? Cardinals' starting pitcher Miles Mikolas suggested a physical line behind the plate that catchers cannot cross, a box of their own in a way. Could the automated ball-strike system (which theoretically eliminates the value of framing) be the answer? Possibly, but it's an imperfect system in the minor leagues and is far from being a big-league product.\n\n\"I don't know what they could possibly do other than reward the hitter with more bases, put him on second base,\" Hinch said. \"There are things you could probably do to make it super impactful to the game, but I don't know if anything can be more impactful than losing one of your best players for six to eight weeks, 10 weeks, whatever it's gonna be.\"\n\nThe Cardinals now know how severe that impact can be.

Also, no team has more quality outfield options than Milwaukee.\n\nThe Cardinals wish they could say the same . . .\n\nTALKIN' BASEBALL\n\nHere is what folks are writing about Our National Pastime:\n\nDavid Roth, The Defector: \"His time in St. Louis has been fraught, coinciding as it did with the moment that The Cardinals Thing finally seemed to stop working. (Willson) Contreras has also been the team's best all-around player more or less from the moment he arrived, and if you took every catcher in both leagues and graded them out on hitting, power, arm strength, defense, ability to block the baseball, speed, all the different attributes that a player has, and were honest, Contreras has remained one of the very best in the sport. This made it stranger when, by May of last year, seemingly everyone on the Cardinals, from the front office to the manager to the various meatball heroes on the pitching staff, had seemingly settled on Contreras as a scapegoat. Contreras got better, and finished with numbers right around his career norms, but the team stayed salty and bad. After rebuilding the rotation around soft-tossing veterans with various levels of Police Energy in the offseason, the Cardinals have been roughly as inert as they were last year. Only some of this can be blamed on the grimacing 30-somethings in the rotation; the bigger issue has been that basically every hitter in the Cardinals lineup has struggled all season long. At the moment when a J.D. Martinez swing broke Contreras's arm as he reached for a pitch on Tuesday night, Contreras led the Cardinals in every offensive category except batting average, and his .949 OPS was more than 200 points higher than anyone else on the team. They're in last place, and Contreras is going to be out until the All-Star break.\"\n\nAlex Stumpf, MLB.com: \"The wait for Paul Skenes is finally over. The Pirates announced on Wednesday that they are promoting their top prospect to the Majors. Skenes, a fireballing right-hander, is scheduled to make his first start on Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park (4:05 p.m. ET), according to the club. Skenes was the first overall pick in last year's Draft and is currently ranked as the No. 3 prospect, and top pitcher, in the game by MLB Pipeline. The 6-foot-6 Skenes burst onto the national scene last year with Louisiana State University, being named the Division I National Player of the Year and leading his school to the College World Series title. Armed with a fastball that consistently registers in the triple digits and a wipeout slider, Skenes certainly lived up to the hype during his time in the Minors this year, where he recorded a 0.99 ERA and 45 strikeouts over 27 1/3 innings with Triple-A Indianapolis. He has also developed his pitch repertoire in his time as a professional, mixing in his changeup, curveball and 'splinker' (a sinker-splitter hybrid) more, adding additional weapons to his arsenal.\"\n\nMatt Snyder, CBSSports.com: \"The Houston Astros got stomped on Tuesday night, 10-3, by the New York Yankees with future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander getting hammered for seven runs on eight hits in five innings. Given how the 2024 season has gone for the Astros, it wasn't entirely shocking. The loss dropped them to 12-23, good for last place in the AL West -- a division that includes a team that lost 112 games last season and one that lost Shohei Ohtani in the offseason (and Mike Trout during this season). In fact, the only teams that have a worse record in all of baseball are the utter dregs: the White Sox, Rockies and Marlins. The Marlins already sold off a key piece with the trade of Luis Arraez to the Padres. As they are both on pace to lose 120+ games (for real), we can expect both the Rockies and White Sox to be sellers this season as well. The Astros, meanwhile, are on pace right now to finish 56-106. If that sounds familiar, that was the Astros' record in 2011, the first of three straight pitiful seasons before the tide started to turn for the franchise.\"\n\nJustin Klugh, Baseball Reference: \"The grounder. As far as outcomes go, it lives somewhere above striking out swinging and striking out swinging while falling down. Among the batted balls, it is scoffed at by long flies and sneered at by liners. Sure, some grounders skip and bounce and sizzle down the line past the outreached glove of a corner infielder. Others shoot up the middle after the pitcher barely avoids a mangled shin. But for the most part, they are not a desired result. In fact, they're considered a downright problem when a guy is hitting too many of them. And the Marlins are the best at hitting them! Nobody in baseball is better at hitting ground balls than the Marlins -- as a team, over half their batted balls have stayed on the ground (51.8%). No other team in Major League Baseball does that more than 46% of the time. Because of this frequent occurrence, the Marlins also lead the National League in grounding into double plays (39) and in their groundball to fly ball ratio (1.73).\"\n\nMEGAPHONE\n\n\"I know it's not gonna be easy to do that every night, but we're really capable of doing that and more. Judge has been locked in the last couple of days. I'm really excited for that -- I can't wait to see him going crazy. It's gonna be great. And G, how hard he hits the ball, it's just amazing. You don't see guys hitting balls 120 every day.\"\n\nYankees slugger Juan Soto, after he, Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton all went deep in the same game.\n\n0 Comments", "source": {"uri":

Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nWhen catcher Willson Contreras of the St. Louis Cardinals was struck on his left arm by a swing Tuesday night, it was felt by former and current backstops all over the big leagues. Everyone from Salvador Perez in Kansas City to managers like Bruce Bochy and Rob Thomson.\n\nIt was especially painful for his Contreras' brother, William.\n\n''It's hard for me, too, because I love my brother. He plays every day. But he'll be back,'' said William Contreras, a catcher with the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nWillson Contreras' broken left forearm was a scary reminder of the increasing danger for catchers who have moved closer to home plate over the years in an effort to steal strike calls at the bottom of the zone -- and sometimes even lower.\n\nWhen a hitter with a long swing stands at the back at the batter's box, there is precious little room to maneuver.\n\n''The risk is high. We just experienced it,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday. \"It's a huge risk, and it's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic of discussion because there was an increase in them. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the closer they're getting to the hitter to get that low pitch.''\n\nContreras got hurt with New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez at the plate in the second inning. After he was hit by Martinez's swing, the three-time All-Star tumbled over in obvious pain. He is expected to be sidelined at least six weeks following surgery for a fractured forearm.\n\n''I've never seen anything like that,\" said Royals manager Matt Quatraro, who caught in college and the minor leagues. \"I feel terribly for him. I didn't go back and watch it in super slow motion, but it's devastating for him.''\n\nMartinez was awarded first base on one of 33 catcher interference calls through Tuesday's games, a slight increase from 30 at the same point last year, according to Sportradar. There were 96 catcher interference calls during the 2023 season, up from 74 the previous year and the majors' highest total since at least 1974.\n\nThe increase has attracted the attention of Major League Baseball, which has held conversations with teams about the calls and positioning by catchers.\n\n''MLB addressed it in spring training with us,'' Oakland manager Mark Kotsay said, ''in terms of talking about it with our catchers and making them aware that the catcher injury has increased over the last two years, especially with concussions and being hit in the head. So there's definitely a fine line.''\n\nContreras has been one of St. Louis' best hitters this season, so it's a costly injury for the Cardinals. Bochy, the Texas manager, said that risk has affected how the Rangers position their catchers.\n\n''We back them off just a hair, because, I tell you, the last thing you want to do is not just get hit in an arm, but maybe in the back of the head,'' said Bochy, a former big league catcher. ''That's how close they're getting, especially when the ball's low.''\n\nIf the plays continue, Major League Baseball could bring the trend to its competition committee -- which includes six owners, four players and one umpire -- as part of its process for addressing safety concerns.\n\nIn the meantime, players and teams are identifying the hitters who put their catchers at increased risk.\n\nOakland outfielder Esteury Ruiz and Houston slugger Kyle Tucker drew the most catcher interference calls in 2023 with seven apiece, two more than White Sox outfielder Luis Robert Jr. and Shohei Ohtani in his final season with the Angels. Padres infielder Jake Cronenworth has drawn three such calls already this year.\n\n''We're lucky enough to have good analytics on what guys are high risk of catcher's interference, so it gives us kind of the depth piece to be able to move back or move forward on guys,'' Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.\n\nNationals catcher Riley Adams said he makes notes of hitters whose swing paths could put him in danger. One is Ohtani, who nicked Adams' glove earlier this season.\n\n''Every hitter in the league has a different path. And it's also a little bit about trying to understand which hitter is the guy that gets the barrel in the zone further back,'' Adams said.

He's counting on 23-year-old Ivan Herrera to step up in the starting role until Contreras' return.\n\nContreras exited the Cardinals' 7-5 loss to the New York Mets on May 7 with a fractured forearm after being hit by a J.D. Martinez swing. That leaves Herrera to fill the void.\n\nHerrera, who has three home runs and 11 RBI in just 69 at-bats this year, has filled in adequately for the Redbirds thus far. Now, he'll be asked to take the place of a former three-time All-Star. The young backstop is more than adequate at the plate, but it's his work behind the dish that the team may have some concerns about.\n\nOn the season, Herrera has not thrown out a single base stealer in 17 attempts, prompting some to wonder how much that will affect the struggling Cardinals in Contreras' absence.\n\nDespite his lack of early success, Marmol believes that Herrera will fare better as he gets more time behind the plate. The Redbird manager insists that certain exercises and techniques could help the youngster improve his throwing.\n\n\"There's arm-strengthening stuff, as far as just being able to get on a long-toss program and actually gain something there,\" Marmol said according to Benjamin Hochman of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. \"But his footwork, exchange, and being able to consistently throw and give himself the best shot on the right side of the bag is what he's working on. A lot of his misses are on that side. And that's something that's technical -- you can improve that.\"\n\n\"I've actually seen the most growth in his preparation,\" Marmol said. \"He receives well, he's continuing to work on his blocking and throwing, but the biggest improvement has been in how he's preparing for the game. And that's allowed him to slow the game down while he's calling it and kind of navigating a lineup and working with the pitcher.\"\n\nWhile St. Louis doesn't expect Herrera to be a dazzling defensive star overnight, Marnol says that it's imperative that he isn't a liability at catcher, either.\n\n\"It's very important,\" the Redbird skipper stated. \"I mean - depending on who you're playing - there are some teams that run a lot more than others, and you have to defend against that no different than when you make a defensive replacement in center field.\"\n\n\"If you have a catcher whose strength is that -- and while you're carrying three catchers, it's easier to do, because you still have protection -- you defend against it. And we were in a part of a lineup where I felt like (our opponent's) way of getting back into this game would be by taking the 90 feet. So we made the move and kept that from potentially happening.\"\n\nThe Cardinals began the year 15-21 through their 36 games and in last place in the National League Central. Marmol will look to get the most out of Herrera that he can in the six to eight weeks until Contreras returns to the lineup.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_boman@heavy.com", "name": "Ryan Boman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Marmol", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Marmol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

He tops the team in on-base percentage, slugging, and home runs.\n\nA three-time All-Star, Contreras has produced five 20-homer seasons. He had six this year before injury intervened.\n\nThe Venezuelan backstop, whose brother William has blossomed into an All- Star receiver with the Milwaukee Brewers, has a career batting average of .258, compiled during a nine-year career that began with the Chicago Cubs in 2016.\n\nContreras, 32 next week, is in the second season of a five-year, $75 million deal that makes him the highest-paid Cardinal after first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, whose five-year, $130 million deal ends this fall.\n\nThe St. Louis payroll of $175,479,118, which ranks 12th in the National League, seems generous in relation to team performance.\n\nSince losing catcher Yadier Molina, first baseman Albert Pujols, and pitcher Adam Wainwright to retirement, the Cardinals have struggled.\n\nEntering play Thursday, they continued to languish in the cellar of the Central Division, six games from the top with a record of 15-21.\n\nAn inability to win at home, where they are only 6-11, has been both a surprise and a disappointment.\n\nWith Contreras out, light-hitting rookie Ivan Herrera is expected to inherit the catching job - despite a .234 average in limited action. Another rookie, Pedro Pages, has been called up to serve as understudy for Herrera.\n\nFans continue to support the club - paid attendance at Busch Memorial Stadium last year ranked third in the NL at 3,241,091 - but are used to winning and could be getting restless.\n\nThe Cardinals have not won a pennant since 2013 or a World Series since 2011.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType":

Martinez Swing, Signifying Catcher Position Issues", "body": "Catchers have continued to creep closer and closer to the mound in 2024, and it finally resulted in a major, devastating injury.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals catcher Willson Contreras fractured his arm on a downswing by New York Mets designed hitter J.D. Martinez on Tuesday night, in a tough-to-watch, real world example of the dangers of pitch framing.\n\nNormally, catchers interference calls are a result of the hitter's bat nicking the catcher's glove. That's not what happened here. Martinez's downswing landed square on Contreras' forearm, with the Cardinals announcing that he suffered a \"left-arm fracture.\"\n\nAnd based on how catchers are being taught to set up, it could become a much more common problem.\n\nContreras is hardly an outlier; catcher's interference calls have skyrocketed in recent years, exploding up to 96 in 2023. Thus far in 2024, they're on pace to shatter previous records.\n\nAccording to Codify Baseball, there were 23 catcher's interference calls in 2014, just 10 years ago. This year through May 7, there's been 33. That pace would result in roughly 145-150 such calls in 2024.\n\nSo why is this happening?\n\nAcross Major League Baseball, catchers are being told to move closer to the plate in an attempt to steal more strikes, especially on low pitches. The thought being that umpires, being human, often call balls and strikes based on where the ball hits the glove, not where the pitch crosses the plate.\n\nMove closer to the plate and the glove catches the ball incrementally higher. In theory, that could steal a few strikes that would otherwise have been called balls. They've also been instructed to squat with one knee up and the other leg on the ground to improve receiving on lower pitches.\n\nWith the amount of data available to teams, they've become experts at identifying every possible advantage. Framing is one of the biggest, and maximizing it has immense benefits. Thus the explosion in catcher's interference calls.\n\nBut with Contreras set to miss a substantial period of time with a fractured forearm, will that force teams to rethink their strategies? Maybe. Contreras has exaggerated his positioning, but the concept behind it makes sense. Catcher's interference results in an automatic base, but teams clearly have determined that those risks are worth stealing, say, a few extra strikes per game.\n\nThough after seeing the Contreras video, it wouldn't be surprising to see catchers league wide move a few inches back.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_miller@outkick.com", "name": "Ian Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interference (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Herrera is set to take over as the Cardinals starting catching job while Contreras is out for an undetermined time.\n\n\"We have great people here that support each other, and I truly believe I can help this team win,\" Herrera said Tuesday night.\n\nWentzville superintendent's departure came after threats and police patrols Busch Stadium needs renovations.

Martinez's bat as the Mets slugger swung at a pitch. Contreras was set to go undergo surgery on his fractured left arm Wednesday, manager Oliver Marmol said.\n\nRookie catcher Pedro Pages was recalled Wednesday from Memphis with Contreras's placement on the 10-day injured list.\n\nThere is no timeline for when Contreras may return to play.\n\nThrough 24 games, Herrera is batting .232 with three home runs and a .653 OPS. He went two-for-four with two singles off the bench in the Cardinals' 7-5 loss Tuesday. The pair of singles made him five-for-15 in his last five games dating back to April 30. The recent production at the plate was preceded by a nine-game stretch during which he had one hit in 21 at-bats.\n\n\"I've been feeling good, man,\" Herrera said. \"There's nothing better than struggling and then coming back right out of it, right? I think that's when you know what kind of player and person you are: When you hit rock bottom. I've been struggling, but I come every day to the field grinding, and grinding. Hard work is always going to pay off. It's a long season.\"\n\nWhen looking at where Herrera has progressed since making his debut in 2022 when the Cardinals needed catching help because of injuries and inconsistencies, Marmol pointed to the rookie's ability to receive pitches as an area he's done \"well\" and noted his blocking and throwing abilities are still developing. But it's in Herrera's preparation for games where strides have been most evident to the Cardinals skipper.\n\n\"Exposure to this level and realizing how quick the game gets when you're not fully prepared,\" Marmol said. \"I think sometimes it takes that to realize, 'Man I got work to do.' And he realized I got work to do.\"\n\nWith regular playing time as Triple-A Memphis's starting catcher a season ago, the former top-catching prospect made strides in identifying how to attack hitters' weaknesses, maximizing pitcher strengths, and in understanding how to do both while seeing a lineup two or three times over.\n\nThose strides on defense aided him to a breakout year that included a .297 average, 27 doubles, and a .951 OPS in 84 Class AAA games. Herrera's strong minor league campaign earned him Cardinals minor league player of the year honors and instilled confidence in the Cardinals front office to elevate him to a big league backup role and non-tender Andrew Knizner.\n\nFollowing Contreras's injury, Herrera feels his recent opportunities have set him up to contribute.\n\n\"I think this time has helped me gain more confidence,\" Herrera said. \"I don't feel nervous in big spots. I used to feel really nervous. Now it's like, I go out there, like I said, and do my best and put the ball in play and put a good swing on it. Most of the time, I'm just trying to control what I can control. ... I just have a lot of confidence right now that I'm going to be able to do this job.\"\n\nStarting pitching plans\n\nFollowing Wednesday's postponement, the Cardinals will head into their four-game road series against the Brewers with ace Sonny Gray set to start Thursday and Lance Lynn on Friday.\n\nKyle Gibson and Miles Mikolas are likely to start Saturday and Sunday, respectively.\n\nRoycroft strikes out two in debut\n\nWhen he entered from the bullpen in the ninth inning Tuesday night against the Mets, Chris Roycroft felt his first-ever jog to a big-league mound was \"a little nerve-wracking\" given the milestone moment and the rush of energy Busch Stadium provided.\n\nThe 26-year-old rookie and former NCAA Division III product threw six pitches to Mets star Francisco Lindor and got the four-time All-Star to strike out swinging on a 96.8 mph sinker for his first career strikeout against the first batter he faced in his debut.\n\n\"It's really great. I stuck to my plan I executed my plan. Went cutter, cutter, cutter and was able to get the sinker down and away and I got the job done,\" Roycroft said on Tuesday night.\n\nThe career moment was followed by a solo home run allowed to slugger Pete Alonso.\n\n\"Maybe I eased up a little too much on Alonso, but I missed my spot there. But we'll get better there,\" he said.\n\nRoycroft, who was called up Monday, struck out former Cardinal Harrison Bader and, after allowing a single, completed his first inning in the majors by inducing a groundout.\n\nRoycroft said he received the ball from the Lindor strikeout and plans to give it to his mom, who was in attendance Tuesday along with other family and close friends including his stepdad, grandparents and his best friend.\n\n\"It means the world to me,\" said Roycroft, who began his pro career in independent ball after going undrafted. \"Just having them in my corner like they've always been from day one from when I was a D-III kid and in independent ball, they stuck with me the whole way through.\"\n\n0 Comments Tags St. Louis Cardinals Cardinals Baseball Ivan Herrera Willson Contreras Cardinals Vs.

LOUIS -- When Bryan Ramos crossed home plate in the top of the seventh inning, he didn't just score the fourth run of the frame for the Chicago White Sox. He also took what little morale was remaining at Busch Stadium and squashed it flat.\n\nThe Cardinals mustered four hits and took just one at-bat with a runner in scoring position in their 5-1 loss to the White Sox, who entered the series on Friday winners of one road game and one series. After a weekend in St. Louis, they doubled both of those totals. The Cardinals on the other hand fell four games under .500 and back to last place in the National League Central.\n\n\"A day like today, a series like this one, you have to figure out a way to take this series,\" manager Oli Marmol said. \"We didn't even give ourselves opportunities to do that today.\"\n\nNo, the Cardinals did not. In what has become their defining storyline of the season, the offense came up short, leading to a series loss to one of baseball's worst teams.\n\nWhile the poor quality of the opponent adds insult to injury, the most exasperating component of losing the series was its familiarity.\n\n\"It'd be the same answer if you asked what's the most frustrating thing about the season,\" Marmol answered when asked what was most frustrating about the weekend. \"It's that I think so many things are looking good as far as how we want to play the game, the style of the game, what the pitching is doing, what the bullpen is doing. The offense is struggling and that's an area that we honestly felt pretty good about coming into the season. Some guys are adjusting to their second, third year in the league and it's been tough on them. There are no excuses though. The offense is struggling at the moment. We have to find a way out of it.\"\n\nClearly, whatever the Cardinals are doing behind the scenes is not translating to in-game success. Their lineup features seven players who have played at least 20 games and have an OPS lower than .650. The only two regulars with an OPS higher than .700 are Willson Contreras (.937) and Nolan Arenado (.747).\n\nThe players they count on to hit for power and drive in runs have fallen short. Paul Goldschmidt (.208 average, .578 OPS), Nolan Gorman (.182 average, .592 OPS) and Lars Nootbaar (.169 average, .537 OPS) have looked lost since their seasons started and Jordan Walker (.155 average, .498 OPS) struggled so mightily he was optioned to minors.\n\nEven the contact hitters have struggled. Brendan Donovan's on-base percentage sits at .444, but his OPS is .611. Alec Burleson, who has one of the best batted-ball profiles in the organization, has a .635 OPS. Maysn Winn, one of the team's best hitters in April, has tapered off.\n\nStill, Marmol remains high on hitting coach Turner Ward, assistant hitting coach Brandon Allen and game-planning coach Packy Elkins.\n\n\"I like the voices we have, man,\" Marmol said. \"I can't speak higher of Turner, (Allen), (Elkins) and what they do in that department. No one's getting a whole lot of sleep right now, I'll tell you that. They're working at it, they're trying to make sure they're not missing anything. The communication with the players has been really good.\"\n\nThroughout the season's first month, players remained even-keeled despite the severe underperformance. But they're growing weary as the team-wide drought drags on.\n\n\"(Frustration) is high,\" Arenado said after Saturday's loss when St. Louis had the bases loaded with zero outs in the bottom of the 10th inning but failed to score. \"It should be high. I mean, guys shouldn't be OK with what's going on. I know we've got a lot of games left, but that's an ongoing excuse. We can't continue to use that.\n\n\"We just have to continue to push. I don't know what else to say.\"\n\nPerhaps most concerning about the Cardinals' power outage is that there doesn't seem to be any feasible solution other than hoping hitters start feeling better soon. Ward and his staff are backed by the organization, at least for now. The team already shook up the roster once when they demoted Walker to Triple A. Dylan Carlson's activation off the injured list before Sunday's game should help with the outfield's offensive production and Matt Carpenter (strained left oblique) could return to the club in the next few days. But other than that, there isn't a player in Triple A that warrants a call-up, even temporarily.\n\nBottom line: If the Cardinals want to succeed this year, the players they count on to hit need to do so.\n\n\"These are the players we're going to win with,\" Marmol said. \"We have to get them going.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_woo@theathletic.com", "name": "Katie Woo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busch_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Busch Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Donovan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Donovan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Walker_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Walker (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Nootbaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Nootbaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Gorman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Gorman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turner Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contact hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_transactions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball transactions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burleson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burleson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Carpenter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Carpenter (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/05/05194825/USATSI_23198188-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548017", "eventUri": "eng-9548017", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Cardinals don't have choice.", "body": "Benjamin Hochman\n\nCrime is about to go up.\n\nBe it from burglars in Pittsburgh to larcenists in Los Angeles, Tampa Bay raiders to Kansas City thieves.\n\nNot only will it be harder for the Cardinals to score without Willson Contreras in the lineup, it'll also be easier for opponents to score without Willson Contreras behind the plate.\n\nThis season, in just 17 games played, backup catcher Ivan Herrera has allowed 17 stolen bases. And not once has Herrera thrown out a runner.\n\nIt might be baseball's version of death by 1,000 cuts. Simple singles will quietly turn into doubles. And from there, it will take opponents one fewer hit to get one additional run. It's actually kind of frightening for fans to think about.\n\nNow, for cellar-dwelling St. Louis, scoring is the seminal problem.

Johnson: After 26 years of covering St. Louis' music scene, I'm saying goodbye\n\nBut with Herrera catching, the opponents will have an easier time snatching 90-feet advancements of their own.\n\nContreras, who was scheduled for surgery Wednesday on his fractured arm, is out for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd again: 0 for 17. Sounds like a Nolan Gorman offensive stretch or something, but it's Herrera's success rate behind the plate.\n\n\"The (glove-to-hand) exchange and consistency of where he's missing (his throws) is what you're trying to improve,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday prior to the postponement of the Mets-Cards game.\n\nConsider this: There are 20 catchers who have allowed 17 or more steals this season. Only two have yet to throw out a base runner: Herrera (0 for 17 in 145\u2154 innings) and the Mets' Omar Narvaez, who is a preposterous 0 for 30 in just 116 innings played.\n\nAnd of the 20 catchers who have allowed 17 or more steals, only three have played fewer innings than Herrera.\n\nThe Cards are 3-7 in games Herrera has allowed a stolen base. That includes the close and frustrating loss at San Diego when Herrera was particularly terrible behind the plate, allowing a trio of steals.\n\nAnd for some perspective, the Mets are 6-7 in games Narvaez allowed a steal. And in 2023, the Mets were 6-19 in games when Narvaez allowed a steal.\n\nAsked how Herrera can better himself, Marmol said: \"There's arm-strengthening stuff, as far as just being able to get on a long-toss program and actually gain something there. But his footwork, exchange and being able to consistently throw and give himself the best shot on the right side of the bag is what he's working on. A lot of his misses are on that side. And that's something that's technical -- you can improve that.\"\n\nClearly there is much room for improvement, yet not a lot of room to work considering all that goes into the regular preparation for each day's game. The one-time \"Yadier heir\" isn't going to turn into Molina suddenly when the Cards' plane lands in Milwaukee.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to make sure he improves to where he's not a liability.\n\nOverall on defense, Herrera ranks 70th out of 74 catchers in defensive runs saved (minus-4) per Sports Info Solutions. And his defensive run value is in just the 11th percentile per Baseball Savant.\n\n\"I've actually seen the most growth in his preparation,\" Marmol said. \"He receives well, he's continuing to work on his blocking and throwing, but the biggest improvement has been in how he's preparing for the game. And that's allowed him to slow the game down while he's calling it and kind of navigating a lineup and working with the pitcher.\"\n\nMuch has already been made about losing Contreras' bat. The dude was headed for the All-Star Game. Herrera has shown flashes of lightning with his swing -- he's in the 84th percentile for barreled balls -- but he's hitting .232 with a .653 on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nOne good thing is that rookie Cardinal catcher Pedro Pages is a high-level defensive player. So you can, like the Cardinals were going to on Wednesday, start Pages at catcher and Herrera at designated hitter. But that means you'd have to have Pages (career .763 OPS in the minors) take multiple major league at-bats during a game -- this during a time when the Cardinals need as much offense as possible.\n\nBut Marmol already showed some shrewdness the last time Pages was up with St. Louis. Late in a game in which Contreras wasn't catching, Marmol subbed in Pages for Herrera behind the plate. The reason? To reduce steals.\n\n\"It's very important,\" Marmol said Wednesday. \"I mean, depending on who you're playing, there are some teams that run a lot more than others, and you have to defend against that no different than when you make a defensive replacement in center field. If you have a catcher whose strength is that -- and while you're carrying three catchers, it's easier to do, because you still have protection -- you defend against it. And we were in a part of a lineup where I felt like (our opponent's) way of getting back into this game would be by taking the 90 feet. So we made the move and kept that from potentially happening.\"\n\n0 Comments\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify\n\nTags Benjamin Hochman Cardinals Ivan Herrera Willson Contreras

The three-time All-Star suffered a fractured left forearm and is expected to be sidelined for the next 6-8 weeks.\n\nNot only will the St. Louis Cardinals need to pivot at the catcher position, but so will fantasy baseball managers who were relying on the veteran star. Willson Contreras has been enjoying another solid season, posting a .280 batting average with 6 home runs, 20 runs scored, and 12 RBIs before the injury.\n\nAs one of the top catchers yet again in the MLB, fantasy baseball managers will need to look to the trade market or waiver wire to attempt to replace his production. From proven veterans to breakthrough candidates, there are some interesting names that managers could consider.\n\nA closer look at 3 replacements for Willson Contreras in fantasy baseball leagues\n\n#1 - Ivan Herrera\n\nAs a fantasy baseball manager who is looking to replace Willson Contreras in their lineup, why not select his real-life replacement? Although Ivan Herrera might not have the batting average upside of Contreras, he should provide managers with some counting stats.\n\n\"Ivan Herrera knows he has confidence in himself to fill in for Willson Contreras. But it was the work that he has been putting in the past several months that assure him he has his teammates confidence as well. #ForTheLou @KMOXSports\" - @echann7\n\nSo far this season as a backup, Herrera has posted a .232 batting average with 3 home runs and 11 RBIs. The St. Louis Cardinals catchers should see the bulk of starts as the team's catcher, which could make him an intriguing addition in fantasy leagues.\n\n#2 - Elias Diaz\n\nElias Diaz might be the perfect replacement for the type of production that managers have been receiving from Contreras. Although he won't provide much in terms of power, he is elite in batting average, which makes him a perfect fit for teams. So far this season, the veteran has posted an impressive .297 batting average with a pair of home runs and 15 RBIs for the Colorado Rockies.\n\n#3 - Danny Jansen\n\nDanny Jansen has been an interesting asset in fantasy baseball leagues throughout his career. A streaky hitter, when Jansen is hot, he is among the best at the position. Unfortunately, when the Blue Jays catcher is cold, he can be a detriment.\n\n\"Danny Jansen #BlueJays Ranks This Season: AVG - .325 (1st), OBP - .426 (1st), SLG - .700 (1st), OPS - 1.126 (1st) #TOTHECORE\" - @SNstats\n\nThat being said, when Jansen is healthy, he can provide underrated value to fantasy baseball teams.

Monday night's loss to the New York Mets brought with it three runs - a veritable outbreak - and yet all of the damage was contained to the sixth inning, reached in less than 90 minutes as St. Louis hitters went quickly and quietly against opposing starter Sean Manaea.\n\n\"I thought early on, at bats weren't great,\" manager Oli Marmol said following the loss. \"I felt like we competed better, but it still wasn't what was needed tonight.\n\n\"You're always looking for progress,\" he added, \"but we gotta go.\"\n\nFollowing play Monday, the Cardinals find themselves 27th in baseball in percentage of balls barreled, 26th in hard hit percentage, and 28th in weighted on base average. Sorting by traditional counting stats tells the same story. The reason that launch angle and exit velocity have swept into the language of how hitting is discussed across the game is that balls that are hit hard are more likely to go for hits, period, and the Cardinals are not hitting the ball hard.\n\nThe flashing warning sign: the lack of production on balls left over the heart of the plate. Among hitters who have seen at least ten pitches down central, only Alec Burleson - with one - has generated positive run value. Nolan Arenado and Iv\u00e1n Herrera are at a neutral zero, fading all the way out to Paul Goldschmidt's -6 and Brendan Donovan and Lars Nootbaar bringing up the rear at -9.\n\nThis is what it looks like when most of a roster is caught in between, struggling with confidence and pitch recognition. Opposing pitchers can see and smell the blood in the water, and they're feasting. It's hard enough not to get chewed up in the big leagues when weaknesses are far less apparent than they are for the Cardinals at the moment.\n\n\"I think the main thing is being in between pitches and not feeling one thing or another,\" Nootbaar said. \"Whether it's being out front, or deep, or whatever it is. I think that's the best way to describe it.\"\n\n\"For me, it's being on time with the fastball,\" said infielder Jos\u00e9 Ferm\u00edn, who turned in two hits and scored a run Monday in his first crack at hitting leadoff. \"Sometimes when I'm not on the fastball, that's when I get in trouble because I didn't put the barrel on the ball, I started maybe chasing a little bit. But when I'm on time with the fastball, trying to hit it out in front, that's when I get more success.\"\n\n\"When it comes to overall damage when it comes to pulling the ball in the air, that obviously comes to mind [as a concern],\" Marmol said before Monday's game. \"That's where damage is done. We haven't done enough of that. That goes hand in hand with swinging at pitches where you can do that.\n\n\"It's not a matter of reinventing anything. When you feel in between, you end up taking pitches you should swing at and you end up swinging at pitches that you wish you'd laid off of, and you don't take your 'A' swing as often as you'd like. That's just currently where we're at. Frustrating as can be, but it's just where we're at.\"\n\nCardinals starter Kyle Gibson faced many of his current teammates last season as a Baltimore Oriole, taking a hard luck loss in a 1-0 game in September. Despite his success then, and the success of opponents now, his description of the lineup was not of one without the ability for things to click, but rather one which pitchers fear will click against them.\n\n\"It wasn't a fun report to put together [last season] because you have so many hitters that can do damage at any given time,\" Gibson explained. \"You just know that there's some guys on this team that are one AB, one swing, one game away from being unable to get out.\"\n\nGibson, perhaps first among equals in his ability to remain cool under pressure and keep the season in perspective, referred several times to the more than 100 games remaining on the schedule as he preached confidence and calm. That message from the hitting side, and from the manager, has given way in recent days to more pronounced urgency, firmer exhortations.\n\nThere's a whole lot of time left to get things right, but there's really not much left at all to get things right and remain relevant in the race.\n\n\"Sometimes a hit here and there breeds confidence and you build off of that and you get going,\" Marmol said. \"Sometimes you have to fake the confidence until you have some success.\"\n\nThey've faked it enough.

Uh, oh!\n\nWith the loss of Willson Contreras until after the All-Star break, the slumping Cardinals are extremely vulnerable. Contreras has been their best offensive threat, their only veteran hitter performing to his ability.\n\nWriting for USA Today, Jesse Yomtov summed up the Cardinals predicament:\n\nWith their biggest bats struggling to start the season, the Cardinals have lost six of seven entering this weekend's four-game series in Milwaukee, and are tied for last in the majors with just 26 home runs in 36 games.\n\n(Paul) Goldschmidt started May on an 0-for-23 skid and his .550 OPS is the lowest the 2022 NL MVP has posted over any 35-game stretch in his career. Like Goldschmidt, third baseman Nolan Arenado only has two homers.\n\nNolan Gorman (.573) and Lars Nootbaar (.624) are among the other everyday players struggling, with youngsters Victor Scott II and Jordan Walker back in the minors after batting a combined .120 in 144 at-bats.\n\nAdding injury to insult, catcher Willson Contreras (team-high six HR, .950 OPS) is facing a lengthy stint on the injured list after breaking his arm Tuesday on a catcher's interference.\n\nMeanwhile the Brewers have remained one of baseball's better stories while exceeding expectations. They are in the middle of another budget-minded retooling, but they are still fighting to stay in the race.\n\nThey have lost four of their last five games, but Christian Yelich just returned from his latest back injury. Earlier this season he looked like his old self.\n\n\"It's just getting back in the flow of it,\" Yelich told reporters after returning to action with a 0-for-5 game performance against the Kansas City Royals. \"You take that much time off and you're playing catch-up a little bit. I really didn't feel that bad out there for how much time I missed. We'll build on that.\"\n\nESPN.com's Bradford Doolittle gave the Brewers a nod:\n\nIf the Cleveland offense has been the revelation of the AL, the attack of the Brewers is its closest counterpart in the NL. Milwaukee's offense has been more prolific all across the slash indicators even though its strike zone indicators have held steady from 2023. The Brewers are hitting more homers, own a much better team average and, on the bases, have been both more aggressive and more efficient. The avatar of this surprise is second-year second baseman Brice Turang, who has been one of the NL's 10 best players so far. Also, no team has more quality outfield options than Milwaukee.\n\nHere is what folks are writing about Our National Pastime:\n\nDavid Roth, The Defector: \"His time in St. Louis has been fraught, coinciding as it did with the moment that The Cardinals Thing finally seemed to stop working. (Willson) Contreras has also been the team's best all-around player more or less from the moment he arrived, and if you took every catcher in both leagues and graded them out on hitting, power, arm strength, defense, ability to block the baseball, speed, all the different attributes that a player has, and were honest, Contreras has remained one of the very best in the sport. This made it stranger when, by May of last year, seemingly everyone on the Cardinals, from the front office to the manager to the various meatball heroes on the pitching staff, had seemingly settled on Contreras as a scapegoat. Contreras got better, and finished with numbers right around his career norms, but the team stayed salty and bad. After rebuilding the rotation around soft-tossing veterans with various levels of Police Energy in the offseason, the Cardinals have been roughly as inert as they were last year. Only some of this can be blamed on the grimacing 30-somethings in the rotation; the bigger issue has been that basically every hitter in the Cardinals lineup has struggled all season long. At the moment when a J.D. Martinez swing broke Contreras's arm as he reached for a pitch on Tuesday night, Contreras led the Cardinals in every offensive category except batting average, and his .949 OPS was more than 200 points higher than anyone else on the team. They're in last place, and Contreras is going to be out until the All-Star break.\"\n\nAlex Stumpf, MLB.com: \"The wait for Paul Skenes is finally over. The Pirates announced on Wednesday that they are promoting their top prospect to the Majors. Skenes, a fireballing right-hander, is scheduled to make his first start on Saturday against the Cubs at PNC Park (4:05 p.m. ET), according to the club. Skenes was the first overall pick in last year's Draft and is currently ranked as the No. 3 prospect, and top pitcher, in the game by MLB Pipeline. The 6-foot-6 Skenes burst onto the national scene last year with Louisiana State University, being named the Division I National Player of the Year and leading his school to the College World Series title. Armed with a fastball that consistently registers in the triple digits and a wipeout slider, Skenes certainly lived up to the hype during his time in the Minors this year, where he recorded a 0.99 ERA and 45 strikeouts over 27 1/3 innings with Triple-A Indianapolis. He has also developed his pitch repertoire in his time as a professional, mixing in his changeup, curveball and 'splinker' (a sinker-splitter hybrid) more, adding additional weapons to his arsenal.\"\n\nMatt Snyder, CBSSports.com: \"The Houston Astros got stomped on Tuesday night, 10-3, by the New York Yankees with future Hall of Famer Justin Verlander getting hammered for seven runs on eight hits in five innings. Given how the 2024 season has gone for the Astros, it wasn't entirely shocking. The loss dropped them to 12-23, good for last place in the AL West -- a division that includes a team that lost 112 games last season and one that lost Shohei Ohtani in the offseason (and Mike Trout during this season). In fact, the only teams that have a worse record in all of baseball are the utter dregs: the White Sox, Rockies and Marlins. The Marlins already sold off a key piece with the trade of Luis Arraez to the Padres. As they are both on pace to lose 120+ games (for real), we can expect both the Rockies and White Sox to be sellers this season as well. The Astros, meanwhile, are on pace right now to finish 56-106. If that sounds familiar, that was the Astros' record in 2011, the first of three straight pitiful seasons before the tide started to turn for the franchise.\"\n\nJustin Klugh, Baseball Reference: \"The grounder. As far as outcomes go, it lives somewhere above striking out swinging and striking out swinging while falling down. Among the batted balls, it is scoffed at by long flies and sneered at by liners. Sure, some grounders skip and bounce and sizzle down the line past the outreached glove of a corner infielder. Others shoot up the middle after the pitcher barely avoids a mangled shin. But for the most part, they are not a desired result. In fact, they're considered a downright problem when a guy is hitting too many of them. And the Marlins are the best at hitting them! Nobody in baseball is better at hitting ground balls than the Marlins -- as a team, over half their batted balls have stayed on the ground (51.8%). No other team in Major League Baseball does that more than 46% of the time. Because of this frequent occurrence, the Marlins also lead the National League in grounding into double plays (39) and in their groundball to fly ball ratio (1.73).\"\n\nMEGAPHONE\n\n\"I know it's not gonna be easy to do that every night, but we're really capable of doing that and more. Judge has been locked in the last couple of days. I'm really excited for that -- I can't wait to see him going crazy. It's gonna be great. And G, how hard he hits the ball, it's just amazing.

Cardinals don't have choice.", "body": "Be it from burglars in Pittsburgh to larcenists in Los Angeles, Tampa Bay raiders to Kansas City thieves.\n\nNot only will it be harder for the Cardinals to score without Willson Contreras in the lineup, it'll also be easier for opponents to score without Willson Contreras behind the plate.\n\nThis season, in just 17 games played, backup catcher Ivan Herrera has allowed 17 stolen bases. And not once has Herrera thrown out a runner.\n\nIt might be baseball's version of death by 1,000 cuts. Simple singles will quietly turn into doubles. And from there, it will take opponents one fewer hit to get one additional run. It's actually kind of frightening for fans to think about.\n\nNow, for cellar-dwelling St. Louis, scoring is the seminal problem. With a light-hitting offense -- when they even get hits at all -- the Cardinals must muster as many 90-feet advancements as possible to possibly win.\n\nBut with Herrera catching, the opponents will have an easier time snatching 90-feet advancements of their own.\n\nContreras, who was scheduled for surgery Wednesday on his fractured arm, is out for the foreseeable future.\n\nAnd again: 0 for 17. Sounds like a Nolan Gorman offensive stretch or something, but it's Herrera's success rate behind the plate.\n\n\"The (glove-to-hand) exchange and consistency of where he's missing (his throws) is what you're trying to improve,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said Wednesday prior to the postponement of the Mets-Cards game.\n\nConsider this: There are 20 catchers who have allowed 17 or more steals this season. Only two have yet to throw out a base runner: Herrera (0 for 17 in 145\u2154 innings) and the Mets' Omar Narvaez, who is a preposterous 0 for 30 in just 116 innings played.\n\nAnd of the 20 catchers who have allowed 17 or more steals, only three have played fewer innings than Herrera.\n\nThe Cards are 3-7 in games Herrera has allowed a stolen base. That includes the close and frustrating loss at San Diego when Herrera was particularly terrible behind the plate, allowing a trio of steals.\n\nAnd for some perspective, the Mets are 6-7 in games Narvaez allowed a steal. And in 2023, the Mets were 6-19 in games when Narvaez allowed a steal.\n\nAsked how Herrera can better himself, Marmol said: \"There's arm-strengthening stuff, as far as just being able to get on a long-toss program and actually gain something there. But his footwork, exchange and being able to consistently throw and give himself the best shot on the right side of the bag is what he's working on. A lot of his misses are on that side. And that's something that's technical -- you can improve that.\"\n\nClearly there is much room for improvement, yet not a lot of room to work considering all that goes into the regular preparation for each day's game. The one-time \"Yadier heir\" isn't going to turn into Molina suddenly when the Cards' plane lands in Milwaukee.\n\nThe goal, of course, is to make sure he improves to where he's not a liability.\n\nOverall on defense, Herrera ranks 70th out of 74 catchers in defensive runs saved (minus-4) per Sports Info Solutions. And his defensive run value is in just the 11th percentile per Baseball Savant.\n\n\"I've actually seen the most growth in his preparation,\" Marmol said. \"He receives well, he's continuing to work on his blocking and throwing, but the biggest improvement has been in how he's preparing for the game. And that's allowed him to slow the game down while he's calling it and kind of navigating a lineup and working with the pitcher.\"\n\nMuch has already been made about losing Contreras' bat. The dude was headed for the All-Star Game. Herrera has shown flashes of lightning with his swing -- he's in the 84th percentile for barreled balls -- but he's hitting .232 with a .653 on-base plus slugging percentage.\n\nOne good thing is that rookie Cardinal catcher Pedro Pages is a high-level defensive player. So you can, like the Cardinals were going to on Wednesday, start Pages at catcher and Herrera at designated hitter. But that means you'd have to have Pages (career .763 OPS in the minors) take multiple major league at-bats during a game -- this during a time when the Cardinals need as much offense as possible.\n\nBut Marmol already showed some shrewdness the last time Pages was up with St. Louis. Late in a game in which Contreras wasn't catching, Marmol subbed in Pages for Herrera behind the plate. The reason? To reduce steals.\n\n\"It's very important,\" Marmol said Wednesday. \"I mean, depending on who you're playing, there are some teams that run a lot more than others, and you have to defend against that no different than when you make a defensive replacement in center field. If you have a catcher whose strength is that -- and while you're carrying three catchers, it's easier to do, because you still have protection -- you defend against it. And we were in a part of a lineup where I felt like (our opponent's) way of getting back into this game would be by taking the 90 feet. So we made the move and kept that from potentially happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "stltoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "St. Louis Post-Dispatch"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Martinez on Tuesday. This hit came not on a backswing, but on the forward motion of Martinez' swing, and this is likely because the Cardinals have been asking Contreras to set up much closer to the plate than he had previously.\n\nIf you haven't seen this, here's how it happened [VIDEO].\n\nThat's probably as painful as it looks, and the prognosis is for Contreras to be out six to eight weeks.\n\nWhy was this done? This article by Katie Woo in The Athletic explains:\n\nWeeks before Opening Day this season, Major League Baseball sent a memo to all 30 clubs highlighting a rise in catcher's interference. The instances of catchers being struck by the bats of opposing hitters were rising rapidly. Catcher's interference was called 94 times in 2023, nearly 20 more times than in 2022.\n\nWhat was causing the dramatic uptick? Catchers kept moving closer to the plate. In the era of pitch framing, teams deduced that the closer a catcher is to receiving a pitch, the better chance he has to \"steal\" a strike.\n\nThis Talkin' Baseball video shows how much closer Contreras has set up at the plate as a Cardinal, compared to how he did as a Cub. Scroll in to about 15:30:\n\nThat's a significant difference, and you can see how this could lead to more catcher's interference calls. And why is this done? Pitch framing, the attempt to \"steal\" strikes by catchers moving the ball around the zone from where it actually crosses the plate. Sometimes it fools umpires, sometimes it doesn't.\n\nHow could framing (and the resulting catcher's interference calls and potential injuries) be eliminated? Why, of course, start using the automatic ball and strike calling system that's now being used in Triple-A. In Triple-A, full ABS is used in the first three games of each series (Tuesday-Thursday). ABS Challenge is used in the remaining three games (Friday-Sunday). ABS Challenge games start with three appeals available to the active pitcher, catcher or batter. If the challenge is successful, the clubs keeps that challenge.\n\nThis is a great system and in at least one game a couple of years ago, there were 15 (!) challenges, which means in that game the batter, pitcher and catcher might have been calling a better game than the plate umpire.\n\nThe technology exists to implement this system and since the appeals have to be made immediately by the pitcher, catcher or batter, it doesn't take longer than 10-15 seconds for each challenge. MLB players and owners would likely have to approve the use of this system, and might not want to in the middle of a season.\n\nSo what else could be done to improve ball-and-strike calls and perhaps reduce the desire for teams to have catchers who are better at pitch framing?\n\nThere's nothing written in stone that says that umpires HAVE to rotate through all the bases and home plate duty all the time. As we all know, there are some umpires who are better and some who are worse at ball-and-strike calls. I don't think I have to name them here, I'm pretty sure you know who I'm talking about.\n\nSo why not just use the best umpires behind the plate more of the time, and the umpires who, well, aren't good at doing that would be relegated to base duty only? This might have to be negotiated with the umpires' union, because that would mean more games behind the plate for the good ball-and-strike umpires. Obviously that's a tougher day for the plate umpire and so there might have to be more substitute umps, higher pay or both.\n\nEven if this isn't feasible, there's got to be something MLB can do to eliminate pitch framing as a thing. It feels like legalized cheating, in my view, and something that shouldn't be part of the game, and now it's caused a serious injury to a catcher.\n\nThese suggestions were in Katie Woo's article:\n\nWith the league on notice and MLB clearly aware of the risks, what can be done to cut down catcher's interference -- and the inherent injury risk? Cardinals' starting pitcher Miles Mikolas suggested a physical line behind the plate that catchers cannot cross, a box of their own in a way. Could the automated ball-strike system (which theoretically eliminates the value of framing) be the answer? Possibly, but it's an imperfect system in the minor leagues and is far from being a big-league product.\n\nPerhaps this injury can be the catalyst in the same way Buster Posey's injury got the plate collision outlawed. Get it done, MLB.

And if making a pitch look like a strike requires less effort (read: money), then there's no reason to invest in the latter.\n\nWhich is how you end up with a case like Willson Contreras writhing in pain on Wednesday after his arm was shattered by the bat of New York Mets slugger J.D. Martinez while catching for Miles Mikolas.\n\nIt seemed easy to call this a freak injury in the moment, but that's only because the explanation is so obviously senseless you almost can't believe a team would put its $87.5 million All-Star backstop in deliberate danger.\n\nYet here we are. Teams know calling balls and strikes is so subjective that if you place a catcher directly in the swing path of a hitter, you just might be able to block an umpire's field of vision enough to convince them that a low ball was actually a clear strike.\n\nSometimes it works. Sometimes it leads to this:\n\nOfficially, the injury goes down as a forearm fracture requiring surgery and a 6-8 week recovery window. Contreras could be back after the All-Star Game in July. What the injury report won't say is that the cause was workplace indifference to employee safety.\n\n\"It's a huge risk,\" Cardinals manager Oli Marmol told reporters about moving catchers closer to the plate after the game. \"It's been talked about. Even in the offseason it was a topic in discussion because there was an increase in [catchers' interference calls]. The more catchers are evaluated on framing, the more catchers are getting closer to the pitcher in order to get that low pitch.\n\n\"The risk is high. We just experienced it.\"\n\nThis is what happens when you try to Moneyball every aspect of the game. How much is a strike truly worth if the risk is putting one of your most important players on the shelf?\n\nSt. Louis might not be the last to find out the answer to that. Not in a copy-cat league. If one team is getting better calls because of positioning, many will follow their lead. Which is how you go from catcher's interference being called once every 50.6 games in 2023 to once every 32 games in 2024.\n\n\"He's close to the plate trying to steal strikes,\" Mikolas said after the game. \"You know, as pitchers we appreciate that, but you know, if we knew he was going to get hurt, I'd rather throw all balls. ... Thinking about it after the fact, I think there should be a line back there, you know, for the catchers and just have them stay behind the line. That way, no one can get any closer than the next guy. And if you put them back there in a spot that's deemed safe, and you know, that might help guys.\"\n\nThere is simply no reason a catcher should have to put his arm anywhere inside the batter's box and any coach who suggests that as a legitimate strategy should be laughed out of the room. Instead, it's debated and settled on during the offseason as if the game is played on paper.\n\nPitch framing is certainly a skill the same way flopping is a skill in basketball. The only difference is that we know, some day soon, robot umpires are going to make that skill irrelevant. There's no need to game a system that's already on the way out.\n\nThis injury was so avoidable you have to consider firing the coaches who put Contreras in this position. Or at the very least, the next time one of them suggests standing in between J.D. Martinez's bat and a baseball, have them demonstrate how they'd do it first.", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blake_schuster@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Blake Schuster", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Mikolas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miles Mikolas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willson_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willson Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moneyball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez's swing on Tuesday night, the gruesome injury put the spotlight on a baseball trend that has intensified in recent years.\n\nCatchers keep getting closer to the plate, closer to the batter and closer to danger.\n\nCatchers are incentivized to get closer so they can better \"frame\" low pitches for umpires. A popular framing method that has exploded in recent years involves getting under the ball and yanking upward. That can't be done if a catcher is too far back or starting his \"frame\" from too low a starting point.\n\nNot surprisingly, catcher's interference calls have exploded, although most don't end with a broken bone like the serious and painful injury suffered by Contreras.\n\n\"The closer we get to the plate, the more strikes we can grab at the bottom rail,\" said Detroit Tigers manager A.J. Hinch, himself a former catcher. \"Catchers are getting evaluated and they're getting paid on how well they can control the bottom rail, and that's led to more and more catcher interferences throughout the game. I think it's triple what it used to be.\"\n\nTigers catcher Jake Rogers said hitters whose swing makes them a catcher's interference risk are flagged in scouting reports and meetings before every series.\n\nIn the Tigers' last series at New York, Yankees sluggers Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton were flagged for special care.\n\n\"We scoot back,\" Rogers said. \"With Judge and Giancarlo, I was farther back than usual. You have to be aware. With other hitters, you can get closer.\"\n\nMost catcher interference calls happen when the catcher's mitt is lightly nicked by the bat. But Rogers did have one scary moment last August when Astros outfielder Kyle Tucker hit the top of his hand. It hurt, and it's not something he wants to repeat.\n\nBut the incentives to creep closer and closer can't be ignored.\n\n\"The lower pitch will look better to an umpire,\" Rogers said.\n\nHow can baseball solve the problem? The most obvious solution is to move to an automatic ball-strike system -- aka, robo umps. That would eliminate much of the reason for pitch-framing, a skill catchers have spent years cultivating.\n\nBut it could also make the game safer, because the catcher's main job would return to catching, not framing.\n\n\"It's a huge health risk,\" Hinch said. \"That one (with Contreras) was obviously extreme and the Cardinals lost a really good player. We want our guys close enough to be impactful with the low strike but not walking into harm's way that way. So it's a tough balance when the incentive to do it is real, and the risk is extreme.\"", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interference (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

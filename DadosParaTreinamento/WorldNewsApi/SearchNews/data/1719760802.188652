We all know that cheating is never a good idea \u2013 but for those who are determined to do it, one of the biggest things to think about is making sure you don't get caught. So, perhaps trying to sleep with your neighbour isn't the wisest idea \u2013 as it would be pretty easy for your partner to catch you in the act. One man doesn't seem to have thought that far ahead, however, as he has tried making a move on one of his \"direct neighbours\". The woman in question is single, but the man has been married for 20 years \u2013 and his neighbour has \"very clearly\" told him she's not interested. In a post on Mumsnet, the woman recalled telling man she might consider his offer if he was single, but it would be \"unfair to his wife\" to sleep with him behind her back, so she \"made it very clear\" it would not happen. She wrote: \"I get along with him as a neighbour, there's a few of us who all chat and have a laugh. I get on with his wife but I don't see her out and about as often as him. Me and him have never been alone other than if we bump into each other outside the houses. I've never flirted. I wouldn't say that we're close friends but we get on as neighbours \u2013 all of us.\" The woman went on to ask why married men \"look elsewhere\" and said her neighbour should \"just leave\" his wife if he isn't happy instead of trying to cheat on her. She added: \"I just want to clarify again I will not be pursuing it. And even if he did become single I wouldn't be with him as I couldn't trust him. I'm so disappointed. He seemed like such a lovely guy and I've seen this whole other side of him with this. I look at him differently from how I used to. I'm shocked.\" Commenters on the post said the woman wasn't at fault for the man's actions, and urged her to keep denying his advances. One person said: \"He sounds like a real peach. I think telling him you would if he were single was a bad idea though \u2013 that's just encouraging him and letting him know you find him attractive. Keep your distance for the time being \u2013 he'll lose interest soon enough.\" Another added: \"He's behaving this way because he's a selfish d***head who wants an ego boost. It all about him, not you (or his wife). It's not because he particularly likes you or finds you really attractive. It's because you're convenient, has opportunities to flirt and he thinks he's in with a chance. He's a creep and a horrible person.\" Do you have a story to sell?
